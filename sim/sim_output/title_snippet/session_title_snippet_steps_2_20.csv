We used latent class growth analysis to determine patterns (or classes) of pandemic-related food insecurity during a 1-year period.\n\nResults\n\nWe found 10 classes of trajectories of food insecurity, including 1 class of consistent food security (64.7%), 1 class of consistent food insecurity (3.4%), 5 classes of decreasing food insecurity (15.8%), 2 classes of increasing food insecurity (4.6%), and 1 class of stable but elevated food insecurity (11.6%). Relative to the class that remained food secure, other classes were younger, had a greater proportion of women, and tended to identify with a racial or ethnic minority group.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe found heterogeneous longitudinal patterns in the development, resolution, or persistence of food insecurity during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences of food insecurity were highly variable across the US population, with one-third experiencing some form of food insecurity risk. Findings have implications for identifying population groups who are at increased risk of food insecurity and related health disparities beyond the first year of the pandemic.\n\nTop\n\nIntroduction\n\nFood insecurity — which occurs when access to adequate food to live a healthy life is limited by a lack of money or other resources — is a major public health problem in the US that contributes substantially to the burden of chronic disease and poor mental health (1). Food insecurity results in an estimated $77 billion each year in excess health care spending (2). More than 1 in 10 US households experienced food insecurity in 2020 (3). The Healthy People 2020 goal was to reduce the national prevalence of food insecurity to 6%, and this is now the target for Healthy People 2030 (4).\n\nAlong with illness and death in the US (5) and globally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a cascade of economic and social disruptions that increased food insecurity, particularly in its earliest months (6). Data from the US Census Household Pulse Survey showed that food insufficiency (a severe form of food insecurity) rose from 8% in March 2020 to 10% in June 2020 (7). Some households, such as Black and Hispanic or Latino households and households with children, were found to be more vulnerable than other households to food insecurity as a result of the pandemic (3,7). In addition to these national prevalence studies, other studies have estimated food insecurity to be much higher in some samples (8,9); these studies differed in sample representation (online convenience vs community-based samples), study design (cross-sectional vs longitudinal), and food insecurity measures (single vs multiple items) (3,6–9).\n\nThe growing body of evidence shows that experiences of COVID-19 pandemic–related food insecurity varied substantially across the US population. However, most epidemiologic studies cross-sectionally assessed food insecurity during a reference period (eg, the previous 12 months) and did not follow respondents over time to examine variability of experiences during that time. This is an important research gap, because most households with food insecurity tend to experience episodic rather than chronic food insecurity (10). Few studies have characterized the variability of food insecurity over time (11). Measurement of the timing of food insecurity in a more granular fashion has led to important public health and clinical outcomes, including increased use of emergency departments and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia at the end of the month versus earlier weeks of the month based on claims data (12).\n\nThe objective of our study was to characterize the heterogeneity in food insecurity during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified trajectories through repeated measures data that assessed the probability food insecurity every 2 weeks in a nationally representative US sample. Characterizing the heterogeneity in food insecurity during this pivotal period is important to inform public health efforts to reduce food insecurity and its associated health harms, to monitor the impact of food insecurity–related policies, and to prioritize efforts designed for populations at greatest risk of persistent food insecurity.\n\nTop\n\nMethods\n\nData source and sampling\n\nWe used publicly available and deidentified data from the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative panel study of approximately 9,500 adult respondents conducted by the Center for Economic and Social Research at the University of Southern California. Launched in 2014, UAS is an internet panel study that uses an address-based probability sampling strategy and provides internet-connected tablets to respondents to minimize the effects of the digital divide for online survey completion. Each survey of the UAS is approved by the University of Southern California human subjects committee internal review board. In March 2020, UAS launched the Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, a longitudinal series of surveys that assessed economic and health-related indicators during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were administered every 2 weeks from March 10, 2020, through March 30, 2021, then monthly through July 20, 2021.\n\nFor this study, we analyzed data from waves 2 through 25, or April 1, 2020, through March 30, 2021, because these waves occurred during the first year of the pandemic and had consistent measures of food insecurity. A total of 8,425 unique participants responded to at least 1 survey during the study period. We excluded participants from analysis if they did not complete more than 1 survey (n = 429) or did not provide at least 2 waves of responses to the food insecurity measures (n = 52), yielding a total sample of 7,944 unique respondents. On average, these respondents completed 21.3 (SD, 4.7) waves for a total of 148,392 surveys. Of these surveys, 98.6% (n = 146,265) had responses to food insecurity measures. Participants provided informed consent before completing their first survey either electronically or on paper. More information on the survey methodology and sampling can be found at https://uasdata.usc.edu.\n\nMeasures\n\nFood insecurity. Three survey items were adapted from the US Department of Agriculture’s US Household Food Security Survey (13), designed to assess food insecurity in the previous 12 months. Understanding Coronavirus in America survey respondents were asked the following questions in reference to the past 7 days: 1) “Were you worried you would run out of food because of a lack of money or other resources?” 2) “Did you eat less than you thought you should because of a lack of money or other resources?” and 3) “Did you go without eating for a whole day because of a lack of money or other resources?” Answer choices were yes, no, or unsure. For the 3 questions, unsure accounted for 2.6%, 2.1%, and 1.4% of responses, respectively. Given prior research on social desirability bias when assessing food insecurity (14) and the small number of unsure responses, we considered yes and unsure to be affirmative responses. In total, 8.9% of surveys were affirmative for item 1, 7.9% for item 2, and 4.2% for item 3. We coded food insecurity status (binary outcome) as affirmative (yes or unsure) to any of the 3 items.\n\nSociodemographic characteristics. Sociodemographic characteristics were age, binary sex, marital status, race (White or Caucasian [hereinafter White], Black or African American, Native American/American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian/Asian American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, mixed), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino), educational attainment, annual household income, employment status, receipt of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, household composition (no children in household vs children in household), and US Census Bureau–designated geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West). Sociodemographic factors are based on responses to participants’ first survey, collected from April 1, 2020, through March 2, 2021.\n\nAnalysis\n\nWe used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) (15) to identify clusters of people (ie, latent classes) based on variability in their binary response of any food insecurity over time. LCGA is a longitudinal clustering technique that uses latent (unobserved) variables (16,17) and has similarities to other trajectory modeling techniques, including latent growth mixture modeling, but LCGA does not allow for within-class variation in trajectories (18). Classes identified by LCGA are not known a priori and are determined empirically, but because a substantial proportion of survey participants were observed to have no change in food insecurity status over time, we assigned them to either a class that remained food secure or a class that remained insecure throughout the study period (n = 5,317) (19).\n\nWe estimated a trajectory shape for each class, and participants (n = 2,627) were assigned to latent classes according to their posterior probabilities (20). The 1-class solution was first specified, which was then used as a comparison for solutions of increasing class size until the best solution was identified. To identify the optimal number of classes, we evaluated statistical indices and tests and parameter estimates, including likelihood ratio tests, such as the Vuong–Lo–Mendell–Rubin test and Lo–Mendell–Rubin adjusted test, entropy, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), sample-size adjusted BIC, corrected AIC for small sample sizes, and assessment of class cell sizes (16) (Supplemental Table 1 in Appendix). We created a graph in Excel (Microsoft Corporation) of the average probability of endorsing food insecurity at each time within each cluster.\n\nThe food insecurity outcome was binary and represented any affirmative indication of food insecurity. We therefore relied on a commonly used approach for a latent variable model for a binary outcome, which was to assume that a normally distributed latent variable (food insecurity*) exists, from which participants respond affirmatively when the latent variable exceeds some threshold (16). That is, in these models, for individual i across time points\n\nFood Insecurityi = Yes if τ < Food Insecurityi*\n\nwhere τ is the threshold parameter.\n\nThe interpretation of the model coefficients in our LCGA followed from probit analyses. That is, within each cluster, the model coefficient for the linear slope is the change in the z score of a normal distribution for a 1-unit change in time. We assumed linear growth in food insecurity after evaluating descriptive plots and generalized estimating equations models of the longitudinal data in the entire sample. We used the MLR option in Mplus to estimate the model (21), which uses maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters but uses a robust sandwich-type estimator (Huber–White sandwich estimator) to calculate SEs (22). Robust approaches are resistant to errors under small violations of parametric assumptions. Our model also effectively handled ignorable missing data dependent on the data in hand (ie, following a missing-at-random assumption) via full information maximum likelihood. As a result, participants with missing data could still be included in the trajectory analysis for unbiased inference. In total, 80.0% of surveys were completed by all participants with responses to food insecurity questions. We examined sociodemographic factors across each trajectory for descriptive purposes in post hoc analyses.\n\nWe defined α = .05 for our level of significance in all statistical tests, which were 2-tailed. We conducted LCGA in Mplus version 8.6 (21). We used R program in the R studio environment (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) for data management and graphic displays, and we used the MplusAutomation package to automate LCGA estimation and interpretation (23). Sample weights were not included in the LCGA but were used to calculate summary statistics and summarize sociodemographic characteristics, which were calculated by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).\n\nTop\n\nResults\n\nApproximately two-thirds (60.0%) of the sample at first survey were aged 18 to 50 years (Table 1). Just over half of the sample identified as female (53.9%), were married (53.4%), and were currently working (57.2%). The proportion of self-identified race and ethnicity in this sample generally mirrored the overall US population; for race, 75.9% identified as White only, 13.0% as Black only, and 5.6% as Asian only. For ethnicity, 19.1% identified as Hispanic/Latino. Approximately one-third had a bachelor’s degree or more (33.8%), earned more than $75,000 annually (34.4%), had children in the household (34.7%), and were living in the South (38.8%).\n\nFood insecurity trajectories\n\nIn the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020, the prevalence of any food insecurity was as high as 20.4%. The prevalence decreased to 8.9% by March 2021, with most of the decline occurring in the early months, before leveling off in mid-2020 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPrevalence of any food insecurity among respondents (N = 7,944) to the Understanding America Study, Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, April 2020 through March 2021. Shading indicates 95% CIs. [A tabular version of this figure is available.]\n\nWe identified 10 unique trajectories of food insecurity (Figure 2), including the 2 trajectories that were empirically assigned (remained food secure and remained food insecure). Each trajectory can be described by the shape of its curve: 3 trajectories showed little change (remained insecure, remained elevated, and remained secure), 2 trajectories indicated a high probability of initial food insecurity followed by a precipitous decline (named “initial shock 1” and “initial shock 2”), 3 trajectories with a high probability of initial food insecurity followed by a steady state of decline (named “recovering 1,” “recovering 2,” and “recovering 3”), and 2 trajectories with a relatively low probability of initial food insecurity followed by a steady state of incline (named “became insecure 1” and “became insecure 2”).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nProbability of experiencing food insecurity among respondents (N = 7,944) to the Understanding America Study, Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, April 2020 through March 2021. Three categories (remained secure, remained insecure, and remained elevated) were characterized as consistent. Two categories (initial shock 1 and initial shock 2) were characterized by a rapid decline in food insecurity status between March and July 2020. Three categories (recovering 1, recovering 2, and recovering 3) were defined as having experienced food insecurity initially, with the likelihood steadily declining during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two categories (became insecure 1 and became insecure 2) were defined as steadily becoming food insecure during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Abbreviation: FDA, Food and Drug Administration. [A tabular version of this figure is available.]\n\nAlthough most (64.7%) of the US-representative sample was in the “remained secure” category, 35.3% experienced some form of food insecurity (with 3.4% remaining insecure) during the first year of the pandemic (Table 2). Within that 35.3%, we found much variability. In addition to the 2 groups whose food security/insecurity status did not change, another group showed minimal changes: this group was mostly food secure during the study period but had an elevated prevalence of food insecurity, beginning at 13.6% in April 2020 and ending at 7.5% in March 2021. This group, “remained elevated,” comprised 11.6% of the study population.\n\nFive groups experienced some early form of food insecurity, but their probability of being food insecure declined over time. Two such trajectories, initial shock 1 (4.6% of the study population) and initial shock 2 (3.2% of the study population), appear to have briefly experienced food insecurity. This experience may have been largely related to the initial economic shutdowns in the earliest months of the pandemic in 2020, wherein states and municipalities issued stay-at-home or lockdown orders to mitigate the spread of the virus. These 2 trajectories are distinguished by the length of time needed for food insecurity to be resolved. Participants classified as initial shock 1 took about 16 weeks to resolve, while initial shock 2 was resolved within 8 weeks.\n\nThree groups took longer to recover from food insecurity experienced earlier in the pandemic: “recovering 1” (4.3%) ended the first year at a slightly elevated probability of food insecurity, while “recovering 2” (2.6%) and “recovering 3” (1.1%) had a similar rate or slope of recovery but a different initial probability of food insecurity.\n\nThe probability of becoming food insecure increased during the first year of the pandemic for 2 groups. These 2 trajectories, “became insecure 1” (3.1%) and “became insecure 2” (1.5%), had nearly the same rate or slope of becoming food insecure but their initial probability of food insecurity differed.\n\nAlthough small sample sizes and corresponding wide 95% CIs in some groups precluded a statistical comparison of sociodemographic characteristics across trajectories, characteristics appeared to differ in several ways (Supplemental Table 2A and 2B in Appendix). Those who remained food secure, compared with those in other trajectories, tended to be older, self-identified as White, and had a greater income at first interview.\n\nTop\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study is among the first to describe population-level longitudinal patterns in the development, resolution, or persistence of food insecurity during a key time of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing heterogeneity in food insecurity experiences during this period. Notably, one-third of the population was found to experience any food insecurity when assessed longitudinally, whether food insecurity existed from the start and persisted (for approximately 15%), improved (for approximately 16%), or worsened (for approximately 5%). With careful attention to not overextend the findings of this initial study, we also observed that certain patterns of food insecurity corresponded with pivotal periods during the first year of the pandemic, starting with abrupt and widespread economic shutdowns in the earliest months. We found 2 patterns of food insecurity that occurred mainly in the earliest months of the pandemic before resolving relatively shortly thereafter (ie, initial shock 1 and initial shock 2). Therefore, an important consideration raised by our findings relates to the definition and measurement of food insecurity when accounting for the many factors that drive food insecurity.\n\nWhile food insecurity at the individual level occurs when access to adequate food is limited or uncertain because of a lack of money or other resources (13), the pillars of food security in a global context also include availability, use, and stability (24). The pandemic introduced a host of other factors described elsewhere (ie, business and school closures, supply chain issues, and stockpiling of groceries and resulting shortages) (6,25) that affected experiences of food insecurity for reasons beyond a person’s lack of access caused by money. Our findings, particularly data on the initial shock 1 and initial shock 2 groups, may speak to food insecurity experiences that were driven more by societal disruptions than by economic or financial uncertainty at the individual level. For instance, while worrying about running out of food before being able to buy more is a key screening question for food insecurity (14), affirmative responses to this question could have also been driven by factors that go beyond having enough money for food. That respondents in the initial shock 2 group appeared to share similar sociodemographic characteristics with respondents in the group that remained food secure raises new considerations in defining and measuring food insecurity in the context of a novel global pandemic.\n\nSeveral patterns of food insecurity described here, such as the one for people who remained food insecure during the entire study period, are particularly concerning. Because nearly half of those in the remained insecure group were SNAP recipients at the outset of the study period, this group may represent a small but important population for whom existing food insecurity protection policies were already not sufficient or whose food insecurity was not being adequately addressed before the pandemic. Groups that showed increases in the probability of food insecurity over time also warrant attention; 2 groups, “became insecure 1” and “became insecure 2,” were worse off 1 year after the onset of the pandemic than at the beginning. Although small sample sizes preclude us from making reliable sociodemographic comparisons, findings suggest that the initial probability of food insecurity distinguished the trajectories of these 2 groups.\n\nSeveral lessons can be learned from populations that experienced food insecurity early in the pandemic but either recovered entirely or were headed toward recovery 1 year later. In studies of food insecurity after other large-scale and highly disruptive events, such as Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana (26) and Hurricane Harvey in Texas (27), findings highlighted several sociodemographic characteristics as protective factors (ie, income, partner status) and risk factors (ie, low levels of social support, poor physical or mental health, female sex/gender) for remaining food insecure in the year(s) after the events. Notably absent in the literature is substantive longitudinal research on the impact of recovery policies. Given the wide berth of policies implemented in the US in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial opportunity exists to explore how these policies, such as those directly aimed at reducing food insecurity or unemployment, may have contributed to each trajectory to identify what aspects of each policy either contributed to recovery or inhibited it.\n\nA wealth of research demonstrates the relationship among income, employment status, and food insecurity. However, the confluence of various local, state, and federal responses to the pandemic provides a unique microcosm for examining a more direct impact on food insecurity. One multisite analysis found that food insecurity was highest during the pandemic among those who experienced job disruptions (28). The initial expiration of unemployment insurance at the federal level at the end of July 2020, along with the general uncertainty about its extension or even the future COVID-19 landscape, likely played a role in the upward trend in overall food insecurity observed around August 2020 (29,30). Further work in this area may entail examining how the economic impact of business closures and unemployment insurance claims (31) may have affected trajectories of food insecurity. For instance, researchers could examine the association of food insecurity trajectories with the comparative efficiency with which states implemented unemployment policies. Furthermore, research using other data sources would be necessary to examine the influence of policies such as the expanded child tax credit.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur study has several limitations. Measures of food insecurity were examined only during the first year of the pandemic and did not account for food insecurity experienced before the pandemic nor their trajectory as the pandemic extended beyond March 2021. This study also assumed that all LCGA model assumptions were met in this sample for valid inference (ie, within-class multivariate normality) (32). We did perform more robust inference in case model parametric assumptions that were violated. Another limitation is that in our chosen 10-class solution, some classes had small cell sizes, and the entropy values and some of the averages of posterior probability of membership were low (2 clusters had an average posterior probability of membership below the threshold of 0.70 considered as a general guideline for adequate assignment accuracy) (33). Thus, we chose as our selection criteria global model fit and thorough interpretability of the possible clustering in this data (ie, more clusters, each unique in characteristic) over a more precise solution involving fewer classes. The small sample sizes in some classes preclude formal comparisons of sociodemographic differences across classes, although we note that those who remained food secure tended to belong to historically advantaged sociodemographic groups, whereas racial and ethnic minority populations were more likely to experience other trajectories of food insecurity (34). Across the 10 classes that were identified here, the group least vulnerable to food insecurity — remained secure — had the highest proportion of respondents who self-identified as White, earned an annual income exceeding $75,000 per year, and had completed a bachelor’s degree or more.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur findings highlighted population-level heterogeneity in the experience of food insecurity in the US throughout the first year of the pandemic, particularly in demonstrating the large variability of population response to the pandemic in food insecurity experiences. These initial findings have implications for identifying population groups who are at increased risk of food insecurity and food-insecurity–related health disparities beyond the first year of the pandemic, with particular attention to those whose risk remained high, remained elevated, or increased over time. The findings here also provide an opportunity and suggest a need for public health researchers to take a more granular look at how policies may have affected food insecurity during the first year of the pandemic.\n\nTop\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe project described in this article relies on data from survey(s) administered by the UAS, which is maintained by the Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) at the University of Southern California (USC).

That's 3.5 million more than the prior year. Families with children and people of color experienced higher than average rates of food insecurity."", 'Full_text': 'Just putting three meals a day on the table was a struggle for millions of people in the U.S. last year. That\'s the sobering conclusion of a new report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which found hunger in the U.S. rose sharply in 2022.\n\nThe report found that 44.2 million people lived in households that had difficulty getting enough food to feed everyone in 2022, up from 33.8 million people the year prior. Those families include more than 13 million children experiencing food insecurity, a jump of nearly 45 percent from 2021.\n\n""These numbers are more than statistics. They paint a picture of just how many Americans faced the heartbreaking challenge last year of struggling to meet a basic need for themselves and their children,"" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said in a statement.\n\nThe findings reverse a decade-long decline in hunger and food insecurity in the U.S. And they reflect the loss of several pandemic-era measures designed to strengthen the social safety net, says Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies food insecurity and federal nutrition programs.\n\n""A lot of the programs that had buffered people\'s experience during the pandemic were retired or rolled back in some way,"" Waxman says.\n\nThose programs included an expanded child tax credit that gave families with children extra money, temporarily increased benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP – formerly known as food stamps – and free school meals for every child.\n\nAt the same time, food prices and housing costs have shot up, says Kelly Horton, chief program officer at the Food Research and Action Center. And she points out an increasing number of Americans are working in unstable gig-economy jobs, like delivering groceries, driving for ride-share services or completing tasks on demand.\n\n"" So all of these things converging...we have a lot of people who are living on the edge,"" Horton says.\n\nIn its report, the USDA found that nearly 7 million households were so financially squeezed last year that they had to skip meals at times because there wasn\'t enough food to go around. Almost all of these households said they couldn\'t afford to eat balanced meals. In some 381,000 households with children, kids also experienced the pangs of hunger – skipping meals or going the whole day without eating. Waxman notes this could have significant health consequences, especially for kids.\n\n""In particular, we worry about that for children because their trajectory now influences what happens to them later,"" says Waxman. She notes research has found children who experience food insecurity are more likely to experience worse health outcomes down the road, including cognitive or developmental delays and higher rates of hospitalization.\n\nOverall, households with children and those of color experienced food insecurity at significantly higher rates than the national average. The rates of hunger for Black and Latino households were both more than double the rates for white households.\n\nFood access advocates say the findings underscore the importance of protecting social safety-net programs. Right now, there\'s particular concern when it comes to the fate of the food assistance program known as WIC, which serves pregnant mothers and young children up to age 5.\n\nSince the pandemic-era increases to SNAP benefits ended, more families have been turning to WIC for help with food, says Nell Menefee-Libey, public policy manager at the National WIC Association.\n\n""We know that more families are turning to the program and find themselves needing support from WIC who may previously have not been using WIC services,"" Menefee-Libey says.\n\nBut some lawmakers have proposed funding cuts to WIC benefits, even as the program needs additional funding to serve the increased number of families that are seeking assistance, says Horton of FRAC.\n\n""So there could be a case where WIC runs out of money if Congress does not give them additional funds,"" Horton says.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/food-insecurity-in-the-time-of-covid', 'Headline': 'Food Insecurity in the Time of COVID - Johns Hopkins', 'Snippet': 'The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated food insecurity globally, with especially dire impacts in low- and middle-income countries. ... lockdowns especially posed a threat to global nutrition efforts, including the disbursement of iron supplements through prenatal care for pregnant people at high risk of anemia; food assistance for families, such as ...', 'Full_text': 'Even before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted food supplies, health systems, and global nutrition programs, 800 million around the world were undernourished (supplied with less than the minimum amount of the nutrients or foods essential for sound health and growth). Children were especially vulnerable: 144 million children under five were stunted (low height-for-age). 47 million children were affected by wasting, a life-threatening form of malnutrition.\n\nAs nutrition policy expert Rebecca Heidkamp and co-authors wrote in a Nature study, “the world was already not on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2—to eliminate hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.”\n\nThe goal of their study was to model the potential short- and long-term impacts the pandemic would have on nutrition and recommend policies to mitigate damage.\n\nWith modeling tools, they were able to determine potential impacts under optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenarios from 2020 to 2022. One big challenge was that the pandemic itself interfered with capturing critical data—in this case, an exact count of wasted and stunted children.\n\n“We’ve been struggling to know what the actual impacts have been,” says Heidkamp, PhD, an associate scientist in International Health who specializes in developing nutrition policy in low- and middle-income countries. At the start of the pandemic, UN agencies, including WHO and UNICEF, were dependent on phone surveys to collect data. This meant researchers “couldn’t go out and actually measure women and children,” she says, and “that’s what we care about in nutrition.”\n\nThe study points to evidence from phone surveys in Asia and Africa revealing disruptions in food supply chains and a spike in food prices resulted in dramatic increases in poverty and food insecurity in 2020, forcing families to shift to poorer diets.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, countries like India and Brazil have adapted and scaled up government assistance programs and social safety net programs, such as social protection and cash and food transfers, but public health experts predict these efforts will be insufficient to return to living standards seen prior to the pandemic.\n\nStanding Together for Nutrition: A Trusted, Unified Voice\n\nEarly in the pandemic, lockdowns especially posed a threat to global nutrition efforts, including the disbursement of iron supplements through prenatal care for pregnant people at high risk of anemia; food assistance for families, such as staples like flour, cereal, beans, and lentils; and routine interventions to prevent and treat acute malnutrition. In addition, school closures halted school feeding programs.\n\nThe crisis led to the creation of a research and advocacy consortium involving several Bloomberg School faculty including Heidkamp, called Standing Together for Nutrition, or ST4N.\n\nThe group includes nutrition, economics, and food and health systems experts. Their goal: to identify the potential impacts of COVID—and now the war in Ukraine—on food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries, and ultimately recommend nutrition interventions to mitigate excess stunting and child mortality.\n\n“Now rising costs of products used to treat malnutrition are threatening to interrupt those programs as they cannot reach as many, even as the need goes up,” says Heidkamp.\n\nThe study reports that in 2019, the UN World Food Programme estimated that 150 million people in 81 different countries needed food assistance. In February of 2022, it rose to 276 million people. The agency predicts that number to increase to 323 million this year alone.\n\nHeidkamp anticipates that 2022 will be a big advocacy year for nutrition. “There are many challenges as we look ahead. … but we need to keep shining the light on these issues and figure out who the right global players will be,” she says.\n\nIn the Nature piece, Heidkamp and co-authors urge “governments, donors, and the UN to help prevent a major exacerbation of malnutrition.” They recommend succinct steps these players must take to build more sustainable food systems that can help support affordable and nutritious diets for all:\n\nEnd trade restrictions that affect access to nutrition.\n\nSustain or implement social protection programs.\n\nProtect national nutrition budgets.\n\nHonor commitments already made.\n\nMobilize more resources for humanitarian assistance.\n\nHeidkamp says it’s donors and affluent groups like the World Bank that have the power to strongly influence other countries toward ending trade restrictions, implementing social protection programs, and activating humanitarian assistance in order to end food insecurity and malnutrition.\n\nGrace Fernandez is a communications and marketing specialist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nRELATED:'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9536538/', 'Headline': 'Pestilence and famine: Continuing down the vicious cycle with COVID-19', 'Snippet': 'Lockdowns, supply chain issues, mass job losses, and political crises exacerbated major socioeconomic challenges and furthered food scarcity and inaccessibility.

The report also looks at ways in which governments can repurpose their current support to agriculture to reduce the cost of healthy diets, mindful of the limited public resources available in many parts of the world.\n\nThe report was jointly published today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe numbers paint a grim picture:\n\nAs many as 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021 – 46 million people more from a year earlier and 150 million more from 2019.\n\nAfter remaining relatively unchanged since 2015, the proportion of people affected by hunger jumped in 2020 and continued to rise in 2021, to 9.8% of the world population. This compares with 8% in 2019 and 9.3% in 2020.\n\nAround 2.3 billion people in the world (29.3%) were moderately or severely food insecure in 2021 – 350 million more compared to before the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic. Nearly 924 million people (11.7% of the global population) faced food insecurity at severe levels, an increase of 207 million in two years.\n\nThe gender gap in food insecurity continued to rise in 2021 - 31.9% of women in the world were moderately or severely food insecure, compared to 27.6% of men – a gap of more than 4 percentage points, compared with 3 percentage points in 2020.\n\nAlmost 3.1 billion people could not afford a healthy diet in 2020, up 112 million from 2019, reflecting the effects of inflation in consumer food prices stemming from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in place to contain it.\n\nAn estimated 45 million children under the age of five were suffering from wasting, the deadliest form of malnutrition, which increases children’s risk of death by up to 12 times. Furthermore, 149 million children under the age of five had stunted growth and development due to a chronic lack of essential nutrients in their diets, while 39 million were overweight.\n\nProgress is being made on exclusive breastfeeding, with nearly 44% of infants under 6 months of age being exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2020. This is still short of the 50% target by 2030. Of great concern, 2 in 3 children are not fed the minimum diverse diet they need to grow and develop to their full potential.\n\nLooking forward, projections are that nearly 670 million people (8% of the world population) will still be facing hunger in 2030 – even if a global economic recovery is taken into consideration. This is a similar number to 2015, when the goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition by the end of this decade was launched under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nAs this report is being published, the ongoing war in Ukraine, involving two of the biggest global producers of staple cereals, oilseeds and fertilizer, is disrupting international supply chains and pushing up the prices of grain, fertilizer, energy, as well as ready-to-use therapeutic food for children with severe malnutrition. This comes as supply chains are already being adversely affected by increasingly frequent extreme climate events, especially in low-income countries, and has potentially sobering implications for global food security and nutrition.\n\n“This report repeatedly highlights the intensification of these major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition: conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks, combined with growing inequalities,” the heads of the five UN agencies (2) wrote in this year's Foreword. “The issue at stake is not whether adversities will continue to occur or not, but how we must take bolder action to build resilience against future shocks.”\n\nRepurposing agricultural policies\n\nThe report notes as striking that worldwide support for the food and agricultural sector averaged almost US$ 630 billion a year between 2013 and 2018. The lion's share of it goes to individual farmers, through trade and market policies and fiscal subsidies. However, not only is much of this support market-distorting, but it is not reaching many farmers, hurts the environment and does not promote the production of nutritious foods that make up a healthy diet. That's in part because subsidies often target the production of staple foods, dairy and other animal source foods, especially in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Rice, sugar and meats of various types are most incentivized food items worldwide, while fruits and vegetables are relatively less supported, particularly in some low-income countries.\n\nWith the threats of a global recession looming, and the implications this has on public revenues and expenditures, a way to support economic recovery involves the repurposing of food and agricultural support to target nutritious foods where per capita consumption does not yet match the recommended levels for healthy diets.\n\nThe evidence suggests that if governments repurpose the resources they are using to incentivize the production, supply and consumption of nutritious foods, they will contribute to making healthy diets less costly, more affordable and equitably for all.\n\nFinally, the report also points out that governments could do more to reduce trade barriers for nutritious foods, such as fruits, vegetables and pulses.\n\n(1) It is estimated that between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021. The estimate is presented as a range to reflect the added uncertainty in data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. The increases are measured with reference to the middle of the projected range (768 million).\n\n(2) For FAO - QU Dongyu, Director-General; for IFAD - Gilbert F. Houngbo, President; for UNICEF - Catherine Russell, Executive Director; for WFP - David Beasley, Executive Director; for WHO - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General.\n\nWhat they said\n\nFAO Director-General QU Dongyu: “Low-income countries, where agriculture is key to the economy, jobs and rural livelihoods, have little public resources to repurpose. FAO is committed to continue working together with these countries to explore opportunities for increasing the provision of public services for all actors across agrifood systems.”\n\nIFAD President Gilbert F. Houngbo: “These are depressing figures for humanity. We continue to move away from our goal of ending hunger by 2030. The ripple effects of the global food crisis will most likely worsen the outcome again next year. We need a more intense approach to end hunger and IFAD stands ready to do its part by scaling up its operations and impact. We look forward to having everyone's support.”\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell: “The unprecedented scale of the malnutrition crisis demands an unprecedented response. We must double our efforts to ensure that the most vulnerable children have access to nutritious, safe, and affordable diets -- and services for the early prevention, detection and treatment of malnutrition. With so many children’s lives and futures at stake, this is the time to step up our ambition for child nutrition – and we have no time to waste.”\n\nWFP Executive Director David Beasley: “There is a real danger these numbers will climb even higher in the months ahead. The global price spikes in food, fuel and fertilizers that we are seeing as a result of the crisis in Ukraine threaten to push countries around the world into famine. The result will be global destabilization, starvation, and mass migration on an unprecedented scale. We have to act today to avert this looming catastrophe.”\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “Every year, 11 million people die due to unhealthy diets. Rising food prices mean this will only get worse. WHO supports countries’ efforts to improve food systems through taxing unhealthy foods and subsidising healthy options, protecting children from harmful marketing, and ensuring clear nutrition labels. We must work together to achieve the 2030 global nutrition targets, to fight hunger and malnutrition, and to ensure that food is a source of health for all.”\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nAcute food insecurity: food insecurity found in a specified area at a specific point in time and of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration. Has relevance in providing strategic guidance to actions that focus on short-term objectives to prevent, mitigate or decrease severe food insecurity.\n\nHunger: an uncomfortable or painful sensation caused by insufficient energy from diet. Food deprivation. In this report, the term hunger is synonymous with chronic undernourishment and is measured by the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU).\n\nMalnutrition: an abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive intake of macronutrients and/or micronutrients. Malnutrition includes undernutrition (child stunting and wasting, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies) as well as overweight and obesity.\n\nModerate food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which people face uncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been forced to reduce, at times during the year, the quality and/or quantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other resources. It refers to a lack of consistent access to food, which diminishes dietary quality and disrupts normal eating patterns. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.\n\nSevere food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which, at some time during the year, people have run out of food, experienced hunger and at the most extreme, gone without food for a day or more. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.""}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/USDA-food-security-report-2022', 'Headline': 'Addressing 2022 USDA Food Security Report | Feeding America', 'Snippet': 'Contact.

This is an increase of 31% for all individuals and 44% for children from the previous year, the highest rate and number of individuals and children since 2014 and the largest one-year increase in food insecurity since 2008. The USDA report confirms what Feeding America heard from people facing hunger in its 2023 Elevating Voices: Insights Report, where people surveyed agreed that federal and local governments should treat food insecurity as an urgent crisis despite headlines asserting an improving economy and lower unemployment rates.\n\n“The USDA released data showing that 1 in 7 people, including 1 in 5 children, in the U.S live in food insecure households,” said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, Feeding America CEO. “This news is heartbreaking, but sadly, it is not surprising. People facing hunger have shared with us that the end of pandemic-era relief efforts and the high cost of food have impacted their ability to make ends meet. I see the long lines myself as I travel across the country. Food banks have been reporting that they are operating under increasing pressure from both sides: the growing number of people experiencing food insecurity and a diminished supply of nutritious food to distribute. Food donations and fundraising have decreased since the pandemic, and while we know the USDA has been working to help, it simply has not been enough.”\n\nThe increase in food insecurity reinforces what the Feeding America network reports seeing in its food bank pulse survey data. Responding food banks reported a continued need with 90% seeing demand for food assistance increase or stay the same in August 2023 compared to July. In 2022, 49 million people turned to the charitable food sector for help with the Feeding America network of food banks distributing more than 5.3 billion meals to neighbors facing hunger.\n\n“This marked increase in people experiencing food insecurity comes alongside reports of lower unemployment and an improved economy,” said Babineaux-Fontenot. “How can this be true? People facing hunger have been answering this question for us, and there are two important factors. First, food insecurity does not happen in a vacuum. Housing prices and other cost of living increases create a gap in income, and food is often the first place where families can cut corners to make ends meet. Second, increases in income often cause low-income families to lose benefits, like childcare subsidies and housing subsidies, which leaves families with higher expenses at the end of the month and less to spend on groceries than before their income increased.”\n\nAccording to the USDA report:\n\nFood insecurity among single mothers was nearly 34%, an increase of 37% compared to 2021.\n\nNotably, food insecurity among households receiving SNAP benefits also increased, with nearly 47% reporting they experienced food insecurity.\n\nFood insecurity increased for Black, white, and Latino individuals. However, food insecurity rates continue to be higher for and disproportionately impact people of color, showing the effect of racial disparities on communities:\n\nBlack individuals saw a 15% increase in food insecurity and were nearly 2.4 times more likely to face hunger than white individuals.\n\nLatino individuals saw a 29% increase in food insecurity and were 2.2 times more likely to face hunger than white individuals.\n\nWhite individuals saw a 43% increase in food insecurity in 2022.\n\nNeighbors experiencing food insecurity have outlined what they need to thrive: Hunger relief today and an end to food insecurity for good will require continued partnership across sectors, geographies and politics.\n\n“These are solvable problems when we all work together and make sound policies a priority,” said Babineaux-Fontenot. “We know this because we saw it work during the pandemic. Today’s data confirms that and reinforces the imperative that Congress must pass a strong farm bill that invests in nutrition programs - especially TEFAP that moves healthy food from farms to food banks - and strengthening SNAP so people experiencing food insecurity have greater purchasing power at their local grocery store. Congress must also work together to honor our service members in uniform and all federal employees and ensure there is no government shutdown. We demonstrated during the pandemic that we are capable of coming together to make positive change for the people in our country, and we can all agree that no one in the U.S. should go hungry. The time to come together and act with that shared conviction is now.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-hunger-rates-rise-pandemic-aid-ends-data-shows-2023-06-28/', 'Headline': 'US hunger rates rise as pandemic aid ends, data shows', 'Snippet': 'Food insecurity is rising in the U.S. as the end of pandemic-era aid and higher food costs strain low-income Americans, according to data released on Wednesday by the U.S. Census Bureau and two ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2023/22_0212a.htm', 'Headline': 'Food Insecurity Trajectories in the US During the First Year of the ...', 'Snippet': 'Preventing Chronic Disease (PCD) is a peer-reviewed electronic journal established by the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.

Malnutrition is less about food than about socioeconomic factors such as conflict, poverty, and global disasters such as climate change and the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nutrition and infectious disease exist in an intricate dance. Adequate and balanced nutrition is critical for appropriate response to infection and any changes in the balance can serve as a tipping point for the next pandemic. On the other hand, pandemics, such as COVID-19, lead to greater malnutrition. Both over- and undernutrition increase severity of disease, alter vaccine effectiveness, and potentially create conditions for viral mutation and adaptation—further driving the disease and famine vicious cycle. These long-term health and socioeconomic repercussions have direct effects at individual and global levels and lead to long-term consequences. Therefore, investing in and strengthening public health, pandemic prevention, and nutrition programs become vital at a much more complex systems level.\n\nCitation: Hyder S, Chhem RK, Claes F, Karlsson EA (2022) Pestilence and famine: Continuing down the vicious cycle with COVID-19.

Around 536 AD, a volcano erupted—possibly in Iceland—spilling millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere across the Northern Hemisphere [1]. The sun disappeared for 18 months. Crops failed. Millions starved. It also likely sparked the Plague of Justinian (the first documented bubonic or “Black” plague), leading to more famine and devastation. It happened again in the 1300s. A volcanic eruption somewhere in New Zealand led to years of cool, rainy weather preventing crops from ripening in Europe [2]. Waves of respiratory diseases further weakened the population, leading to greater famine. This Great Famine possibly primed an undernourished, weakened population for the Black Death to ravage through Europe in 1346, killing more than a third of the population [3]. In 1815, Mount Tambora erupted in Indonesia, causing “the year without summer” and, as a long-term consequence, the Irish Potato Famine of 1845, which led to mass starvation and many death from communicable diseases [4].\n\nAre we detecting commonality here? The historical and biological Butterfly Effect of disease during a famine (or famine during outbreak) is an intricate dance. Infectious disease and malnutrition amplify bidirectionally. Catastrophes such as natural disasters, climate change, war, and economic collapse lead to starvation and infection. Weakened immune systems reduce resistance to further infection, and, ultimately, more malnutrition in a vicious cycle with long-lasting impacts on public health [5].\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic may not directly involve a volcano, history repeats itself. Disease leads to increased poverty, hunger, and changes in socioeconomic behaviors. Thus, insights from past pandemics frame the current COVID-19 hunger crisis and can inform actions to mitigate negative consequences from COVID-19 and future disease outbreaks. One of the most lasting legacies of the pandemic will be increased malnutrition—both undernutrition and obesity (Fig 1). These scars will echo with resounding implications, not only for pandemic recovery, but also for the future of emerging and endemic infectious diseases. Several factors should be considered to reflect on the future of nutrition and infectious disease through the lens of COVID-19:\n\nHunger: What doesn’t kill you, just makes you more vulnerable to something else killing you\n\nEvery year, over 5.5 million children die before the age of 5, mostly in Africa and Asia [6]. Half of these children are undernourished. Why? Apart from the necessity of food for sustaining life, nutritional deficiencies decrease immune response, resulting in increased susceptibility, severity, and mortality from diseases. Indeed, about 32% of the global infectious disease burden could be alleviated by eliminating malnutrition [7]. Undernourished children are more susceptible to respiratory infections, diarrhea, measles, and malaria, to name a few [7]. Unfortunately, infection also leads to poor nutrition by causing anorexia and malabsorption and increasing nutrition requirements for immune cells. This leads to even more undernutrition, increasing susceptibility to disease, and moving further down the vicious cycle [8,9].\n\nThe weight of obesity in infectious disease\n\nMalnutrition isn’t just about not having enough food, it’s also about eating too much. Obesity impairs immune function, leading to increased susceptibility to infection with a number of different pathogens including influenza and COVID-19 [10]. Why? Because your fat also talks to your immune system. Obesity alters adipose tissue signaling, resulting in miscommunication with the immune response and compromising function to deal with infections [11]. Therefore, this interrelationship between adipose tissue, immune response, and infections can exacerbate infection.\n\nYou are what your mother and mother’s mother ate\n\nThere is a direct linkage between maternal malnutrition and the nutritional status of her child. Early malnutrition significantly increases the risk of developing chronic diseases in adults, resulting in a weakened immune response to infectious diseases, and, beyond the age of 2 to 3 years, the effects of chronic malnutrition become almost irreversible [12,13]. Children of women who lived through the Hungry Winter of 1944 to 1945 in the Netherlands and the Chinese Great Famine of 1959 to 1961 faced higher rates of obesity, increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and increased rates of diabetes [12–14]. Even the grandchildren of these women were smaller than average and had a higher chance of becoming obese during adulthood [14]. But we shouldn’t point fingers at moms just yet. The nutritional environment both before conception and throughout gestation influences adult metabolism, but they are just one factor that involved in development.\n\nVaccination efficacy is like a bowl of porridge\n\nWhile opinions on vaccination are undoubtedly mixed, we cannot deny vaccines have greatly improved public health. Smallpox was eradicated in 1979. Polio, measles, and diphtheria are becoming rare. However, vaccine efficacy requires a functional immune system and nutrition is key to bolstering the immune response. Indeed, nutrition is a tipping point on the scales of immunity. Like Goldilocks, effective immunity requires everything to be just right. Too hot or too cold? Things start to break down. Undernutrition has been found to play a role in altering vaccine response for tuberculosis [15], rotavirus [16], measles, and pneumococcus [8]. Obesity also interferes with the ability to mount an effective immune response to vaccination. Obesity also reduces antibody response to hepatitis B and tetanus vaccination. While some associate this reduced response with improper needle length or vaccination technique, it’s also about the antibodies [17]. Compared with healthy-weight adults, vaccinated obese adults are at twice the risk of influenza-like illness or influenza despite equivalent serological response to the influenza vaccination [18].\n\nSometimes, viruses are what you eat\n\nNutritional excess or deficiency both dampen the host immune response and alter cellular metabolism, which creates an advantageous environment for viruses to explore the sequence space and potentially emerge with advantageous mutations [19]. Take obesity. The altered microenvironment associated with obesity supports a more diverse viral quasispecies—a mutant cloud of genomes that collectively infect, replicate, and spread among hosts—potentially evolving pathogenic variants capable of inducing greater transmission or disease severity [20]. On the flip side, nutritional deficiencies also change the genetic composition of viruses. In selenium-deficient and vitamin E-deficient mice, genetic mutations arise in coxsackie B and influenza virus populations, and benign strains become more virulent, even to well-nourished hosts [20].\n\nNutrition is critical for immune response and protection from infection. A significant proportion of people in the world are malnourished, a major concern for infectious disease. COVID-19 has increased malnutrition worldwide, creating conditions that may lead to the next pandemic. “People pack” by Dumitriu Robert, “Coronavirus pack” by Graphic Mall, “Coronavirus icon pack” by SkyClick, and “Coronavirus COVID-19 pack” by Eucalyp Studio are all available at http://www.iconfinder.com under a Creative Commons (Attribution 3.0 Unported) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). “Phosphor Thin Vol.4 pack” by Phosphor Icons is available at https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/phosphor-thin-vol-4 under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1010810.g001\n\nSo, what does this all mean? Nutrition and infection in the “New Normal”\n\nBefore the pandemic, the world was already malnourished. Only 2 out of every 5 people on the planet were considered healthy, and many of those probably had a vitamin deficiency [6]. Despite decades of effort, 820 million people in the world still faced hunger shortages and chronic malnutrition at the end of 2019 [21]. Economic slowdowns and downturns already undermined food security [22]. Then along came a pandemic. Lockdowns, supply chain issues, mass job losses, and political crises exacerbated major socioeconomic challenges and furthered food scarcity and inaccessibility. In all, it is estimated that COVID-19 has threatened access to a healthy diet for nearly 2 billion people [21], 6.7 million of those being children under the age of 5 [23].\n\nAlong with hunger, global obesity had nearly tripled since 1975, with almost 40% of adults being overweight in 2016 [24]. During the pandemic, as some were edging closer to wasting and stunting, others were ballooning further into obesity. Pandemic stress, job loss, decreased access to nutritious foods, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles have exacerbated the obesity epidemic [25]. For children in the United States, rate of body mass index increase nearly doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic [26]. As COVID-19 continues to aggravate malnutrition globally, it feeds the vicious cycle of malnutrition and infection with potentially even greater morbidity and mortality down the road. Furthermore, prophylactics for nutritionally compromised populations continue to remain uncharted territory, as a majority of vaccine seroconversion and effectiveness studies are performed on healthy individuals, a minority of the current global population [11].\n\nSo, even before the pandemic ends, we already need to start considering the next. The majority of critically malnourished people reside in global hotspots of emerging and endemic infectious diseases. Pathogens will continue spilling over. The vicious cycle will continue. Investing in and strengthening public health, pandemic prevention, equal access to healthy food, and good nutritional programs is vital. Even combating climate change is critical for agriculture, disease exposure, and, yes, volcanoes. About 1,500 potentially active volcanoes exist around the world. As our planet warms, these volcanoes are projected to become more active and the cooling effects of their eruptions are expected to increase by 15%, massively increasing repercussions. No one wants another worst year to be alive.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank everyone involved in critical discussions and review of this manuscript in the Virology Unit at Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, including Dr. Veasna Duong, and Dr. Jurre Siegers.\n\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-did-it-robby-mook-michael-sussmann-donald-trump-russia-collusion-alfa-bank-11653084709', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton Did It - WSJ - The Wall Street Journal', 'Snippet': 'The Russia-Trump collusion narrative of 2016 and beyond was a dirty trick for the ages, and now we know it came from the top—candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.', 'Full_text': ''}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60868795', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton over Russian collusion allegations - BBC', 'Snippet': ""Donald Trump's campaign was accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the 2016 election. ...

Moscow denies any involvement.\n\nThe report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out instances where the president possibly obstructed justice.\n\nA decided longshot\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly claimed there was a Democratic conspiracy to undermine his presidency by suggesting his campaign had nefarious ties to Russia. Now he\'s putting his lawyers where his mouth is.\n\nThe lawsuit - against members of the Clinton campaign and senior FBI officials - is a decided longshot, in part because there is ample evidence of connections between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives as documented by Robert Mueller\'s special counsel investigation and a report by the bipartisan Senate intelligence committee.\n\nThe evidence includes the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior campaign staff and Russian nationals and contacts Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had with a suspected Russian intelligence operative. While that did not lead to charges of criminal collaboration between Mr Trump\'s team and Russia, it could undermine Mr Trump\'s allegations that the Clinton team invented the Trump campaign\'s Russia connections out of whole cloth.\n\nA court victory may be unlikely, but Mr Trump can tout the lawsuit itself to his supporters as evidence that he is fighting back against his accusers. And if the case is eventually dismissed, it will be cited as a sign the establishment is still out to get him.\n\nMr Trump\'s legal complaint alleges that ""in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Mrs Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot - one that shocks the conscience and is an affront to this nation\'s democracy.\n\n""Acting in concert, the Defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent, Donald J Trump, was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty.""\n\nThe complaint cites court filings made by special counsel John Durham, a US government attorney appointed by then-President Donald Trump\'s justice department in 2019 to investigate whether the government acted lawfully and appropriately when collecting intelligence ahead of the 2016 presidential election. His investigation is ongoing.\n\nMrs Clinton is yet to comment on the lawsuit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages.

During the Trump administration, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe released some of Brennan’s notes about the intelligence used in his briefing of former President Barack Obama.\n\nRatcliffe publicly said that the intelligence community never corroborated the Russian claims of a “Clinton Plan” to frame Trump, and didn’t know whether it was fabricated.\n\nIn her interview with Durham’s investigators, Clinton expressed sympathy for Durham’s hunt. She calls it, “really sad,” adding, “I get it, you have to go down every rabbit hole.”\n\nBut Durham believes the uncorroborated intelligence should have at least made the FBI question whether it was being used by a political opponent to pursue allegations against the Trump campaign, the report shows.\n\nClinton called the intelligence that was consuming Durham’s time bogus, saying it “looked like Russian disinformation to me.”\n\nA spokesman for Clinton didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday.\n\nDurham concludes that it would be impossible to prosecute anyone for their handling of the intelligence.

In October 2020, Barr appointed Durham as a special counsel on the investigation, but Barr kept that appointment secret until December 2020 to avoid interfering with the 2020 presidential election.\n\nA special counsel is a semi-independent attorney tapped to investigate and potentially prosecute a case when it presents a possible conflict of interest for the Justice Department, or ""where it’s deemed to be in the public interest to have someone outside the government come in and take responsibility for a matter,"" The Associated Press reported.\n\nDurham was set to investigate the origins of the FBI’s Trump campaign investigation, which began in summer 2016, and the investigation by special counsel Robert. S. Mueller that began in 2017.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham, the prosecutor appointed to investigate potential government wrongdoing in the early days of the Trump-Russia probe, leaves federal court in Washington, May 16, 2022. (AP)\n\nDid the Durham report determine that the FBI should have never opened an investigation at all?\n\nDurham’s report suggested that the FBI moved too quickly to open a full investigation, but stopped short of denouncing the FBI’s and Justice Department’s decisions to investigate.\n\nDurham wrote, ""There is no question that the FBI had an affirmative obligation to closely examine"" intelligence provided by the Australian government, which said its diplomats had heard George Papadopoulos, a Trump adviser, make alarming statements related to Russia. Papadopoulos served 12 days in prison for lying about his attempts to allegedly connect other Trump campaign staff with officials representing Russia. He was pardoned by Trump near the end of Trump’s presidency.\n\nDurham wrote that it would have been a ""sensible step"" for the FBI to have opened a more narrowly focused preliminary investigation based on that intelligence — which Durham wrote was ""essentially the sole basis cited by the FBI for opening a full investigation.""\n\nPreliminary investigations, he wrote, are constrained by time limits and fewer approved investigation techniques.\n\nDurham’s report also recommended the FBI take additional steps to reform its investigation process. He proposed making an FBI official responsible for challenging the steps taken in politically sensitive investigations.\n\nResponding to the report, the FBI said the conduct Durham examined was the reason agency leadership implemented corrective actions some time ago, although that time period isn’t specifically defined. If such reforms had been in place in 2016, the agency said, the missteps Durham identified could have been prevented.\n\nDid the Durham report vindicate Trump’s claims that the investigation into his campaign was a baseless ""witch hunt""?\n\nDurham\'s report found that the investigation into Trump\'s campaign was triggered by uncorroborated intelligence that should have been scrutinized more intensely before a full investigation was launched.\n\nBut the report did not conclude that the investigation was entirely baseless and illegitimate.\n\nTrump has long referred to the investigation into potential collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russia as a ""witch hunt"" conducted without evidence. The former president has also often claimed that the collusion allegations were a ""hoax.""\n\nDurham’s report supports the underlying elements of Trump’s sometimes-exaggerated claims. Durham concluded that the FBI moved too quickly to open an investigation based on ""raw, unanalyzed, uncorroborated intelligence."" Durham also wrote that the agency had relied significantly on investigative leads provided or funded by Trump’s political opponents — without adequately questioning the motivations of the people providing the information.\n\nDurham emphasized the need for heightened scrutiny and analysis.\n\nWhen the FBI’s initial investigation was opened, ""neither U.S. law enforcement nor the Intelligence Community appears to have possessed any actual evidence of collusion in their holdings,"" Durham wrote.\n\nThe report concluded that senior FBI officials ""displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor"" toward the information received. Additionally, Durham wrote that ""apparent confirmation bias"" and ""an over-willingness to rely on information from individuals connected to political opponents"" resulted in investigators acting ""without appropriate objectivity or restraint"" when investigating the Trump-Russia collusion allegations.\n\nDurham’s report emphasized the role of confirmation bias in the investigation, rather than political bias. This meant that as the FBI investigated the Trump campaign, the agency ""discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support"" the collusion narrative, Durham wrote.\n\nThe report did, however, outline how the FBI’s response to allegations about the Trump campaign differed from the agency’s response to similar allegations about the Clinton campaign, including:\n\nThe FBI’s decision not to open an inquiry or have analytical personnel investigate ""intelligence it received from a trusted foreign source pointing to a Clinton campaign plan to vilify Trump by tying him to Vladimir Putin"" to divert attention from her own use of a private email server.\n\nProviding defensive briefings for Clinton and her staff when, during her 2016 presidential campaign, it had gathered evidence that foreign operatives were working to gain influence with her campaign. No defensive briefings were provided to the Trump campaign based on the Australian diplomat’s intelligence.\n\nDurham’s report is not the first criticism of the FBI’s investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. A 2019 report by the Justice Department’s inspector general criticized the FBI for ""serious performance failures"" during the investigation. Still, that report concluded that the agency acted without political bias and was justified in opening its investigation.\n\nDid the report clear Trump of ‘all wrongdoing’?\n\nDurham wasn’t tasked with clearing Trump of wrongdoing.\n\nDurham was asked to determine whether the FBI or others violated the law while investigating the Trump campaign.\n\nAfter the report was released, Trump’s allies and supporters claimed on social media that it exonerated Trump and cleared him of ""ALL wrongdoing."" But that wasn’t the purpose of Durham’s investigation. He was investigating the investigators, not Trump’s conduct.\n\nMueller’s investigation, not Durham’s, culminated in a 2019 report that cleared the Trump campaign of allegations that it conspired with Russia ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMueller’s report reaffirmed the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that Russia favored Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it did not find that the Kremlin’s acts on Trump’s behalf or the numerous contacts between the campaign and Russia amounted to criminal conspiracy or illegal coordination.\n\nMueller’s report detailed numerous occasions on which Trump tried to impede that investigation, but Mueller ultimately declined to say whether Trump’s actions obstructed justice. Barr concluded there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Trump for obstruction.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, announced May 15 that he invited Durham to testify at a hearing May 25.\n\nPolitiFact Staff Writer Loreben Tuquero contributed to this report.'}}",92.14285714285714,1

Donald J. Trump is a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States and current president-elect. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels as hush money to buy her silence over a sexual encounter between them; with costs related to the transaction included, the payments totaled $420,000. The Manhattan District Attorney (DA), Alvin Bragg, accused Trump of falsifying these business records with the intent to commit other crimes: violation of federal campaign finance limits, unlawfully influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and tax fraud.[a]\n\nThe indictment, the first of a former U.S. president, was approved by a Manhattan grand jury on March 30, 2023. On April 3, Trump traveled from his residence in Florida to New York City, where he surrendered to the Manhattan DA\'s office and was arraigned the next day. Trump pleaded not guilty and stated that he would continue to campaign for the 2024 presidential election, even if convicted. The trial began on April 15, 2024. On April 30, Trump also became the first U.S. president to be held in criminal contempt of court, due to comments he made earlier in the month about individuals involved with the trial.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Trump\'s 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the payment of hush money to Daniels through Trump\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who was reimbursed via a false retainer agreement. The prosecution rested on May 20, 2024, after calling 20 witnesses. The defense argued that Trump was unaware of any allegedly unlawful scheme, that Cohen was unreliable as a witness, and that the retainer agreement between them was valid. The defense rested on May 21 after calling two witnesses. Throughout proceedings, the defense also made unsuccessful requests for the case to be delayed or dismissed, for the judge to recuse himself, and for a mistrial.\n\nTrump was convicted on all counts on May 30, 2024, becoming the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Following his November 2024 election, the Manhattan DA agreed to postpone sentencing until after his second presidency, and the judge canceled the sentencing hearing. Trump has said he will appeal his conviction but cannot do so until after he is sentenced.\n\nBackground\n\nStormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn July 2006, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known professionally as ""Stormy Daniels"", met Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. At the time, Trump was the host of the reality TV series The Apprentice and was married to Melania Trump.[4] According to Daniels, Trump invited her to his penthouse at Harrah\'s Lake Tahoe[5] where the two had sex and talked about making her a guest on The Apprentice.[6][7]\n\nIn 2011, Daniels considered selling the story to the celebrity magazine Life & Style for US$15,000 as Trump began exploring a potential presidential bid. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened to sue Life & Style when it asked the Trump Organization for comment. Daniels\' agent, Gina Rodriguez, leaked the story to the gossip blog The Dirty in October. The post was taken down following complaints by Trump\'s lawyers, and Daniels disputed the story\'s veracity.[8] Cohen acknowledged during court testimony in May 2024 that he advised for the story\'s removal.[9]\n\nAs Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign began, Rodriguez approached multiple publications—including the National Enquirer—and attempted to sell the story. Following the publication of a controversial recording of Trump and Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, the National Enquirer sought to suppress the story. Rather than paying Daniels, the National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard negotiated a $130,000 non-disclosure agreement between Daniels and Michael Cohen. Cohen attempted to find the money as the election neared and repeatedly delayed her payment. Keith Davidson, Daniels\' lawyer, canceled the deal in October 2016.[5][8]\n\nUltimately, Cohen drew the money from his home equity line of credit and sent it through a shell company incorporated in Delaware.[5][8] Trump initially denied knowing about the check made out to Daniels. In April 2018, aboard Air Force One, he told a reporter he did not know where Cohen got the money.[10] Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post described this statement as a lie,[11] as Trump had personally reimbursed Cohen for the payment.[12][11][13] Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, also refuted Trump\'s claims in a Fox News interview, saying that Trump was aware of the payments.[14]\n\nTrump wrote several checks totaling $420,000 to Cohen. The checks reimbursed him for the non-disclosure agreement and covered the costs for Cohen to manipulate online polls to boost Trump\'s status. The $180,000 paid to Cohen was doubled to offset taxes, and $60,000 was added. These payments were made throughout 2017, during Trump\'s first year of presidency.[15] The payments made to Cohen were declared as a legal expense.[16] Nine monthly checks from Trump to Cohen, dated April to December 2017, exist as evidence.[17]\n\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported on Cohen\'s payment to Daniels.[18] Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts relating to the payment—as well as another payment made to Karen McDougal—in August. In his admission of guilt, Cohen stated that he acted ""at the direction of a candidate for federal office"", implicating Trump.[19][20] In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison.[21]\n\nOn May 2, 2024, The Daily Beast broke a story that Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg had assisted the 2016 campaign with its finance reports.[22]\n\nManhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nFollowing Cohen\'s August 2018 admission of guilt, Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance Jr. opened an investigation against the Trump Organization and two of its executives.[23] The office paused its inquiry when the office of the federal U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York began a separate investigation into the payments,[24] but the federal inquiry concluded without charges in July 2019.[25][b]\n\nThe Manhattan DA\'s office then issued a subpoena for the Trump Organization in August, seeking documents relating to the payments.[27] Additionally, the office subpoenaed accounting firm Mazars USA, demanding eight years of Trump\'s corporate tax returns.[28] Trump\'s lawyers sued Vance to block the subpoena, citing Trump\'s immunity from criminal inquiries as the president of the United States.[29] In Trump v. Vance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7–2 in favor of Vance, allowing the subpoena to continue.[30]\n\nFollowing the 2021 New York County District Attorney election, Alvin Bragg succeeded Vance as the Manhattan DA.[31] In early 2021, Mark Pomerantz, a Manhattan prosecutor, sought to revive the case under the theory that if Daniels had extorted Trump, the money would be criminal proceeds, and efforts to conceal its source would constitute money laundering.[32] On further examination, Pomerantz found that the money laundering statute would not apply, and colleagues were skeptical that the hush money would qualify as extortion.[32] With no path to felony charges, Pomerantz abandoned the inquiry and subsequently resigned in February 2022.[32] In January 2023, the Manhattan DA\'s office impaneled a grand jury, and began presenting evidence of Trump\'s role in the Stormy Daniels payment.[33] Cohen met extensively with the DA\'s office and the grand jury,[34][35][36] and by March 3, Cohen had met with the DA\'s office 18 times[37][38][39] and had given his cellphones to the DA\'s prosecutors, who wanted evidence of communications including voice recordings of Daniels\' former lawyer Keith Davidson.[40] Several other witnesses met with the DA\'s office or the grand jury in March 2023, including Kellyanne Conway,[41] Hope Hicks, two Trump Organization employees, two former National Enquirer executives who helped broker the hush-money deal, a lawyer for Daniels,[42][43] Daniels herself,[44] Trump-aligned lawyer Robert Costello (who provided testimony, including emails, in which he attempted to discredit Cohen\'s reliability),[45][46] and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.[47][48][c] As early as that February, prosecutors confirmed that they might leverage additional charges, including insurance fraud, against Allen Weisselberg to pressure him to testify against Trump,[51] and in May, The New York Times reported that they were considering perjury charges against him.[52]\n\nIn March 2023, District Attorney Alvin Bragg\'s office indicated that an indictment was likely.[53] By March 9, 2023, prosecutors had offered Trump a chance to testify before the grand jury the following week, indicating that they were likely preparing to indict him.[54][55] Around that time, Trump and his spokesperson began referring to both Daniels\' allegation and the DA\'s proceedings as ""extortion"".[56] On March 10, 2023, Trump\'s lawyer Joe Tacopina asked New York City\'s Department of Investigation to review the criminal probe, asserting its ""weaponization"".[57] On March 13, Tacopina announced that Trump would not testify.[58] Early the next morning, The Guardian reported that Trump\'s lawyers had argued to the DA that Trump should not be indicted on the basis that the payment did not draw from campaign funds and would have been made regardless of his candidacy.[59]\n\nIn late March 2023, there was reporting around Daniels having reportedly unsuccessfully communicated in 2018 with Tacopina about possibly representing her in the scandal, for which the DA could move to disqualify the lawyer due to attorney–client privilege and because she reputedly disclosed confidential information to his firm.[60][61][62][63] Additionally, it reemerged that, in 2018, Tacopina had called the hush-money payment ""an illegal agreement"", ""a fraud"", and ""a potential campaign finance issue"".[60]\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Trump claimed on his social-media platform, Truth Social, that he was to be arrested on March 21[d][e] and that the proceedings were disinformation backed by President Joe Biden, calling for protests in anticipation of a possible indictment.[66][67][68][69][70] Law enforcement and security agencies prepared for potential reactions to an indictment of Trump that week, especially in the areas of the Manhattan Criminal Court and Trump Tower, including by monitoring online threats.[69][71][72][f] New York City Police began to increase security in preparation for the expected indictment on March 21, and a second time for the second expected indictment on March 30.[74] Metal barriers were set up around Trump Tower and the district Criminal Court Building.[75] On March 24, Trump, citing his presidential prospects, insinuated that ""potential death & destruction"" could result from Bragg\'s allegedly false charge.[76][g]\n\nTrump has called the investigation a ""witch hunt"", claiming political persecution.[81] Trump proponents have referred to the case as harassment, calling it a ""political hack job"".[82] The trial and accompanying political theatrics have been described as a ""circus"" by the media.[83][84][85] Due to multiple investigation revivals, the case earned the moniker of ""zombie case"".[32][86]\n\nEligibility for president\n\nThe Article II of the U.S. Constitution does not have any rules blocking presidential candidates with criminal records.[87] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier in Trump v. Anderson that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking the prohibition in section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which states ""no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US"".[88]\n\nInitial proceedings\n\nIndictment and charges\n\nThe Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on March 30, 2023.[89] The indictment was filed with the New York Supreme Court (the ordinary trial court for felonies in the state of New York and not the final court of appeal for the state) the same day.[90] The charges were under seal until published when Trump was arraigned.[91][92]\n\nThe indictment charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law §175.10.[93][94] Each count is related to a specific business document, each having a date ranging from February 14 through December 5, 2017:[95]\n\n11 for invoices from Michael Cohen\n\n9 for general ledger entries for Donald J. Trump\n\n9 for checks from Donald J. Trump\n\n3 for general ledger entries for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\n2 for checks from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\nThe allegedly falsified documents are related to Trump\'s payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money. The payments were listed in the business records as a legal expense payable to Michael Cohen, whereas the indictment alleges that they were actually to reimburse Cohen for the earlier, allegedly illicit, payment to Daniels.[96][97]\n\nFalsifying business records in the first degree is a felony under New York state law that requires that the ""intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof"". This is in contrast to falsifying business records in the second degree, which is a misdemeanor that does not have that requirement.[95][96][97] The charges neither include, nor even identify, the additional crimes, constituting a relatively unusual strategy for the DA:[98][95]\n\nA New York Times analysis of about 30 false business records cases brought by Mr. Bragg and his predecessor — based on court records, interviews and information the office provided — shows that in this respect, the case against Mr. Trump stands apart. In all but two of the indictments reviewed by The Times, the defendant was charged with an additional crime on top of the false records charge.\n\nIn later filings, Bragg listed (but still did not charge) three general types of crime that Trump allegedly intended to commit: violation of federal campaign finance limits, violation of state election laws by unlawfully influencing the 2016 election, and violation of state tax laws regarding the reimbursement.[99] Trump could have moved to allow the jury to convict on the misdemeanor charges as a lesser included offense, but he did not.[100][101]\n\nEach count for which Trump was convicted could result in a prison sentence of up to four years, to be served consecutively, with a maximum sentence of 20 years.[102][95][103][104] He is permitted to assume the presidency even should he be in prison.[105] The judge may also choose to impose no prison sentence.[106]\n\nThe conviction did not legally prohibit Trump from continuing his campaign in the 2024 presidential election, which he won.[105] (Trump had stated in an April 2023 Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson that he would continue his candidacy even if convicted.)[107][108]\n\nArraignment\n\nTrump was arraigned on April 4, 2023. A law enforcement source told Reuters that police would close streets around the courthouse in advance of Trump\'s expected appearance.[109] On April 3, Trump flew from Palm Beach International Airport into LaGuardia Airport on his private plane, and took his motorcade to Trump Tower, where he stayed the night.[110][111] Todd Blanche, a lawyer who had defended Paul Manafort during his 2016 fraud trial, had recently resigned from his law firm to aid Trump\'s case.[112] Police increased security in and around Manhattan ahead of the arraignment; authorities said there were no credible threats of violence or organized plans of protests.[111] Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, warned protestors to be peaceful.[113] Acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is presiding over the case.[114] Merchan denied a motion filed by media organizations to allow a television broadcast of the arraignment or to allow electronic devices to be used in the courtroom, but allowed five press pool still photographers.[115][116] Courtroom sketch artists also documented the proceedings.[117] The courtroom\'s glass doors were covered as a security measure.[118]\n\nUpon entering the courthouse, he was put in police custody and placed under arrest.[119][120] He was booked and fingerprinted, but he was not handcuffed, nor was a mug shot taken.[121][122] Trump entered the courtroom an hour later,[123] pleading not guilty to 34 felony charges.[124] The indictment was unsealed (publicly released) shortly thereafter, charging Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree as part of a ""conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election"".[125][126] This marked the first indictment of a former U.S. president.[127][128][129] At the arraignment, Merchan warned Trump not to use social media to incite violence.[130]\n\nPossible trial dates were discussed; prosecutors proposed January 2024, but Trump\'s defense team objected, saying that the trial should be set for later in 2024.[131]\n\nImmediately after the arraignment, Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago and addressed a crowd of supporters in the evening.[132][110] Trump made several false claims about topics such as his handling of government documents, District Attorney Bragg, and the Trump–Raffensperger phone call.[133]\n\nPre-trial proceedings\n\nDuring Trump\'s arraignment, the court set deadlines for pre-trial proceedings, including for prosecutors to provide discovery to the defense.[131] The court set a deadline of August 8, 2023, for pre-trial motions to be filed.[131]\n\nAs he had done in other cases, Trump used ""attack-and-delay"" tactics, targeting the prosecutors and the judge while prolonging proceedings, with the aim that the case might continue into late 2024, near the presidential election.[134][135]\n\nTrump\'s lawyers maintained that he was unaware of any allegedly unlawful schemes that his allies or associates may have engaged in.[136] On March 12, 2024, the defense team filed their strategy writing ""President Trump lacked the requisite intent to commit the conduct charged in the Indictment because of his awareness that various lawyers were involved in the underlying conduct giving rise to the charges.""[137] The defense counsel stated that they would not invoke the formal ""advice of counsel"" defense, but that Trump would ""elicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges"".[137][138][h]\n\nRequest for indictment dismissal\n\nOn September 29, 2023, Trump\'s team submitted omnibus motions to dismiss the indictment and requesting clarification of the charges.[140]\n\nOn April 27, Trump\'s team had asked for the charges to be explained in full.[141] It was possible that the second crime(s) would eventually be specified in a bill of particulars,[142] but according to a governing appeals case from c. 1980 this is not necessary.[143] On May 16, the DA\'s office argued that it did not need to elaborate further on the basis that Trump already ""has more than sufficient information to prepare his defense"", while reiterating possible secondary charges.[144][145][i] Trump\'s team was reportedly considering invoking a 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision which emphasizes the importance of specifying punishable criminal charges; additionally, a 1999 decision states that ""any fact ... that increases the maximum penalty for [one] crime must be charged in an indictment ... and proved"".[141]\n\nOn February 15, 2024, the court denied the motions to dismiss.[146][147][148] However, the court did partially grant Trump\'s request seeking clarification of the charges. Trump is not only accused of falsifying business records, but doing so with the intention to commit or conceal some other crime. Holding it would be unfair to expect Trump to prepare a defense to a newly raised theory mid-trial, the court limited the prosecution to just three theories of ""other crimes"" that had already been identified during pre-trial procedure.[146][149]\n\nDiscovery materials and witnesses\n\nAs of Trump\'s arraignment on April 4, 2023, it was expected that the discovery process would take several months.[150]\n\nOn April 17, 2023, the DA\'s office requested that Merchan obtain further information from Tacopina, including his firm\'s correspondence with Daniels, to determine whether their history constituted a conflict of interest.[63] On September 1, Merchan ruled that it did not.[151]\n\nOn May 4, Merchan heard arguments about the DA office\'s request to restrict information it turns over to Trump\'s lawyers from being shared with Trump himself (at least until the trial), citing his past social-media posts attacking Bragg and witnesses. The defense has argued that the government should be equally restrained from discussing information publicly and that Trump should be allowed to defend himself politically.[152][153] On May 8, Merchan ruled in favor of the order, barring evidence from being shared on social media.[154] The judge instructed Trump and his lawyers on their conduct on May 23, informing them that violations could incur a ""wide range of sanctions"" including being held in contempt of court.[155]\n\nOn May 26, prosecutors stated that they had informed Trump\'s lawyers that evidence in the hush-money case includes various audio recordings, including one of Trump and a witness. It was unclear if this was in reference to secretly recorded audio from September 2016 which Cohen had previously released.[156][157][158][159]\n\nOn August 3, federal judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversaw E. Jean Carroll\'s civil lawsuits against Trump alleging sexual assault and defamation,[j] ruled that Carroll\'s lawyers could provide video of Trump being deposed to Manhattan prosecutors.[162]\n\nOn January 15, 2024, Tacopina withdrew from Trump\'s counsel[163] and Daniels said she expected to testify.[164] Later in the month, the DA was reportedly beginning to meet with witnesses ahead of the trial.[165]\n\nOn March 18, the judge ruled that both Daniels and Cohen could testify, placing some restrictions on Daniels (as well as Karen McDougal). The defense had requested that the two be blocked from testifying the previous month. Additionally, the judge ruled that Trump\'s Access Hollywood tape could not be played during the trial but that it could be discussed.[166]\n\nOn April 22, Merchan ruled on what prosecutors may ask Trump if he testified,[167] following a pretrial Sandoval hearing held on April 19.[168][169][170]\n\nOn May 10, Judge Juan Merchan suggested that Allen Weisselberg could be called to testify in court after the defense objected to the prosecution\'s plan to show the jury a $750,000 severance agreement.[171] Neither the defense nor the prosecution had subpoenaed Weisselberg, and there were procedural concerns about adding him to the witness list so late in the trial.[171] Furthermore, Weisselberg\'s testimony could be in violation of the non-disparagement clause of his severance agreement and he would likely invoke the fifth amendment.[172][173]\n\nRequests for recusal\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, who has experience with financial cases,[174] was randomly assigned to oversee the grand jury proceedings in Trump\'s case, and continued to oversee handling of the charges approved by the grand jury.[175]\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers filed a motion asking Judge Merchan to recuse himself from the case citing his daughter\'s position as partner and COO of Authentic Campaigns, a consulting firm that serviced Biden\'s 2020 presidential campaign. The motion additionally alleged that Merchan had encouraged former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg to cooperate with the prosecution against Trump in a previous case he had presided over, and that Merchan had made three $10–15 donations to various Democratic causes.[176][177][k] On June 20, the DA\'s office argued against the recusal request, citing Trump\'s alleged ""prolific history of baselessly accusing state and federal judges around the country of bias"", saying he seemed to be trying to land a more favorable judge. Prosecutors further argued that there was a lack of hard evidence that a particular trial result would aid Merchan directly or greatly via his daughter\'s Democratic work,[180] which a state ethics panel had similarly concluded in early May.[181][l] The court denied the motion on August 11, 2023.[185]\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the defense asked Merchan for permission to file a motion repeating their prior request that he recuse himself for what the defense said was a conflict of interest due to his daughter\'s Democratic involvement.[186] On April 1, the New York City Bar Association issued a statement of ""unequivocal support"" for Merchan\'s handling of the recusal concerns.[m] On April 2, prosecutors pointed out that the court and an ethics panel had already found that the political activities of a relative are not grounds for questioning a judge\'s impartiality.[188][n]\n\nThe same day, Trump posted a Fox & Friends clip in which co-host Brian Kilmeade criticized the judge\'s daughter, although Trump highlighted another commentator\'s statement.[191] As of April 3, Trump had not deleted offending posts made prior to Merchan\'s expanded order;[192] that night, he linked to a report by far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Merchan\'s daughter and wife.[193] On April 5, Trump\'s campaign publicized their motion for Merchan to recuse himself (dated April 3),[188] which asserts numerous counts of bias, and falsely cites the state Office of Court Administration (OCA) as saying Merchan\'s daughter deleted her X account in April 2023, around when the judge ""solicited an ethics opinion regarding recusal in a letter ... that the Court declined to disclose"".[194][181][195][o][p]\n\nOn April 6, Trump posted online that if arrested for violating the gag order, he would consider it a ""great honor"" to ""become a Modern Day Nelson Mandela"", the former South African president jailed for anti-apartheid activism.[201] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked an appeals court to delay the trial and pause the gag order while they appeal the latter; this was denied the following day.[202][203] On April 10, an appeals judge denied another defense delay request which was based on Merchan having not yet ruled on the recusal motion.[204][202] On April 15, Merchan denied the recusal motion.[205] On April 30, an appellate court denied requests for both a recusal and a stay of proceedings.[206]\n\nRequest for removal to federal court\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers asked for the case to be moved to a federal court (though it would remain a state-law prosecution conducted by the Manhattan DA), arguing that it involved alleged conduct somehow ""performed while in office""—despite the potential federal election-law violations not being specified and occurring prior to Trump\'s inauguration.[153][145][q] As proceedings continued in the New York Supreme Court,[207] Bragg asked for the removal request to be dismissed, arguing that Trump had failed to establish that he was an officer of the United States during his presidency,[208][209] to which the defense expounded its initial argument.[210][153] Even if the case had been moved to federal court, New York state law would have continued to apply.[211]\n\nIn a hearing on June 27, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein opined that Trump\'s conduct likely did not constitute presidential activity.[212] On July 19, arguing that the matter was apparently a personal ""cover-up of an embarrassing event"", Hellerstein ruled that the case should remain in state court.[213] Trump appealed the decision on July 28,[214] but withdrew this on November 14.[215]\n\nTrial scheduling\n\nOn May 23, 2023, Justice Merchan set the trial for March 25, 2024.[216] Trump\'s team complained that he expected to have multiple trials around that time. Merchan said he would discuss rescheduling to another time.[217] At a February 15, 2024, hearing, which Trump attended,[218] Merchan reaffirmed the March 25 trial date.[219]\n\nIn early February 2024, Trump\'s federal election obstruction trial, originally set for early March, was postponed pending appeals, increasing the likelihood of the Manhattan criminal trial taking place as planned on March 25, 2024.[220][221]\n\nOn March 11, 2024, Trump\'s lawyers requested a delay of trial until after the federal election obstruction case on the basis that it would bolster his argument of presidential immunity, as some evidence and allegedly some acts overlapped with his time in office.[222] Trump\'s team cited, from April 2018, Trump\'s denying knowledge of the hush-money payment to reporters and tweeting in defense of Cohen\'s credibility.[223] Later on March 11, Merchan pointed out that Trump\'s team had missed the filing deadline and said either party would need his permission to file additional pretrial motions.[222] On March 3, the judge dismissed the request as untimely.[224]\n\nAlso on March 11, Trump asked to delay trial until after the Supreme Court decides whether he is generally immune from prosecution in the federal charges on election obstruction. Granting the motion would have delayed trial until mid-summer or later, as the Supreme Court had already scheduled those arguments for April 25[225] and may not rule until the end of the court\'s term in early July.[226] Merchan denied the motion on April 3,[227] saying that he doubted its ""sincerity and actual purpose"", given that Trump made this request only two weeks before trial.[228]\n\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office provided prosecutors with approximately 170,000 pages of documents, largely related to the 2017 federal probe of Cohen\'s payment to Daniels (and mostly reflecting evidence already turned over to Trump\'s lawyers in June 2023).[229][230][231] Trump\'s lawyers sought a delay in the trial on the basis of the newly produced records; the DA\'s office said in court that only 300 of the documents were relevant to Trump\'s defense.[232] On March 15, 2024, the judge delayed the start of trial until mid-April.[233] On March 25, 2024, the judge set a trial date of April 15, and denied a motion by Trump\'s team to further delay the trial.[232] On May 23, 2024, Merchan denied Trump\'s request to sanction prosecutors regarding the document release, ruling that the defense was provided sufficient time to respond.[234]\n\nOn March 18, Trump\'s team requested an additional delay on the basis that pretrial publicity and apparent anti-Trump bias in Manhattan would prohibit a fair jury from being selected in April, although only 35% in the cited poll said they were convinced Trump was guilty in the DA\'s case specifically. Trump\'s lawyers cited berating statements by Cohen, e.g. saying he served jail time because his ""lying"" former boss ""couldn\'t keep his mushroom dick in his pants"". On March 25, the assistant DA countered that ""publicity is not likely to abate [and] the pretrial publicity has been ... exacerbated by the defendant"".[235] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked the appeals court for a delay to allow an attempt to move the trial to a different county, which was denied the same day.[202]\n\nOn April 8, Trump requested to postpone the trial so the court could consider a change of venue, which was denied the same day,[236] and so he could appeal the gag order, which was denied the next day.[237] On April 10, the appeals court denied Trump\'s request to postpone trial on the basis of Merchan being unqualified.[238] On April 12, Merchan denied the defendant\'s request to delay trial on the basis of ""prejudicial"" media coverage.[239] On April 15, Merchan said Trump was ""required to be here"" on April 25 and ""not required to be at the Supreme Court"" that day, when it would hear arguments on his immunity claim in the federal election case.[240] Merchan said he was not yet prepared to say whether trial would be held on May 17 to allow Trump to attend his son Barron\'s high-school graduation, but indicated that he probably would grant him the day off if the proceedings progressed at an expected pace.[241] Trump subsequently complained that he would ""not be allowed"" to attend the graduation, but on April 30 the judge said he would be able to do so.[242] On May 17, Donald and Melania Trump attended their son\'s graduation from Oxbridge Academy at West Palm Beach, followed by a visit to Lincoln Reagan Dinner at the 2024 annual Minnesota Republican convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[243]\n\nGag order\n\nIn a May 2023 hearing and court filing, prosecutors expressed concern that Trump would misuse evidence obtained through pretrial discovery procedure to attack people involved in the case, including witnesses.[211] Justice Merchan declined to issue a gag order or prohibit Trump from publicly commenting about the case against him,[211] but issued a protective order setting rules for the use of social media involving elements of the case, and set a hearing (with Trump to appear remotely) to explain the rules.[244][245]\n\nAt Trump\'s arraignment, on April 4, 2023, Merchan instructed Blanche to ""speak to your client and anybody else you need to, and remind them to please refrain, please refrain from making statements that are likely to incite violence or civil unrest. Please refrain from making comments or engaging in conduct that has the potential to incite violence, create civil unrest, or jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals.""[246] Blanche had stated that Trump was ""frustrated, upset, and believes that there is a grave injustice happening with him being in this courtroom today"" which Merchan rebuked ""I don\'t share your view that certain language and certain rhetoric is just by frustration.""[246] Merchan did not seek to impose a gag order at the time.[247]\n\nOn February 26, 2024, the Manhattan DA asked for a gag order on Trump, noting that Trump has been fined $15,000 for two violations of a gag order in the civil fraud trial by disparaging the judge\'s law clerk on social media, and reporting that police had logged 89 threats to Bragg, his family, or staff in 2023 (as opposed to a single threat in 2022).[248] On March 7, Merchan ruled that the jury would be anonymous except to some involved in the trial, including Trump, his lawyers, and prosecutors.[249] On March 26, Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump, restricting what he could say publicly about people involved in the case.[250] Additionally, the judge warned the defense, under the threat of contempt, against dilatory tactics such as the late filing of pretrial motions or last-minute demands, pointing out that Trump had ""stated publicly that the defense goal is to delay these proceedings ... past the 2024 presidential election"".[251][252] On March 26, Trump made online posts attacking the judge, the gag order, and Merchan\'s daughter, the latter over an anti-Trump social-media post created by someone impersonating her on social media.[253][254][255] The same day, Merchan imposed a gag order forbidding Trump to publicly comment on court staff, prosecutors, prospective jurors, or their families, or to cause others to make such statements, in a way that interferes with the case. Bragg (as a public figure) and Merchan (as the judge) were specifically exempted from protection.[256][257] The court also ordered Trump not to comment on prospective trial witnesses concerning their potential participation in the criminal case.[258]\n\nOn March 27 and 28, Trump again attacked Merchan\'s daughter on social media.[257][259] On March 29, prosecutors requested that the limits of the gag order be explicated regarding family of court staff in hopes of terminating what they considered intentionally defiant behavior by Trump.[254][260] On April 1, Merchan expanded the gag order to protect his and Bragg\'s family members, saying attacks on them ""serve no legitimate purpose"".[261][262] He wrote that Trump\'s continued attacks posted a ""very real"" threat to the integrity of proceedings and could cause those involved in the case to fear for themselves and their families, which would ""undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself"".[263] On April 11, Trump disparaged expected witnesses Cohen and Daniels on social media, referring to them as dishonest ""sleaze bags"".[258] On May 6, Merchan found Trump in contempt of court for the tenth time, but stated that he did not wish to jail Trump due to the fact that Trump was a former and potentially the next president.[264]\n\nContempt hearings were later held concerning numerous alleged violations of the gag order. On May 14, a New York appeals court denied Trump\'s request to overturn the order.[265]\n\nAlso on May 14, United States Senator Tommy Tuberville called the gag order ""ridiculous"" for stopping Trump ""from having a say-so in his own trial""; Tuberville further said that members of Congress were attending the trial ""to speak our piece for President Trump"" and ""overcome this gag order"", and he hoped that ""more and more"" members of Congress would do so.[266] Republican members of Congress, including Tuberville, JD Vance, Cory Mills, Nicole Malliotakis and Speaker Mike Johnson, have criticized witness Michael Cohen, while Byron Donalds, Rick Scott, Vance, and Johnson have criticized Merchan\'s daughter.[267][268][269][270] New York magazine journalist Andrew Rice claimed that during Cohen\'s May 13 testimony, he saw Trump penning revision notes as to statements about the case from his Republican allies.[271] On May 14, Trump commented that ""I do have a lot of surrogates, and they\'re speaking very beautifully.""[272]\n\nOn May 20, speaking outside the courtroom, Trump mentioned witnesses Robert Costello and Michael Cohen.[273]\n\nOn June 25, Merchan lifted parts of Trump\'s gag order, allowing him to talk about the jury and witnesses who took the stand during the trial.[274] Merchan also stated that the gag order would be completely lifted following sentencing.[275]\n\nStatute of limitations\n\nIn New York, the statute of limitations is typically two years for misdemeanors and five years for felonies.[276] Though falsifying business records is typically a misdemeanor, in New York, the charges are upgraded to a felony when used to commit or conceal another crime.[276] Trump was charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, which is a Class E felony (the least severe), whose statute of limitations is five years.[276] On March 20, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued Executive Order No. 202.8 tolling (pausing) the statute of limitations for ""any specific time limit for the commencement, filing, or service of any legal action, notice, motion, or other process or proceeding, as prescribed by the procedural laws of the state"".[276]\n\nMerchan ruled the tolling deadline was through May 6, 2021, thus extending the deadline for the prosecution by one year and 47 days, allowing the felony prosecution to commence within 6 years and 47 days from when the crime was committed.[276] Trump\'s first indictment occurred on February 14, 2017, and the indictment was filed on March 3, 2023, within days of the deadline.[276] On February 14, 2024, Merchan ruled that the tolled period was sufficient.[276]\n\nThe New York statute of limitations provision, CPL§30.10, permits tolling of up to five years while the defendant is continuously outside the state.[276] During his presidency, Trump spent the majority of his time outside New York.[276] Merchan declined to address where this provision was applicable as the tolling occasioned by the Governor\'s Executive Order was sufficient.[277]\n\nOverview of witnesses\n\nProsecution witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Witness Date Function David Pecker April 22 Publisher of National Enquirer April 23 April 25 April 26 Rhona Graff April 26 Donald Trump executive assistant April 30 Gary Farro April 30 First Republic banker Robert Browning April 30 C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Phillip Thompson April 30 Regional Director of Esquire Deposition Solutions Keith Davidson April 30 Former attorney for Stormy Daniels May 2 Douglas Daus May 2 Computer forensics specialist in the Manhattan DA\'s office Hope Hicks May 3 Former White House Communications Director Jeffrey McConney May 6 Former Trump Organization comptroller Deborah Tarasoff May 6 Trump Organization accounting employee Sally Franklin May 7 Penguin Books executive Stormy Daniels May 7 Hush money recipient May 9 Rebecca Manochio May 9 Trump Organization bookkeeper Tracey Menzies May 9 Senior vice president at HarperCollins Madeleine Westerhout May 9 Former Director of Oval Office Operations May 10 Jennie Tomalin May 10 Verizon senior analyst Daniel Dixon May 10 AT&T compliance analyst Jaden Jarmel-Schneider May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Georgia Longstreet May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Michael Cohen May 13 Hush money intermediary May 14 May 16 May 20\n\nDefense witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Date Witness Function Daniel Sitko May 20 Paralegal for defense attorney Robert Costello May 20 Associate of Michael Cohen May 21\n\nTrial\n\nThe trial began on April 15, 2024, with recessed Wednesdays.[278] Trump was required to attend every day of trial barring a court-approved absence.[279] If he chose to testify, prosecutors could have asked him about his civil lawsuits regarding business fraud, sexual abuse, and defamation as well as the 2018 dissolution of his charitable foundation.[280] Attorneys Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles represented him.[281]\n\nThe trial was not televised.[282] Initially, Merchan allowed photographers to stand at the front of the room for a few minutes each morning before the trial began to take photos of Trump seated. Merchan withdrew this permission on May 9 after at least one photo was taken from the side of the table.[283] There are courtroom sketch artists present to capture the milieu.[284][r]\n\nThe temperature in the trial courtroom was a point of contention, with Trump repeatedly complaining that it was too cold, akin to an icebox, possibly intentionally.[289][290][291] Judge Juan Merchan acknowledged that the courtroom was chilly, but has stated that he would rather it be a little cold than too hot, and that climate control is limited in the 80-year-old building.[292][291] Despite Trump\'s complaints, reporters in the courtroom noted that the temperature was not as cold as he claims.[293]\n\nJury selection and opening statements\n\nOn April 8, 2024, the judge gave attorneys a copy of the jury selection questionnaire,[294] with jury selection beginning on April 15[295][296] from a pool of over 500 candidates.[297]\n\nOver the first two days, 96 potential jurors appeared, of which more than half were immediately dismissed after indicating that they could not be impartial. Nine jurors provisionally qualified on the first day, and an additional ten on the second;[298][299][300] from these 19, seven jurors were selected and sworn in.[s]\n\nHowever, two were excused on April 18, one of whom complaining that her friends and family had recognized her from details published in the news.[300][303][304] Trump was reprimanded by the judge on April 16 for gesturing and audibly speaking in the direction of a potential juror.[305][306]\n\nAnother group of 96 potential jurors was brought in later in the week.[304] Twelve jurors, along with one alternate, were selected by April 18.[307] The selection of six alternate jurors concluded on April 19.[308][309] The jury reportedly comprised seven men and five women, who mostly had white-collar careers.[310] The jurors were allowed to tell their family and employers that they were on the jury but could not discuss the case with them.[311]\n\nTrump was described as falling asleep for brief intervals on four out of the first five days of the trial, ahead of opening statements,[312][313][314][315][316] and as being flatulent.[t] Trump has denied dozing off at his trial.[u]\n\nOn April 22, opening statements began.[328] Prosecutors accused Trump, Cohen, and Pecker of campaign finance violations, alleging they coordinated payments to two women and concealed them as part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.[329] During their opening statements, prosecutors said the jury would be presented with a document with a handwritten note in the margin by Allen Weisselberg outlining the hush-money payment scheme.[330][331]\n\nThe defense argued that the testimony of Cohen, a convicted felon, could not be trusted; that the payments were ordinary business transactions, akin to editorial decisions made by newspapers;[332] and that in democracies it is normal for candidates to attempt to influence an election.[329]\n\nContempt hearings\n\nOn April 15, prosecutors asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for three alleged violations of the gag order against him;[307] prosecutors also requested to use the attacks on Cohen as evidence.[298][258][333] By the morning of April 18, prosecutors alleged that Trump incurred seven further violations of the order and requested that he be fined another $7,000.[307]\n\nOn April 23, Merchan heard arguments about whether Trump had violated the earlier gag order when he made social-media posts about two expected witnesses.[334] Merchan criticized Trump\'s attorney Todd Blanche for failing to justify Trump\'s claim that he was merely responding to ""political attacks"" and for failing to provide any legal precedent supporting Trump\'s claim that reposting an article could not be a violation of a gag order; Merchan told Blanche, ""You\'re losing credibility.""[334][335] Merchan rejected Trump\'s position that reposting a news article to social media was a merely ""passive"" rather than active act.[336][v] The defense also declared that ""Trump absolutely knows what the gag order allows him to do and does not allow him to do.""[336]\n\nOn April 30, Trump became the first U.S. president ever to be held in criminal contempt of court, under NY Judiciary Law Section 750(3).[337] (Trump had previously been held in civil contempt, for withholding documents, in the New York business fraud case.)[338] Trump was found in contempt on nine of the ten counts, regarding statements made from April 10–17.[339] Over the next few days, he paid a $9,000 fine.[340][341][342] Merchan said he would consider jailing Trump for further violations ""if necessary and appropriate"".[343]\n\nOn May 2, a second hearing was held to consider four further violation claims.[w] The prosecution said it was ""not yet seeking jail"".[348][349] On May 6, Trump was found in contempt for one of those four claims (when he on April 22 commented on the jury) and was fined $1,000.[x] The judge again warned Trump of possible incarceration for further violations.[352]\n\nThe mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, said that corrections officials would be ""ready"" if the judge ordered incarceration.[353]\n\nProsecution witnesses\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nProsecutors called former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker to testify on April 22, 23, 25 and 26 as the trial\'s first witness, taking most of the first week of testimony.[354] He had been given immunity in 2018 in a federal investigation into Michael Cohen in exchange for information regarding hush money deals.[355] During Pecker\'s testimony, it was implied that former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, who Pecker stated was now living in Australia and suffering from a ""spinal condition"", would not testify.[354][356] It was previously reported that while Pecker and his company American Media Inc. (AMI), the National Enquirer\'s parent company, facilitated payment to McDougal,[357] Pecker refused to personally do the same with Daniels,[358][359] though he allegedly alerted Trump associates about Daniels\' decision to go public with her affair allegation.[360] On April 23, Pecker testified that Cohen used to feed him negative stories about Trump\'s enemies, which Pecker\'s staff would then ""embellish"" and show drafts to Cohen to get his feedback before publishing them.[361] Pecker also detailed how he offered to deploy the ""catch and kill"" scheme, stating that he offered in 2015 to suppress negative stories about Trump and flag efforts by women attempting to sell stories about him.[362] The prosecution cited a state election law regarding conspiracy to defend their questioning of Pecker about his contacts with Steve Bannon, the chief executive officer of Trump\'s 2016 campaign.[363]\n\nOn April 25, Pecker testified that AMI suppressed negative press about other celebrities, which was emphasized by Trump\'s team in their cross-examination.[364] Additionally, he stated that he did not believe Cohen was working for Trump\'s campaign.[365] Pecker discussed his relationship with Trump prior to the 2016 campaign, during which he suppressed other negative stories about him. Pecker detailed how his company, Trump and Cohen facilitated payment to McDougal in mid-2016, in tandem with promising her a ghostwritten monthly column in an attempt to disguise the contract\'s true nature.[364][282][366] In September 2016, Cohen asked to purchase the boxes of McDougal\'s source material (valued by Pecker at $25,000) on Trump\'s behalf. Pecker then told Cohen that he did not want to be reimbursed for the payment to McDougal. According to Pecker, an AMI staff member leaked details of the scheme on November 4, 2016, ahead of the election, after which Pecker released a false statement that AMI had never paid anyone to kill damaging stories about Trump. AMI then amended its contract with McDougal allowing her to speak to the press.[366] Pecker also described a January 2017 meeting in Trump Tower in which Trump thanked Pecker for his work regarding McDougal and another story.[366][367][y] Pecker said his decision not to facilitate payment to Daniels (because she was a porn star) led to it being done by Cohen.[364] Pecker testified he acted at Trump\'s behest and intended to help him win the presidency, despite his own doubts regarding campaign-finance laws.[366][368] Additionally, Pecker said that after receiving a letter from the Federal Election Commission about possible campaign violations in mid-2021, he signed a non-prosecution deal with federal prosecutors for his cooperation.[366]\n\nGraff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson\n\nFour witnesses testified over the latter part of April 26 through the earlier part of April 30.\n\nOn April 26, Trump\'s executive assistant Rhona Graff testified that when she worked outside Trump\'s office in Trump Tower, she maintained contact information for McDougal and Daniels,[369] and that she had a ""vague recollection"" of glimpsing Daniels at a Trump Tower reception area.[370] During her cross-examination by the defense, Graff said Trump was sometimes prone to multitasking while signing checks, depending ""what was going on ... and how important the checks were"".[17][371]\n\nAdditional testimony was also provided by former First Republic banker Gary Farro on April 26 and 30. He testified that on October 26, 2016, he helped Cohen open an account for a real-estate limited liability company. According to prosecutors, the same day, Cohen deposited $131,000 from his personal home-equity credit line, and the next day transferred $130,000 to Daniels\' lawyer, Keith Davidson.[370][372][373] He detailed how he assisted in setting up the bank account which enabled Cohen to make the hush money payment. Farro stated that Cohen was eager to connect with him, and would set up the account in October 2016. Farro also noted that the account was set up for Essential Consultants LLC, the company the payment was made from, and that it was funded through Cohen\'s home-equity line of credit at First Republic.[373][374] According to Farro, Cohen did not want addresses on the checks.[373] Prosecution also presented evidence showing emails to and from Cohen, which confirmed the $131,000 deposit to a checking account 20 minutes after it was opened.[374] In texts between Davidson and Cohen, Davidson provided wiring instructions for the $130,000 hush-money payment. According to Farro, First Republic closed Cohen\'s accounts after the payment to Daniels became public.[375]\n\nApril 30 also saw testimony from C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Robert Browning, who verified the authenticity of C-SPAN videos of Trump, as well as Phillip Thompson, a regional director of Esquire Deposition Solutions, which provided court reporter services for Trump\'s October 2022 deposition in one of the E. Jean Carroll defamation cases.[376][377]\n\nOn May 20, the prosecution tried to contact Browning to see if he would be available to testify again, this time regarding a photograph of Trump with his former bodyguard Keith Schiller.[378][379]\n\nKeith Davidson and Douglas Daus\n\nSee also: Keith Davidson § Stormy Daniels\n\nKeith Davidson, a former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, appeared on April 30 and May 2. He testified that the Access Hollywood tape helped influence Daniels to go forward with her story.[380] According to Davidson\'s testimony, he drafted the $130,000 hush-money agreement, in which he used the pseudonyms ""Peggy Peterson"" for Daniels and ""David Dennison"" for Trump.[381] The agreement called for payment by October 14, 2016. When the payment did not arrive, Davidson communicated with Cohen,[382] who told him that Trump was traveling.[383] On October 17, Davidson wrote to Cohen that the agreement was void and furthermore that he would no longer be representing Daniels.[384] (Cohen would wire his personal funds to Davidson on October 27.)[385]\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Trump was behind the hush-money talks.[386] However, he also acknowledged how Cohen wired the transfer and that he also had conversations with Howard as well as Daniels\' manager Gina Rodriguez regarding the deal. Howard and Rodriguez, who had no direct roles, would encourage Davidson to connect with Cohen. Daniels, Davidson and Rodriguez were also revealed to have received part of the $130,000 settlement payment. Davidson\'s role in the $150,000 deal with AMI for McDougal\'s story was noted as well.[375]\n\nOn May 2, the jury heard an audio recording of Cohen and Trump from September 6, 2016 appearing to discuss paying Pecker for McDougal\'s story, wherein Cohen mentions talking to Weisselberg about setting up the payment and Trump asks, ""So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?""[387] Further audio was played of a phone call in which Cohen tells Davidson that ""I can\'t even tell you how many times [Trump] said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it,"" apparently regarding the payment to Daniels.[157] Davidson acknowledged texting Howard on Election Night 2016: ""What have we done?"", to which Howard responded ""Oh my god.""[158] Davidson explained that this was a recognition that ""our activities may have assisted the presidential campaign"" and that it was ""sort of gallows humor"".[388] He also confirmed that, after texting with Cohen on February 13, 2018, he sent a statement to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo to corroborate Cohen\'s claim of having paid $130,000 to Daniels from his personal funds.[389] Davidson testified during his cross-examination that he had never personally met Trump.[157]\n\nOn May 2, prosecutors called Douglas Daus, a computer forensics specialist in the district attorney\'s office. Daus testified to examinations of Cohen\'s cell phones. Several of the prosecutions proposed exhibits were found by Daus.[390]\n\nHope Hicks\n\nSee also: Hope Hicks § Career\n\nOn May 3, former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified. She said a Wall Street Journal reporter asked her for comment on the alleged Trump–McDougal affair, which is how she learned that AMI had paid to catch and kill the story.[391] She stated that she drafted a statement to respond to The Wall Street Journal, with Cohen offering feedback, but Trump overrode them by telling Hicks to say that McDougal\'s allegations were ""totally untrue"",[392][393] which is how she was quoted by the Journal just days before the election.[394][357] Hicks also learned at this time that the Journal planned to publish details of Daniels\' allegations, with Trump instructing Hicks to deny any affair.[395] Hicks stated that Trump sought to hide news of both scandals from Melania,[396][395] and after the story of the payment to Daniels broke in early 2018, Trump told her that Cohen had voluntarily decided to pay Daniels to protect him; Hicks opined that this seemed out of character for Cohen.[395] Trump sought Hicks\'s opinion about how the Daniels story was being perceived, especially in relation to the negative impact it may have had if Cohen had not paid Daniels before the election.[393][397] Hicks further testified that she had heard Trump praise Pecker on multiple occasions for his negative reporting on his Republican rivals in the 2016 election.[395]\n\nAccording to Hicks, the Access Hollywood tape roiled the Trump campaign.[395] Though Trump tried to minimize its significance,[398] the campaign felt the tape was a ""crisis"".[399] Hicks stated that the tape\'s release stressed Trump because he wanted members of his family, including Melania, to be proud of him and not hurt or embarrassed.[400] In her cross-examination by the defense, Hicks stated that Trump ""is a very good multitasker [who] is always doing many things at once"".[371]\n\nMcConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin\n\nThree witnesses appeared during May 6 and the earlier part of May 7.\n\nOn May 6, former Trump Organization comptroller Jeffrey McConney testified about how Cohen was reimbursed.[401] He testified that Weisselberg instructed him in early 2017 to send the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401][402][403] McConney acknowledged that he told organization payroll specialist (and its accounts payable supervisor) Deborah Tarasoff to record the reimbursement payments as ""legal expenses""; he said he told her these payments were part of a retainer agreement between Cohen and Trump.[401] McConney further stated that starting in March 2017, the reimbursement checks for Cohen came from Trump\'s personal bank account.[401] In 2017, Cohen quit working for Trump after setting up shop at Squire Patton Boggs\'s offices in Midtown, but nevertheless still identified himself as Trump\'s personal lawyer.[401] Numerous invoice messages from Cohen and related emails between McConney, Tarasoff and Weisselberg were shown in the courtroom.[401] Several general ledger documents associated with Trump and his trust were reviewed which showed that Trump made the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401]\n\nFollowing McConney\'s testimony, Deborah Tarasoff, a 24-year employee of the Trump Organization who works in accounting, took the stand to testify. She said the organization was paying for her attorney.[404][401] She described her job duties: ""I get approved bills, I enter them into the system, and I cut checks.""[405] Tarasoff stated that she had no decision-making authority and merely followed instructions, but also acknowledged that she would approve invoices if she got them, including the ones which were sent to Cohen.[402] Tarasoff testified that while either Trump or one of his two older sons could approve invoices of over $10,000 since 2015, only Trump could access his personal checking account.[402] Twelve reimbursement checks for $35,000 were signed by Trump, and Tarasoff testified that they were mailed to Cohen.[402] Trump, who used a Sharpie pen when writing checks, could write ""void"" if he disapproved of checks Tarasoff created for the company[402] (e.g. a $70,000 check to Cohen signed by Eric Trump and Wiesselberg in February 2017, which was voided by Trump).[402] She testified that Weisselberg ""had his hands in everything"".[403] During cross-examination, Tarasoff acknowledged that she not was present for conversations between Trump and Weisselberg about the payments.[402]\n\nOn May 7, 2024, Penguin Books executive Sally Franklin testified. Franklin, whose company published a few Trump books, read excerpts from Trump: How to Get Rich and Trump: Think Like a Billionaire, including Trump quotes, ""If you don\'t know every aspect of what you\'re doing, down to the paper clips, you\'re setting yourself up for some unwanted surprises,"" and, ""For many years, I\'ve said that if someone screws you, screw them back.""[406]\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nStormy Daniels testified for five hours on May 7,[407] and for the earlier part of May 9.[408] She said she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 2006 and detailed a sexual encounter with Trump in his hotel suite after he invited her to dinner.[407][409] Daniels stated that Trump did not use a condom and that during the encounter, ""I was staring up at the ceiling, wondering how I got there,"" despite not having used drugs or alcohol.[407][z] She said she felt like she blacked out during the encounter and was traumatized by the experience.[411][409] It was the only time they reputedly had sex.[412] Daniels said Trump offered to make her a contestant on The Apprentice; she stated that he continued alluding to the idea for a time in subsequent phone conversations, in which he referred to her as ""honey bunch"" and asked when they could meet again.[406][409] Daniels noted that she met with Trump on multiple occasions, with dozens of witnesses,[409] including a visit to Trump Tower and a final encounter with Trump in Los Angeles in 2007.[409]\n\nIn accepting the hush money, Daniels stated that she was not motivated by money (although this appeared to be contradicted by a text message between her and her manager Gina Rodriguez which suggested she was willing to accept the payment).[409] She stated that she had no part in the hush-money negotiations.[409] Daniels also laid out key information about the payment.[409] She maintained her previous allegation that someone threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot, stating that she did not report it because it would have been upsetting to Trump.[409] Daniels stated that any violation of the hush-money agreement would have cost her a million dollars.[409]\n\nDuring Daniels\' testimony, Merchan sustained many defense objections.[409] He repeatedly admonished Daniels for giving answers that went beyond the scope of the question asked, and at one point interrupting Daniels\' testimony, stopping her from describing the sexual position she and Trump used.[407][409] Merchan criticized the ""degree of detail"" on matters such as the floor size of the hotel suite.[406] In a sidebar conference, Merchan agreed with defense arguments that Daniels described things which were ""better left unsaid"" regarding the sexual encounter, but denied the defense\'s request for a mistrial, noting that the defense would have the opportunity to cross-examine Daniels.[407][409] Merchan set confines for Daniels\' later testimony and directed the prosecution to encourage her to give shorter answers.[409] Afterward, Daniels gave shorter answers and hewed closer to the question asked.[407]\n\nWhen testimony resumed, Daniels stated that her lawyer Keith Davidson received the $130,000 hush-money payment, and that she got $96,000 of it. She also acknowledged that she signed a statement dated January 10, 2018, in which she denied the affair, but testified that she did not want to sign it and that it was untrue.[409]\n\nIn its cross-examination, the defense questioned Daniels about her account of being traumatized by her encounter with Trump, suggesting that her pornographic career would have made the event unsurprising. Daniels explained that the first time she realized the meeting was intended to be sexual was upon coming out of the bathroom inside Trump\'s hotel, finding him stripped to his boxers; she elaborated that she was ""not expecting [this from] a man twice [her] age"".[411] Daniels acknowledged that she had contacted renowned high-profile sexual harassment attorney Gloria Allred about potentially suing Trump for the encounter. Much of the cross-examination focused on questioning the accuracy of her allegation that she was threatened in a Las Vegas parking lot, which was revealed to have been disputed by Davidson via texts with Cohen. Despite accepting the hush money, Daniels maintained that her primary goal was to ""get the story out"".[409]\n\nOn May 9, Daniels concluded her testimony after hours of cross-examination.[408] Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Daniels on how she profited from her story and brought up minor inconsistencies in how she has told it.[408] Merchan again denied a defense motion for a mistrial, but would provide the jury instructions instructions limiting the use of her testimony.[413][414] [aa] Trump criticized Merchan for permitting the testimony stating ""He’s [Merchan] trying to make it as salacious as possible by allowing testimony that has nothing to do with the case.""[418]\n\nManochio, Menzies, and Westerhout\n\nOn May 9, Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper at the Trump Organization, testified for about a half-hour. She had provided evidence to the prosecution.[419][420] Tracy Menzies, a senior vice president at HarperCollins, then testified about the accuracy of certain excerpts from the book Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life, which Trump had co-authored.[421]\n\nTrump\'s director of Oval Office Operations in 2019 and former Secretary to the President between 2017 and 2019, Madeleine Westerhout, also began testifying the same day.[408][414] She stated that Republican National Committee officials she was working with in 2016 discussed how to replace Trump as the Republican presidential nominee due to concern about the damaging Access Hollywood tape.[422] She also noted how she set up a meeting between Cohen and Trump in February 2017, and how the meeting led to Trump Organization employees sending reimbursement checks to the White House—which Trump would then sign and send to Cohen—through a circuitous mail system.[423] She was in tears when discussing how Trump fired her, reportedly in response to her telling reporters that she had a better relationship with him than his daughters.[424]\n\nWesterhout resumed testifying on May 10.[423] During cross-examination, Westerhout appeared to side with defense arguments that Trump used alternatives to the White House mail system because he wanted to get mail to people more quickly.[423]\n\nDixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider\n\nFor the later part of May 10, four other witnesses testified.[425] Among these witnesses were Jennie Tomalin (a Verizon senior analyst), Daniel Dixon (an AT&T compliance analyst), and Jaden Jarmel-Schneider (a paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office).[423] In successive testimonies, Dixon and Tomalin would authenticate cell phone records which were used as trial evidence.[423] Georgia Longstreet, another paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office, again testified after previously doing so days prior.[423] Longstreet also showed some of Trump\'s old tweets, as well as texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard.[423] Jarmel-Schneider then showed a chart which summarized 34 business records which prosecutors say were falsified.[423]\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nOn May 13, Michael Cohen, Trump\'s former ""fixer"" and attorney (who is considered the case\'s star witness), began testifying.[426] He would give 17 hours of testimony over four days.[427]\n\nOn May 13, Cohen acknowledged that he, Trump and David Pecker conspired to suppress negative stories and promote positive stories about Trump during the 2016 election.[426] He said his work in this matter ""was at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump"", stating that ""Everything required Mr. Trump\'s sign-off.""[428] By email (shown as evidence), Cohen informed the National Enquirer that Trump did not want them to report his affair with a ""Penthouse Pet"".[426] Cohen specified his role in the Enquirer\'s first catch-and-kill story for Trump, about a Trump Tower doorman who alleged that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.[426] Cohen detailed his role in the hush-money payment to McDougal, stating that he monitored progress by text, phone and the Signal app.[426] He repeated that he communicated by ""phone, email and text"" with McDougal, Daniels and Keith Davidson.[426][9] By text message, Cohen told Dylan Howard that he was making the payments on Trump\'s behalf.[426] He further noted that after Pecker refused to pay for the Daniels story, he took over as funder of ""catch-and-kill operations"".[426]\n\nCohen acknowledged Hicks\'s testimony about the conversation over the McDougal payment press coverage.[426] According to Cohen, he and everybody at the organization had contact with Weisselberg.[426] He further accused Weisselberg of providing him with the financial advice concerning the payment to McDougal, stating that it foreshadowed the way he arranged for the Daniels payment.[426] Cohen said he first spoke to Trump about the Daniels allegation in 2011 after it was leaked to The Dirty, and that Trump called her ""a beautiful woman"" (having said the same about McDougal) and said they had met in 2006 at a golf outing and that she had liked him more than football star ""Big Ben"". Cohen said Trump did not respond when he asked if he had had sex with her and that Trump took him up on his offer to get the story taken down.[9]\n\nCohen said the release of the Access Hollywood tape was viewed as a campaign liability and that Trump afterwards directed him to pay Daniels to avoid ""catastrophic"" damage.[426][9] Cohen said that he viewed supermarket tabloids like the National Enquirer to be influential in reaching voters[426] and that Trump was concerned about the effect Daniels\' story could have had on female voters.[426] Cohen stated that Trump told him: ""Just pay it. There\'s no reason to keep this thing out there. Just do it.""[429] Cohen testified that Weisselberg told him to not make the payment through the Trump Organization and instead to come up with a more creative way to do it.[426] Cohen said that he and Weisselberg discussed processing the $130,000 through one of Trump\'s golf courses as if it were a membership or event fee but they decided against it. When Weisselberg said he lacked the personal finances, Cohen agreed to pay it.[429] Cohen said he suggested the idea of including a clause in the nondisclosure agreement penalizing Daniels $1,000,000 every time she told her story.[426] After Trump\'s 2016 election victory, Weisselberg and Cohen discussed the reimbursement plan in Trump\'s 26th-floor office, and Weisselberg coordinated the repayments to Cohen.[426] A bank statement for Essential Consultants LLC from the end of October 2016 was presented, which showed the $130,000 sent to Keith Davidson and featured a note Cohen said was handwritten by Weisselberg. It showed the doubling of the $180,000 reimbursement—$130,000 for Daniels plus $50,000 for money Trump owed Cohen for paying tech company Red Finch (to poll for the Trump campaign and promote Cohen on Twitter as something of a sex symbol)—so that Cohen would receive the full amount after paying 50% in taxes, plus a $60,000 year-end bonus, totaling $420,000. Cohen said it occurred to him that Weisselberg and Trump had planned this reimbursement scheme in advance and that Weisselberg had said in Trump\'s presence that the monthly payments would function in the guise of a retainer agreement.[430][401]\n\nCohen testified that he aspired to be a personal lawyer to the president but that Trump, instead of granting him this role, significantly cut his 2016 bonus. Cohen said his relationship with Trump was falling apart at this time. He said his work for Trump boosted his personal career, including by securing more prominent clients.[426]\n\nOn May 14, Cohen said he sent the Trump Organization false invoices requesting money for ""services rendered"". He said that, in February 2017, he confronted Trump in the Oval Office over his lack of repayment.[431] He said he lied about Daniels to protect Trump (while also ""staying on Trump\'s message"" by lying about the Trump Tower Moscow project).[432] Cohen testified that, in January 2018, he pressured Davidson to have Daniels sign a false statement denying the affair and payment, which Daniels signed on January 30, and also offered her an appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity.[433][434] Cohen testified that Daniels also wanted an appearance on Fox News\' Hannity, which she did not go through with.[435][434] Cohen also testified that he decided to stop lying for Trump following a meeting he had with his family shortly before his 2018 guilty plea.[435] Before the day concluded, Cohen began defense cross-examination.[435] On May 16, a Trump lawyer accused Cohen of lying that on October 26, 2016, he was on the phone with Trump\'s personal bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and had him hand the phone to Trump, who then approved the hush-money deal. The defense cited phone records as showing that a series of prank calls to Cohen had prompted him to contact Schiller for a call lasting one minute and 36 seconds, which Cohen defended as enough time to handle both matters.[436]\n\nOn May 20, during cross-examination, Cohen confirmed that around October 26, 2016, he helped Tiffany Trump regarding an extortion issue she faced. He said he was also working with David Pecker that month.[437] Cohen made two brief calls to Donald Trump on the morning of October 26,[438] which he said were about Daniels.[439] On January 27, 2017, Cohen told the Trump Organization he would no longer be working at Trump Tower because he was now Trump\'s ""personal attorney"".[440] On January 31, 2017, Weisselberg emailed Cohen with the subject: ""Note and mortgage modification agreement for Trump Park Avenue Condominium."" Weisselberg asked Cohen to ""prepare the agreement discussed"" so Weisselberg could start sending monthly payments.[441] Cohen said that Donald Jr. and Eric Trump signed the checks ""because they were the trustees"".[442] In 2017, he received nine checks for $35,000 apiece directly from Trump, plus two checks from the trust.[443] Cohen confirmed that he lied to Weisselberg about how much he had paid Red Finch, and that his false reimbursement request amounted to theft from the organization.[444][445][446][447] He said he lied in 2018 when he said that Trump had been unaware of the Daniels payment.[448] He said he had no income between his 2018 guilty plea[449] and the publication of his 2020 memoir,[450] but that since then he had earned $4.4 million from podcasts and books.[451] Asked whether he has a ""financial interest in the outcome of this case"", Cohen said he expected to make more money if Trump was found not guilty, since ""it gives me more to talk about"".[452][453] He acknowledged that his name recognition comes from his frequent criticism of Trump and that he was even interested in running for Congress.[446]\n\nDefense cross-examination of Cohen concluded on May 20. Cohen testified that the retainer agreement Weisselberg proposed he maintain with Trump to conceal the monthly reimbursements was fraudulent in nature.[454][430]\n\nThe defense pointed to occasions when Cohen did legal work, and said this was evidence that he was retained as a lawyer under a valid retainer agreement, as Cohen would not do legal work for free, nor would Trump pay in excess of reimbursements. Additionally, the defense pointed out that CFO Weisselberg requested from Cohen an agreement without suggesting it would be a fake agreement: ""please prepare the agreement we discussed so we can pay you monthly.""[455][456][457]\n\nThe prosecution then conducted redirect examination. The prosecution rested its case the same day.[458][459][460]\n\nDefense witnesses\n\nThe defense began its case on May 20, 2024, and rested its case on May 21 after calling two witnesses.[427][461] Trump did not testify.[462][463][ab] On May 22, he stated (in a press interview outside the court proceedings) that he did not testify because (1) he disagreed with Merchan\'s past rulings, (2) he was concerned about being questioned about his own past, and (3) there was ""no case"".[464][471][ac]\n\nThe defense team had initially planned to call Bradley Smith, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as an expert witness on campaign finance law.[473] Smith had argued that the payments to Daniels were not campaign payments and not illegal.[474] However, on May 20, Judge Merchan ruled that Smith\'s testimony would be limited to ""general definitions and terms"" so as to not supplant the judge\'s role to determine what the law is.[475][476] Smith was prohibited from mentioning ""there had never been a case in which anyone had been convicted of a federal campaign finance law violation for the making of \'hush money payments\'"" and from discussing ""that the FEC dismissed the complaint against defendant and the DOJ decided against prosecuting defendant for potential FECA violations"" due to irrelevance.[477] In February 2024, prosecutors pointed out that Smith had previously been barred from testifying for the defense in two unrelated federal cases in Manhattan where the defense had improperly sought to have Smith interpret campaign finance law for the jury: United States v. Bankman-Fried and United States v. Suarez.[476] As a result, the defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.[478][479] Trump then falsely stated that Merchan had not allowed Smith to be called,[480] and Smith wrote that the ""judge\'s bias is very evident.""[481]\n\nDaniel Sitko\n\nOn May 20, Daniel Sitko, a paralegal for Todd Blanche, provided testimony.[482] A chart of phone calls between Cohen and Robert Costello, the lawyer that Giuliani suggested Cohen hire in 2018, was submitted into evidence.[483]\n\nRobert Costello\n\nOn May 20, Robert Costello also testified.[484] Merchan admonished the witness for making comments on the stand objecting to rulings, staring at the judge, and rolling his eyes.[485]\n\nOn May 21, Costello was cross-examined by the prosecution.[486] Emails from Costello to his law partner Jeff Citron and Cohen were shown. In a May 2018 email to Citron, Costello said it was a goal to get Cohen ""on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president"" and said he believed it was ""the clear and correct strategy"".[486][487] When asked if ""the email speaks for itself"" as he had asserted the day before, Costello said ""Sometimes."" He also wrote to Citron about Cohen, ""What should I say to this asshole? He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet."" (Cohen testified that Costello and Trump\'s campaign had attempted to pressure him to realign to their interests.)[486] In an email to Cohen, Costello wrote: ""You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these \'journalists\' are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed. If you really believe you are not being supported properly by your former boss, then you should make your opinion known.""[486] The defense rested its case thereafter.[486]\n\nClosing arguments and jury instructions\n\nLater on May 21, arguments over jury instruction language were held.[486] Merchan announced that the jury would be excused until the beginning of summations on May 28.[486][463] Merchan stated that the closing arguments ""will not be quick"" and that he expected his final instructions to the jury to last an hour.[486] On Memorial Day, May 27, Trump complained that the prosecution would get the last word as ""very unfair"", though this is standard procedure in criminal trials where the state has the burden of proof.[488][ad]\n\nOn May 28, the defense gave a three-hour closing argument including breaks.[492] Trump lawyer Todd Blanche claimed Trump had nothing to do with checks which were written by Trump\'s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.[493] Blanche questioned why prosecutors did not call Donald Jr. and Eric as witnesses despite their signing payment checks to Cohen.[493] Blanche also showed an email revealing that McConnery sought approval from both Donald Jr. and Eric.[493] Blanche alleged that it was Cohen\'s decision to make the hush-money payment and variously branded him a prolific liar.[493] Blanche sought to discredit Daniels\' ambitions, noting (among other things) text messages between her manager and publicist Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard which showed that Howard believed Pecker would pay for her story shortly after the Access Hollywood tape was released.[493] Merchan admonished Blanche for telling the jury: ""You cannot send someone to prison, you cannot convict somebody, based upon the words of Michael Cohen."" Merchan said this type of comment is ""highly inappropriate"" and ""not allowed"",[494] as the jury is instructed not to consider how Merchan might sentence Trump.[495][496][497]\n\nThe same day, the prosecution gave a four-hour and 41 minute closing argument including breaks.[493] Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass described Pecker\'s testimony as ""utterly damning"".[493] Steinglass noted that some key parts of Daniels\' story were proven true[493] and noted that the defense appeared to acknowledge that Trump knew about the Daniels payment as early as 2017.[493] Steinglass stated that it made sense that Cohen was interested in the outcome of the case, noting that Trump dropped him ""like a hot potato"" when their relationship soured.[498] Steinglass argued that Cohen was Trump\'s ""fixer"" and that his knowledge was ""limited to what actually happened"".[493] It was noted that Cohen did not work for the Trump Organization\'s legal department and answered directly to Trump.[493] A footnote from the 2018 Office of Government Ethics form was shown, which stated that ""In 2016 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump\'s attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.""[493]\n\nSteinglass went over phone conversations between Trump and Cohen regarding the hush-money payment and showed a December 2017 check to Cohen signed via Sharpie by Donald Trump,[493] arguing that the latter must have known the purpose of such checks, as his ""entire business philosophy was and is to be involved in everything"".[499] Steinglass cited a 2018 tweet by Trump in which he acknowledged that Cohen was reimbursed for an NDA via a retainer agreement, but said it had ""nothing to do with the campaign"".[499] Steinglass said the defense\'s characterization of the payments to Cohen was undermined by his lack of pay from Trump in 2018 despite Cohen doing legal work for him that year.[499] Steinglass further stated that the payment was made to ""hoodwink the American voter"".[493][500] At the end of closing arguments, Merchan said that jury instructions would be read on May 29 and were expected to last an hour.[493] Trump described the closing arguments as ""BORING!"" on Truth Social.[501][502][503]\n\nJury deliberations and verdict\n\nOn May 29, the jury began deliberations.[504] A few hours in, they asked to hear a readback of about 30 minutes of testimony by Pecker and Cohen; the readback was held the following day.[505] It regarded an August 2015 meeting between Pecker, Cohen, Trump, and Hicks, in which Pecker pledged to be Trump\'s ""eyes and ears"" regarding negative stories about him; additionally, the jury wanted to hear Pecker\'s testimony regarding an alleged phone call from Trump in which the two discussed a rumor that McDougal had gone to another outlet to publish her story.[506][507][508]\n\nOn May 30 at 5:07 pm EDT, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts,[1][509] making him the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony.[510] Merchan denied a defense motion for an acquittal.[511]\n\nPost-trial proceedings\n\nGag order\n\nOn May 31, 2024, the day after the trial ended, Trump told reporters he wanted to have the ""nasty gag order"" lifted.[512] On June 4, Blanche filed a motion to have the gag order lifted, stating: ""Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the government and the Court do not justify restrictions on the First Amendment rights of President Trump"".[513] On June 5, Matthew Colangelo asked that the gag order remain in place to ""to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.""[514][515] Many expected Trump, had the gag order been lifted, to assail trial participants including the witnesses, jury, and court staff, as well as their families.[516][517]\n\nOn June 18, the New York Court of Appeals said it would not hear an earlier appeal by Trump on the gag order, leaving it in place.[518]\n\nOn June 25, two days before the first 2024 United States presidential debates, Merchan partially lifted the gag order permitting Trump to comment on witnesses and jurors, but Trump cannot reveal the jurors\' identities, nor comment about court staffers, the prosecution team nor their families until after sentencing.[519][520][521]\n\nIn July 2024, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a lawsuit against New York State in an attempt to invoke the Supreme Court\'s exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes between two states.[522] The lawsuit sought to block Trump\'s gag order and sentencing until after the November election, accusing New York of interfering with the presidential election in Missouri and violating Missourians\' First Amendment rights.[522] On August 5, the Supreme Court ruled against intervening in the case.[523]\n\nImmunity ruling\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States, supporting presidential immunity for official acts committed by the seated president. Later that day, Trump\'s counsel requested permission to move to dismiss the conviction on the basis that some evidence presented in the trial constituted official actions by Trump.[222][524] This includes 2018 social media posts by Trump, phone records between Trump and Cohen, a government ethics disclosure referencing the hush money payment, and some of Hicks\' and Westerhout\'s testimony.[525][526][527]\n\nTrump\'s motion was formally made on July 11.[527] Merchan\'s ruling will center on whether the evidence presented constituted official actions, and whether it influenced the verdict.[525] If the conviction is overturned, prosecutors would need to convene another grand jury to issue a new indictment.[527]\n\nJudge Hellerstein had previously rejected defense arguments to this effect in July 2023 when Trump attempted to remove the case to federal court, saying that ""the matter was purely a personal item of the President.""[352]\n\nMerchan\'s ruling on immunity was initially expected by September 6. It was postponed so he could consider Trump\'s third recusal motion, which he denied on August 13.[528] The immunity ruling was expected by September 16.[529][530] On September 3, hours before Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request to remove his case to federal court, prosecutors urged Merchan to rule swiftly on the immunity question, expressing concern that Hellerstein might pause state court proceedings.[531] On September 6, Merchan postponed the immunity ruling to November 12.[532] On that day, Merchan agreed to a request from prosecutors to pause the case for a week while they considered how Trump\'s election could impact proceedings.[533][534] On November 19, the Manhattan DA argued that the conviction should stand because no law states that temporary presidential immunity nullifies—post-trial—proceedings conducted during the president\'s time outside of office and regarding activities deemed unofficial to that post.[535]\n\nDelayed sentencing hearing\n\nBefore his conviction, officials in state and federal agencies began preparing for possible incarceration.[536][537] Trump\'s rhetoric and lack of acknowledgement of any wrongdoing is expected to negatively impact the leniency of his sentence.[538] Trump\'s proponents have argued that any sentence restricting Trump\'s mobility or communication with voters could undermine confidence in the 2024 election.[539] Trump was the presumptive 2024 Republican Party nominee leading up to the 2024 Republican National Convention, and the party prepared for a prison nomination broadcast were he to be incarcerated before the start of the Republican National Convention on July 15.[540]\n\nTrump\'s sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for July 11.[541] However, Trump\'s counsel requested on July 1 to delay sentencing to consider the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States released that day.[222][524] The Manhattan DA\'s office agreed to the delay, though it said the Trump team\'s position lacked merit.[542] On July 2, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to September 18.[543] In August, Trump\'s team asked Merchan to again postpone the sentencing hearing until after the election,[544] and the Manhattan DA stated that it would defer to Merchan on this matter.[545] On September 6, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to November 26.[532][546]\n\nOn August 29, Trump\'s lawyers asked the federal court for the Southern District of New York to seize control of the case, complaining that a September sentencing date would amount to election interference.[547] On September 3, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request on the basis that the payments were an unofficial act.[548][549] Hours later, Trump\'s attorneys filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.[550] Although Merchan granted the sentencing delay, on October 14 Trump\'s counsel asked the Second Circuit to reconsider Hellerstein\'s rejection, arguing that it was based upon ""profoundly flawed analysis"" and continuing to assert that instead of being personally prosecuted, Trump was being politically persecuted.[549]\n\nOn November 12, the immunity hearing was delayed a week.[551] On that day, November 19, the Manhattan DA agreed to postpone sentencing until Trump leaves office.[535] On November 22, Merchan canceled the November 26 sentencing date without setting a new one.[552] Trump\'s appeal cannot take place until after sentencing.[462]\n\nProhibitory consequences\n\nTrump had turned over two of the three pistols he was licensed for to the New York Police Department (NYPD) on March 31, 2023, with a third pistol moved to Florida.[553] Trump\'s New York State concealed carry license was suspended on April 1, 2023, following his indictment on criminal charges.[554] New York state law and federal law prohibit people with felony convictions from possessing firearms, and federal law even prohibits people under indictment or information for a felony (but not convicted) from possessing firearms, a violation of which can result in up to 15 years imprisonment, or life imprisonment if one is subject to the enhanced penalties imposed by the Armed Career Criminal Act.[555] [556] As of June 5, 2024, Trump\'s New York firearm license is expected to be revoked after the NYPD\'s legal bureau completes its investigation.[557] At Trump\'s pre-sentence hearing on June 10, 2024, CNN reported that Trump was still in possession of the third firearm in Florida.[558][559]\n\nOn June 10, 2024, Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche attended his probation interview via videoconference.[560][ae] If placed on probation, Trump cannot associate with other convicted felons.[561][565]\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control declined to renew the liquor licenses for Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and Colts Neck, instead issuing temporary permits.[566] The alcohol laws of New Jersey prohibit a liquor license from being issued to ""any person who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude"", typically involving a serious crime involving ""dishonesty, fraud or depravity"".[566][567][568] Though the Trump Organization has stated that Trump is not connected with the liquor licenses, New Jersey attorney general pointed out that Trump is the sole beneficiary of his revocable trust, which owns the licenses.[566][569] A hearing for the licenses was expected to be held on July 19, but was delayed until after Trump\'s sentencing.[570][566]\n\nPotential appeal of conviction\n\nTrump has a right to one level of appeal for the conviction itself, which he is expected to use.[571][462] The appeal would be heard by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, which is the intermediate state appellate court covering Manhattan and the Bronx. If unsuccessful, the next step would be the New York Court of Appeals, the state\'s highest court, which has discretion whether to hear an appeal.[572]\n\nReactions\n\nSee also\n\nArrests of Ulysses S.

Eventually, the judge stropped trying to control Trump – he and the attorney general’s lawyer questioning Trump let him rant, and then mostly disregarded the missives.\n\nThe high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. Engoron has already ruled Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The New York attorney general’s office said they will rest their case after Ivanka Trump’s testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand:\n\nTrump’s campaign comes to the courtroom: The former president’s rhetoric at times during his testimony might as well have been at one of his rallies in front of supporters. He went after the attorney general. The judge. And the “political witch hunt” that he’s been railing against for years now. On the witness stand, the charged rhetoric was even more remarkable, as he attacked the judge sitting right next to him, with James in the courtroom watching his testimony just feet away. “The fraud is on the court, not on me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump gets an angry response from the judge: Judge Engoron tried at the outset of Trump’s testimony to stop the former president from making speeches and instead answer the questions, but it did little to change Trump’s approach. The judge responded by threatening to remove Trump from the witness stand, though that didn’t deter the former president either. “This is not a political rally,” Engoron said to Trump, telling Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise to “control your client.”\n\nTrump acknowledges changing valuation of Trump Tower triplex: The attorney general’s office pressed Trump on the properties central to his identity and brand: Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and other key parts of his real estate empire. The AG’s office attorney Kevin Wallace also pressed Trump on why valuations of properties were changed, such as his Trump Tower triplex, which was devalued on his financial statement in 2017 after a Forbes article found he had dramatically exaggerated the size of the apartment. Trump acknowledged there had on occasion been mistakes, such as the Trump Tower apartment valuation.\n\nTrump’s descriptions of his properties: The former president’s rhetorical flourishes went beyond attacking those who are investigating him. He also took the opportunity to play salesman and play up his properties. One of his chief complaints about the judge is a citation in his decision that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18 million, a number based on Florida tax appraisal records “It’s much more valuable,” Trump said of Mar-a-Lago, “and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes, that it’s biggest value is using it as a club.” Wallace took the answer to pin him down on that valuation. “You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” Wallace asked. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here.\n\nTrump finishes testimony in fraud trial; Ivanka Trump to testify Wednesday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has stepped down from the stand after nearly four hours of testimony in the civil fraud trial against him and his company.\n\nThe next witness will be his daughter Ivanka Trump on Wednesday, after which the attorney general’s office plans to rest its case.\n\nTrump’s attorney Chris Kise said he believes the trial should end in mid-December.\n\nTrump on whether he maintained accurate records from August 2014 onward: ""I hope so""\n\nWhen asked by the Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office whether he “maintained accurate books and records” from August 2014 going forward, Donald Trump said “I hope so.”\n\n“I hope so, I didn’t keep them myself. I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nJudge interrupts Trump\'s ""irrelevant"" answer to questions about Scotland golf course valuation\n\nAs testimony began centering on the valuation of Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland — Trump lobbed an answer that Judge Arthur Engoron audibly deemed “irrelevant” to the question.\n\nThe New York assistant attorney general asked Trump if the description in his 2014 financial statement was accurate for the property — which followed by Trump touting Aberdeen as a oil capitol making the property more valuable.\n\n“Irrelevant, irrelevant, answer the question,” Engoron said speaking over Trump, one of the few times that’s happened since returning from the break.\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to boast about the course.\n\nAs Trump gave a long-winded answer about the beauty of the course, Engoron said he would be following the assistant attorney general’s lead: “If you want to let the witness ramble on, non responsive, repeat himself.”\n\nThe assistant attorney general was trying, unsuccessfully, to get Trump to acknowledge a discrepancy on the number of properties that could be built in Aberdeen.\n\n“It’s sort of like a painting. You can do pretty much what you want to do. The land is there and you can do what you want to do,” Trump said.\n\nTrump questioned about the value of Mar-a-Lago\n\nDonald Trump says he believes Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\n“You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” asked Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nThe valuation of Mar-a-Lago has been one of Trump’s complaints about the judge in the trial, after the judge cited a Florida tax appraisal of $18 million for the property in his decision finding Trump, his adult sons and his company committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nWallace asked Trump if he approved of valuing Mar-a-Lago as if it would be sold to an individual as a resident. “Did I approve it on this? I don’t know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump replied, “I don’t remember that, no” when asked if he explicitly told former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg or former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney to value the property that way.\n\nWallace confronted Trump with a 2002 deed of development rights that shows Trump deeded away his right to use the property as anything other than a social club.\n\nTrump then gave a long aside about Mar-a-Lago when Wallace asked him about not being able to use it as anything but a social club.\n\n“I don’t mind leaving it as a club. In fact, if somebody wanted it, smartest thing to do, have a club and have one member and that would be the member that lives in the club. But it’s much more valuable — and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes — that its biggest value is using it as a club,” Trump said.\n\nWallace showed Trump a 2003 article in which the former president told a reporter Mar-A-Lago will always be a club.\n\n“I think that was said with bravado more than legal intent,” Trump said on the stand.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nWhat the scene is like inside the courtroom as Trump takes the stand\n\nIt was an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump took the witness stand a bit ago in New York. The former president slowly climbed a couple of steps into the box and raised his hand to take the oath.\n\nFormer presidents are typically surrounded by a force-field of deference, due to their status and are accompanied everywhere by Secret Service agents.\n\nBut Trump, in a blue suit, shirt and blue tie rather than his typical campaign uniform of white shirt and red tie, is sitting in the witness box alone in a leather chair, with wood panels on either side. His hands are clasped in his lap, and a large bottle of water and two smaller ones are to his left beside a screen allowing him to see court documents.\n\nThis is a civil trial rather than a criminal one. And the American people can’t see it because it’s not televised. But this the moment when the reality of the 2024 campaign hit home. Trump is simultaneously a multiple defendant, as well as being the Republican front-runner and potential next US president.\n\nThis is the most extraordinary campaign in modern history in microcosm.\n\nTrump says he would on occasion make suggestions on financial docs at heart of the trial\n\nFurther questioning in today’s civil fraud trial turned toward the financial documents at the heart of the trial, with Donald Trump saying he would look at financial statements, and on occasion make suggestions.\n\nTrump says of his statements of financial condition, “I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions.”\n\nThe former president says that bankers didn’t pay much attention to his financial statements, and says that is going to be part of their defense.\n\n“We’ll explain that as this trial goes along. This crazy trial goes along. Because we’re bringing in the bankers. Very big bankers,” Trump says. “They will explain exactly what their process is.”\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to. They looked at the deal,” he testified.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump arrives to court ahead of testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has arrived at a New York courthouse to face questions in the $250 million civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nJudge overseeing Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order on Friday\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order in the trial to extend to Trump’s attorneys after they raised multiple questions about the judge’s communications with his law clerk.\n\nIn a written order Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron prohibited Trump’s attorneys from making any further comments about confidential communications between the judge and his staff inside or outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe judge said violating the order would result in “serious sanctions.”\n\nAnalysis: Trump heads to the witness stand as the latest polls show him leaping past Biden in key swing states\n\nA year away from Election Day 2024, former President Donald Trump is set to testify in a civil fraud trial and separately faces more than 90 criminal charges, setting up the possibility that a convicted felon tops the Republican ticket next November.\n\nBut it’s President Joe Biden’s political prospects that are plunging.\n\nIn another extraordinary twist to a 2024 campaign season that is more notable for court hearings than treks through early voting states, Trump is expected to be called to the witness stand in New York on Monday. This is hardly typical activity during a post-presidency. But Trump was, after all, the most unconventional president.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is absorbing brutal new polls showing him losing to GOP front-runner Trump in multiple key swing states. The numbers will likely ignite panic among Democrats and renew doubts among Americans that the soon-to-be-81-year-old is up to a full second term. If the New York Times/Siena College survey is borne out in 2024, there would be no electoral path to victory for Biden. And an increasingly authoritarian Trump – who is promising a second term of “retribution” – could pull off a White House comeback in spite of sparking a Capitol insurrection with his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020.\n\n“I was concerned before these polls, and I’m concerned now,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“These presidential races over the last couple of terms have been very tight. No one is going to have a runaway election here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, concentration, resources. And so we have our work cut out for us.”\n\nThe coinciding crises facing both Trump and Biden belie the fact that, for all their deficiencies, neither is yet to face a serious challenger from within their parties as they seek the nomination.\n\nBiden’s position is weakening as he tackles cascading global threats such as the war in the Middle East, sheds support over his handling of the economy and sees cracks in the multiracial coalition that first elected him. It also reflects a nation that is divided and disconsolate, and groping for the elusive normality that the president promised three years ago after the pandemic and the historic turbulence of the Trump administration.\n\nKeep reading here.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-us-canada-66978988', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump in New York court for $250m civil fraud trial - live ... - BBC', 'Snippet': 'Summary.

During the day he also called for Judge Arthur Engoron to be disbarred.\n\nThe morning session was a back and forward between sides, with the judge occasionally needing to interject to set things straight.\n\nIt\'s shaping up to be a fiery trial.\n\nIf you want more information about the fraud case, you can watch the video at the top of this post.\n\nAnd this article highlights five things you need to know about the court case.\n\nOur court reporters today have been Nada Tawfik and Madeline Halpert.\n\nAnd our writers were Brandon Drenon, Victoria Lindrea and Mike Wendling.\n\nThanks for joining us.\n\nTrump leaves court and once again gripes about having no jury\n\nDonald Trump seemed in a better mood at the conclusion of the day compared to his earlier statements.\n\nBut he did once again bring up his frustrations at not having a jury in this trial, which he called ""unusual"".\n\nThe judge had earlier told the court that there was no jury because the lawyers did not request a jury trial.\n\nTrump was also non-committal on if he would be back at court tomorrow, saying he might return but would rather be campaigning.\n\nWho is Alina Habba?\n\nDonald Bender is still giving testimony about being an accountant for Trump, but let\'s take a moment to talk about Alina Habba - a New Jersey-based lawyer who the New York Post labelled a ""firebrand"".\n\nHabba is the most Googled name of people involved in this trial (outside of Donald Trump, of course).\n\nHabba has become one of Trump\'s most trusted attorneys since she was hired in 2021.\n\nEarlier in her career, Habba worked as an executive at the renowned New York fashion designer Marc Jacobs. The 39-year-old mother-of-three was a relatively unknown civil litigation lawyer before working for Trump.\n\nSpeaking outside of a Miami courthouse in Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, she fiercely defended the former president.\n\n“The decision to pursue charges against President Trump while turning a blind eye to others is emblematic of the corruption that we have here,” Habba said.\n\nCurrently, Habba holds the managing partner position at Habba Madaio & Associates LLP, located near Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nWhat did Trump post online during the break?\n\nMike Wendling\n\nUS disinformation reporter\n\nWhen the court took a break, Trump took to his Truth Social network to once again rail against the judge and legal system.\n\nHe posted: “The highly political, Trump Hating Judge just stated that expert testimony is not evidence. Well, that means that every trial in American history has to be thrown out and started all over again!”\n\nTrump appears to be referring not to an actual ruling about the admissibility of expert testimony, but to a back-and-forth between the judge and his lawyer this morning about the weight to be given to a valuation by a specific expert.\n\nRemember, it’s the value of Trump’s properties that are key to this trial.\n\nTrump seems to be exaggerating for effect – it\'s hard to believe he really thinks the judge could invalidate the entire US legal system – but surely the former president and his lawyers will continue to disagree with the judge, both inside the court and online.\n\nMichael Cohen, the Trump supporter turned critic\n\nEarlier, the name Michael Cohen was brought up in court.\n\nSo who is he? Cohen is Donald Trump\'s former personal attorney, once known as his ""fixer"".\n\nCohen worked for Trump for more than a decade at the Trump Organization, as well as on the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and at the Republican National Committee.\n\nHe was sentenced to federal prison in December 2018 after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations and related crimes that happened while he was working for the ex-president.\n\nCohen then testified to a grand jury - transforming himself from Trump supporter to Trump critic.\n\nHe revealed details about alleged hush money payments he made to a porn star under Trump\'s instruction. His testimony led to Trump\'s eventual indictment on similar charges.\n\nIn a recent interview with MSNBC, Cohen said this New York civil fraud trial could be a “financial catastrophe” and a “deathblow to Donald”.\n\n“I can tell you this has always been his biggest fear. That he would lose all of his money and he would no longer be considered the mega-billionaire,” Cohen said.\n\nTrump hits out at judge before heading back into court\n\nThe former president just spoke to media for a brief moment outside the courtroom.\n\n""This judge should be disbarred. He shouldn\'t be allowed to be a judge,"" Trump says.\n\nIt\'s one of the same lines of attack he used in his statement this morning before court started.\n\nTrump has also been posting on his Truth Social media account in the past hour, saying once again that this is a ""witch hunt"".\n\nMar-a-Lago worth \'at least a billion\', Trump\'s lawyer says\n\nWhile court takes a break, let\'s look back at some more of what Trump\'s lawyer Alina Habba had to say.\n\nHabba was critical of the real estate valuations given to Trump\'s 17-acre Mar-a-Lago estate on the Florida coast.\n\nLast week, Judge Engoron ruled that the estate was over-valued by as much as 2,300% in one financial statement. He said the estate was likely valued between $18m and $27.6m.\n\nBut Habba says the value is whatever someone is willing to pay.\n\nShe says Mar-a-Lago would sell for ""at least a billion"".\n\nHubba said Trump\'s Doral golf course would also sell for at least a billion dollars.\n\nShe calls them ""Mona Lisa properties"" and says it\'s not fraud, it\'s just how real estate works.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/live-updates-trumps-new-york-fraud-trial-begins-rcna118320/rcrd19626', 'Headline': 'Highlights from Day 1 of the Trump New York civil trial - NBC News', 'Snippet': ""Monday is the first day of the trial in New York Attorney General Letitia James' $250 million fraud lawsuit against Trump, two of his adult children and his company.

""They made a lot of money, and they considered me a very good client.""\n\nThe former president also complained that his time spent at trial was keeping him off the campaign trail.\n\n""I\'ve been sitting in a courthouse all day long instead of being in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or a lot of other places I could be at,"" Trump said. ""This is a horrible situation for our country.""\n\n""It\'s election interference,"" he added.\n\nFirst day of trial concludes\n\nThe first day of the Trump civil trial has concluded.\n\nTrump appears ruffled during former accountant\'s testimony\n\nAs the day draws to a close, Trump is becoming very animated while talking to his attorneys. He in particular seems to be taking great issue with some of Bender’s testimony.\n\nAt times, he appears to be very upset, with his face turning beet red. At one point, Trump turned to Cliff Robert, the attorney for his adult sons, and whisper-yelled at him, while pointing and waving his finger.\n\nCourtroom riveted as Bender testifies about his accounting work for Trump\n\nand\n\nDonald Bender testified that when he did accounting for the Trump Organization from 2011 to 2021, he spent roughly 45% to 55% of his time on Trump-related work.\n\nBender said he prepared documents of Trump\'s assets and liabilities and that he would take information given by his client presented in a financial statement. He said that before technology improved, he would go to Trump Tower in person to obtain the necessary documents and put them in a binder. Then technology changed, he said, and they were able to get the records by email.\n\nEven though Bender was speaking in fairly dry accounting terms, everyone in the courtroom was still fully engaged and hanging on his every word.\n\nNew York prosecutors call first witness, Donald Bender\n\nand\n\nThe state has called its first witness, Donald Bender, who previously testified in the state\'s criminal trial against the Trump Organization, which led to the conviction of the company\'s former CFO Allen Weisselberg. He was released from jail earlier this year.\n\nBender was a partner at Mazars USA LLP who spent years preparing Trump\'s personal tax returns. Bender said in testimony last year at the Trump Organization criminal trial that the former president had losses totaling $900 million in 2009 and 2010.\n\nWeisselberg had already pleaded guilty at that point and was cooperating with prosecutors. The company was ultimately found guilty and fined $1.6 million.\n\nTrial resumes\n\nThe lunch break is over and the trial has resumed inside the courtroom.\n\nTrump rages against judge overseeing trial and N.Y. attorney general\n\nand\n\nDuring the lunch break, Trump spoke in front of cameras inside the courthouse arguing that Engoron is a ""rogue judge"" and that James is a ""corrupt person"" and a ""terrible person.""\n\nThe former president also called Engoron a ""Trump-hater,"" and at one point spoke about how people are ""being murdered right outside in the street"" and that nothing happens to those criminals.\n\n“We’re going to be here for months with a judge that already made up his mind. It’s ridiculous,” Trump complained to reporters during the lunch break, amping up his attacks on Engoron, whose rulings in the case could cost Trump’s company hundreds of millions of dollars and impact its ability to do business in New York.\n\n“This is a judge that should be disbarred. This is a judge that should be out of office. This is a judge that some people say could be charged criminally for what he’s doing. He’s interfering with an election, and it’s a disgrace,” Trump said.\n\nAsked why he wanted to attend the opening of the trial today, he said he wanted to ""watch this witch hunt,"" whose purpose, he said, is to interfere with the country\'s elections.\n\nTrump also bashed special counsel Jack Smith, who has charged him with federal counts in two other unrelated cases.\n\nCourt has recessed for a lunch break\n\nand\n\nThe trial has recessed for a lunch break. On his way out of the courtroom, Trump stared down James, looking down at her as he walked by and he glared angrily.\n\nTrump lawyer argues with judge in heated exchange\n\nand\n\nLead Trump attorney Chris Kise jumped in when Judge Engoron asked Clifford Robert, attorney for Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, at what point is something ""material."" Kise stood up and told Engoron that he owes it to the defendant to listen to the evidence, saying: “I don’t think you are an estimate on government accounting and they will tell you what is material and what is not.”\n\n“I would caution you to listen, there is a lot more to this story, there are layers to this and we need to give witnesses an opportunity to take the stand and learn what this case is about,” Kise said, adding that there are experts the judge hasn’t heard from.\n\nKise said James opened the door to issues involving valuation, which he said is “a serious accusation to make against one of the most successful employers in this state.”\n\nKise argued with the judge vociferously, which grew heated as he stood over Trump, who was seated next to him. At one point, Trump shook his head very dramatically, sat up in his chair and turned toward the gallery.\n\nAlina Habba speaks for the defense, argues there was no intent to defraud lenders\n\nTrump lawyer Alina Habba began speaking for the defense and accused Michael Cohen of being a liar and said that the attorney general would like the court to believe that Trump and his family committed a conspiracy to defraud banks.\n\nHabba said the attorney general\'s team has to prove that there is an intent to defraud lenders. She said that the lenders made money and that they were not defrauded. Habba said that this case could set a dangerous precedent for all business owners in New York state.\n\n""There was no intent to defraud, period, the end,"" she said.\n\nTrump was listening intently as Habba went back and forth with the judge.\n\nNew York civil fraud trial could seriously hamper Trump businesses\n\nTrump returns to court, ignores James\n\nTrump is back in court following the break. He walked past James who was looking in the other direction, so the two did not make eye contact.\n\nOpening statements come to a close sooner than expected\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nThe prosecution and defense have now both concluded their opening statements and the court took a 10-minute break as of 11:40 ET.\n\nBoth Wallace\'s opening statement for the prosecution, as well as Kise\'s for the defense, were shorter than expected, not nearly reaching the two-hour mark they were each allotted.\n\nWithin their time, Wallace and Kise both gave detailed accounts of the president and his company\'s financial statements. There were notable differences in the valuations cited by the two lawyers in their respective statements.\n\nAs the trial took a break, Trump got out of his chair and walked out of the courtroom, bypassing AG James and not even looking at her.\n\nNew York’s lawsuit against Trump is different from his other legal troubles: It’s personal\n\nTrump is no stranger to legal scrutiny, but there’s something different about this $250 million lawsuit: This time, it’s as personal for him as it is political.\n\nJames’ suit strikes directly at Trump’s children and at the core of his persona as a billionaire businessman who left an indelible imprint on New York’s skyline.\n\nThe real estate empire he flaunted was propped up by a network of fraudulent business dealings that played out for years, the suit alleges. If James prevails in court, the former president and three of his children would be banned from serving as officers of companies in New York — the state that gave rise to his global brand.\n\nTrump is already facing a slew of state and federal investigations into his business practices, his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and the removal of sensitive documents from the White House. In all cases, Trump has denied any wrongdoing. Allies say that, if anything, James’ lawsuit will rally Republicans around him.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTrump\'s defense team delivers opening arguments\n\nand\n\nTrump\'s attorney Chris Kise delivered the opening statement for the defense.\n\nHe argued that the defense interprets the evidence differently and that it maintains that Trump made billions of dollars by being right about real estate investments and building one of the most successful real estate empires in the world.\n\nHe said that the evidence demonstrates that there was no intent to defraud and that the loan transactions were ""successful"" and ""profitable,"" saying, ""The banks made well over $100 million.""\n\nKise reiterated that the defense believes that the evidence will show no material fraud. He said that one witness, Eli Bartov, an accounting professor at NYU, will show that there is no such thing as objective valuation and the court will also hear that this agreement is not fraud. There are different ways to value a given property, he said, and that there can be no intent to defraud.\n\nTestimonies of key Trump associates featured prominently during opening statements\n\nand\n\nThe attorney general\'s office showed several depositions previously captured on camera for the case featuring several of Trump\'s family members and former aides.\n\nEric Trump\'s deposition, for example, showed the former president\'s son saying that he doesn\'t remember a video conference talking about the financial conditions and statements. The deposition of Don Jr., the former president\'s eldest son, showed him laughing after he was asked about basic accounting, which he said he probably learned in Accounting 101 at Wharton and that he is not an accountant.\n\nDuring Trump\'s deposition, he was questioned about statements of financial conditions and he was asked if Allen Weisselberg is responsible for it.\n\n""I would say yes,"" Trump said in the deposition.\n\nJames\' office also played the deposition from Michael Cohen in which he was asked about preparing documents and he said he was involved in that process in 2011, 2012 and 2015. Cohen said that Trump wanted to be higher on the Forbes list and Weisselberg would inflate the numbers, and increase the value of assets so that he would appear higher on the list.\n\nPatrick Birney, a vice president at the Trump Organization, said Trump ""likes to see it go up.""\n\nThe AG\'s office\'s opening statements concluded shortly after 11:00 a.m. ET.\n\nHow Trump is reacting to the AG\'s opening statements\n\nand\n\nTrump for the majority of the opening statements stares directly forward, with his hands crossed over his chest, while looking at his desktop monitor with all of the graphics the prosecutor is showing. Wallace is deep into the numbers of the financials that he is accused of manipulating to his benefit.\n\nTrump also tapped his feet and fidgeted from time to time. At one point, he whispers into the ear of his lawyer Chris Kise, who sits to the right of him. He yawned as Kise went to go to the stand for opening statements.\n\nEngoron clarifies how his name is pronounced\n\nThe judge says his name is pronounced ""EN-GORE-ON.""\n\nTrump enters court with Eric Trump, others\n\nAmong those Trump entered the courthouse with today are his lawyer, Alina Habba, strategist Jason Miller and his son Eric Trump.\n\nTrump told reporters as he entered the building, ""There is no crime, the crime is against me.""\n\nJudge denies media request to allow cameras to film opening statements\n\nThe judge denied a request by a group of media companies to allow cameras to film the opening statements.\n\nScenes from the court\n\nand\n\nJames arrived in the courtroom at 9:30 a.m. and greeted each member of the prosecution team.\n\nThe prosecution team arrived in force with about a dozen lawyers as Trump’s lead Secret Service agent surveyed the defense table where the former president will sit. There is tension combined with excitement in the air as the trial begins, with murmurs that Trump’s wife, Melania, is here as well, but this has not been confirmed.\n\nLead Trump attorney Chris Kise exchanged a warm greeting with James, who stood up to greet him. James is in the front row on the right side of the room facing the bench with direct line of sight to where Trump will sit. A court officer is seen sitting next to James.\n\nTrump attorney and spokeswoman Alina Habba is also in attendance, along with several other Trump attorneys who are sitting down in the first row of the gallery. Secret Service agents are seen every few feet around the courtroom, with court officers in white shirts crowded at the entrance.\n\nCourt comes to order\n\nAt about 10:10 a.m., the court was called to order to begin the trial.\n\nTrump arrives at the courthouse\n\nTrump arrived at the courthouse shortly before 10 a.m. ET.\n\nHe delivered remarks to reporters, defending his financial statements and calling the trial ""a continuation of the single greatest witch hunt of all time.""\n\nJames arrives at New York Supreme Court\n\nJames arrived at the New York Supreme Court. Speaking to reporters in front of the court, she referred to the decision from Engoron last week that found Trump and other defendants “have committed persistent and repeated fraud.”\n\n“Today we will prove our other claims,” she said. “My message is simple: No matter how powerful you are, no matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law. And it is my responsibility and my duty and my job to enforce it.”\n\n“The law is both powerful and fragile and today in court we’ll prove our case,” the New York attorney general added. “I thank you all for being here and again justice will prevail.”\n\nTrump releases video statement ahead of court appearance\n\nAhead of his expected court appearance, Trump issued remarks in a video message sent via text to his supporters this morning.\n\n“Our country is in a very dark place right now,” he said. “But even after everything the Deep State has done to me, I will never give up an America. Mark my words: in 2024 we will win back the White House. We will make America great again. I have no doubt about it.”\n\nTrump accused “the RINOs, the communists, the Marxists, the fascists” of unfairly targeting him as he pushed his false claims of a “rigged” 2020 election.\n\n“We will not only survive, we will be stronger than ever before,” he said. “We’re fighting a fight like nobody ever thought possible. And we’re winning.”\n\nJames plans to be in court today\n\nJames plans to be in the courtroom today for the start of the trial, according to a person familiar with her plans. This sets up a potential faceoff between James and Trump, who said he plans to be in the New York County courthouse.\n\nJames alleges some well-known Trump properties were overvalued by the organization\n\nIn her lawsuit against Trump and his company, James alleges the former president issued fraudulent statements that falsely inflated the value of almost two dozen properties and assets owned by him and the Trump Organization.\n\nSome of the assets and tactics allegedly used to inflate their values include:\n\nTrump Tower: Trump’s triplex apartment was valued at 30,000 square feet, but in reality was only 10,996 square feet. The apartment was therefore erroneously valued at $326 million in 2015 — more than three times the value of the most expensive apartment ever sold in New York City, according to the attorney general\'s office.\n\nTrump Park Avenue: Trump allegedly inflated the value of the property in part by valuing rent-stabilized condominium units at market rate and bypassing outside valuations. The AG’s office noted that an outside bank-ordered appraisal valued 12 rent-stabilized units in the building at $750,000 total in 2010. However, the untested were valued at almost $50 million total in 2011 and 2012 statements.\n\nMar-a-Lago: Trump\'s Florida resort was valued as high as $739 million, allegedly based on false claims that it could be developed and sold for residential use. Trump, however, signed deeds donating his residential development rights, restricting changes to the property and limiting the use of the property to a social club, according to the AG’s office.\n\nTrump Aberdeen: The valuation of the golf course, located in Aberdeen, Scotland, was based on the assumption that 2,500 homes could be developed, but the Trump Organization obtained zoning approval to develop fewer than 1,500 cottages and apartments. And many of those were expressly identified solely as short-term rentals, the AG’s office said.\n\nTrump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida: Trump purchased the golf court for $5 million, but less than a year later he valued it at $62 million on the 2013 statement, which amounted to a $1,100% markup. Trump allegedly used several deceptive methods to fraudulently overstate the value of the property, such as adding an additional 30% to its value for the Trump brand in 2013 and 2015, and 15% from 2015 through 2020, according to the AG’s office.\n\nTrump says he\'ll be in court to \'fight for my name and reputation\'\n\nTrump said he will be in court in New York for the start of his civil fraud trial in a post on his Truth Social platform last night.\n\nHe also took aim at James, who brought the $250 million lawsuit against Trump and his company, and Engoron, who will decide the case.\n\n“I’m going to Court tomorrow morning to fight for my name and reputation against a corrupt and racist Attorney General, Letitia James, who campaigned on ‘getting Trump,’ and a Trump Hating Judge who is unfair, unhinged, and vicious in his PURSUIT of me,” Trump wrote.\n\nN.Y. judge ruled Trump committed fraud and lied about net worth for years\n\n+3\n\n, , and\n\nA New York judge ruled in the state attorney general’s $250 million lawsuit against Trump and his company last week that the former president committed repeated acts of fraud for years.\n\nAccording to the ruling, which allowed the civil trial to begin this week, Trump lied to banks and insurers by both overvaluing and undervaluing his assets when it was to his benefit, while exaggerating his net worth to the tune of billions of dollars.\n\nIn his 35-page ruling, Engoron said Trump continually lied on his financial statements and was able to get favorable loan terms and lower insurance premiums as a result. Trump’s legal arguments defending the statements are based in “a fantasy world, not the real world,” he wrote.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTrump civil fraud trial gets underway in New York\n\nA $250 million civil fraud lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office against Trump, his company and two of his adult children is set to go to trial today in a case that could have widespread implications for the former president’s businesses.\n\nThe no-jury trial in Manhattan is expected to last about three months, concluding by Dec. 22, and will be decided by Engoron.\n\nThe ruling, which allowed the case to go to trial this week, will also have practical repercussions for Trump’s numerous limited liability companies, or LLCs. The judge’s order set in motion a dissolution process for entities like Trump Organization LLC, which has helped expand the Trump brand over the years.\n\nRead the full story here.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-witness-list-250-million-civil-fraud-trial-starting-week-rcna117958', 'Headline': 'Trump is on the witness list for $250 million civil fraud trial ...', 'Snippet': ""Former President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in New York on Sept. 6.

The company was convicted and fined $1.6 million.\n\nThe witness list also named Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen as among the 28 witnesses the attorney general’s office intends to call.\n\nIvanka Trump, a former top executive at Trump’s company, was originally a defendant, but a state appeals court found the claims against her were too old and dismissed them.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, who will preside over the jury-less bench trial in Manhattan next week, partly sided with the AG\'s office in a ruling Tuesday when he found that Trump had committed repeated acts of fraud for years. Trump attorney Christopher Kise has said he plans to appeal the ruling, which he characterized as ""outrageous.""\n\nTrump, meanwhile, blasted the judge he\'ll be testifying before as a ""Trump hating"" judge who has violated his civil rights.\n\nThe state Appellate Division — the same appeals court that dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump — had issued a temporary stay of the trial date of Monday after Trump complained that Engoron hadn’t ruled on some of his arguments. Engoron ruled on the issues Tuesday, and the appeals court allowed the case to proceed to trial Monday.\n\nJames has said Cohen, a former Trump loyalist, sparked her office’s investigation when he testified before Congress that Trump routinely exaggerated his assets in financial documents. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal charges of tax evasion, violating campaign finance laws and lying to banks and to Congress, and he was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nTrump has filed a $500 million lawsuit against Cohen in Florida alleging he breached his fiduciary duty to Trump by ""both revealing Plaintiff’s confidences, and spreading falsehoods about Plaintiff."" Lawyers for Cohen were scheduled to depose Trump in Florida next week, but his attorney Alejandro Brito argued in court Thursday that Trump needs to be in New York because of the AG\'s case.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres will hold another hearing Friday to determine whether to keep the date or push it back to Oct. 8 or Oct. 9. There is also a possibility the deposition could be held in New York at Trump’s request, but that would have to be approved by Cohen’s attorney.\n\nA source with knowledge of the situation said the deposition would still happen — it’s just a matter of when and where. Donald Trump’s attorney didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe civil fraud trial that begins next week in Manhattan could last until Dec. 22, the judge has said. In addition to the 28 main witnesses, the AG\'s office listed 25 more people as potential rebuttal witnesses.\n\nTrump\'s witness list, meanwhile, included 127 names of fact and expert witnesses, in addition to ""Any witness included on Plaintiff’s Witness List.""\n\nEngoron said in a ruling this month that he\'ll hear the case five days a week. James’ office will have 90 minutes for an opening statement Monday, while lawyers for the multiple Trump defendants will have two hours.\n\nTrump and his two adult sons have denied any wrongdoing. He has accused James, a Democrat, of taking part in a partisan ""witch hunt"" against him.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/legal/trumps-million-dollar-expert-lost-all-credibility-judge-ny-civil-fraud-trial-2023-12-18/', 'Headline': ""Trump's million-dollar expert 'lost all credibility,' judge in civil ..."", 'Snippet': 'An expert witness paid nearly $1 million by Donald Trump to testify at his New York civil fraud trial ""lost all credibility"" by ""doggedly"" justifying the former U.S. president\'s business records ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1c247874-bca4-408d-a539-93f5f113ce0b', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump delivers heated testimony in New York civil fraud trial', 'Snippet': 'Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie, Trump took the stand just after 10am for the most anticipated moment of a civil trial that began a month ago in the lawsuit brought by New York ...', 'Full_text': 'The new FT Digital Edition: today’s FT, cover to cover on any device.

These proceedings will determine potential penalties.\n\nArriving at court on Monday, Mr Trump maintained that no fraud had taken place.\n\nInstead, the frontrunner for next year\'s Republican presidential nomination characterised the entire trial as a politically motivated attempt at ""election interference"".\n\n""These are political operatives that I\'m going to be dealing with right now,"" he said.

His testimony was expected to give the former president an indirect opportunity to make a case that he shouldn’t face criminal charges over hush money paid to a porn star during his 2016 campaign.\n\nCostello was asked to appear by the Manhattan district attorney’s office after he said he had information raising questions about the credibility of Michael Cohen, a key witness in the investigation, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss secret legal proceedings.\n\nCostello’s appearance is yet another indication that prosecutors are moving to wrap up their probe, with grand jurors presumably being offered an opportunity to consider any testimony or evidence favorable to Trump that could weaken the case for moving forward with an indictment. It was unclear whether Costello’s testimony has any potential to change the course of a grand jury probe that seems close to concluding.\n\nCohen’s lawyer said his client was available for another appearance but was not needed.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump’s calls for protests fail to gain traction ahead of anticipated indictment\n\nThe testimony is coming two days after Trump said he expected to face criminal charges and urged supporters to protest his possible arrest. In a series of social media posts through the weekend, the former Republican president criticized the New York investigation, directing particularly hostile rhetoric toward Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat.\n\nIt’s not clear when prosecutors might wrap up their work, but law enforcement in New York has been making physical preparations for any unrest surrounding a possible indictment. In the morning, a New York Police Department truck began dropping off portable metal barricades that could be used to block off streets or sidewalks.\n\nEven as the New York investigation pushes toward conclusion, Trump faces criminal probes in Atlanta and Washington that, taken together, pose significant legal peril and carry the prospect of upending a Republican presidential race in which Trump remains a leading contender. Some of his likely opponents have tried to strike a balance between condemning a potential prosecution as politically motivated while avoiding condoning the conduct at issue.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an expected GOP presidential candidate, criticized the investigation but also threw one of his first jabs at the former president in a move likely to intensify their simmering political rivalry.\n\n“I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some kind of alleged affair,” DeSantis said at a news conference in Panama City. “I can’t speak to that.”\n\nBut, he added, “what I can speak to is that if you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction and he chooses to go back many, many years ago to try to use something about porn star hush money payments, that’s an example of pursuing a political agenda and weaponizing the office. And I think that’s fundamentally wrong.”\n\nNEWS WRAP: Trump says he expects to be arrested by New York authorities\n\nMike Pence, the former vice president who’s expected to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination, castigated Trump in an ABC News interview last weekend as “reckless” for his actions on Jan. 6 and said history would hold him accountable. Even so, he echoed the former president’s rhetoric that an indictment would be a “politically charged prosecution.”\n\n“I have no doubt that President Trump knows how to take care of himself,” Pence said. “And he will. But that doesn’t make it right to have a politically charged prosecution of a former president.”\n\nCostello briefly acted as a legal adviser to Cohen after the FBI raided Cohen’s home and apartment in 2018. At the time, Cohen was being investigated for both tax evasion and for payments he helped orchestrate in 2016 to buy the silence of two women who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump.\n\nFor several months, it was unclear whether Cohen, a longtime lawyer and fixer for the Trump Organization who once boasted that he would “take a bullet” for his boss, would remain loyal to the president.\n\nCohen ultimately decided to plead guilty in connection with the payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, which he said were directed by Trump. Since then, he has been a vociferous Trump critic, testifying before Congress and then to the Manhattan grand jury.\n\nTrump, who has denied having sex with either woman, has branded Cohen a liar. Costello broke with Cohen before he pleaded guilty, after it became clear he was no longer in Trump’s camp.\n\nIn the years since, Costello, a veteran New York attorney, has represented Trump allies including his former political strategist Steve Bannon and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nTucker reported from Washington.

Can’t do it.”\n\nHe continued: “For God’s sake, whose side are you on? Whose side are you on? Look, you’re either on the side of a mob or the side of the police. You can’t be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. You can’t be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6th ‘patriots’. You can’t do it.”\n\nTwo days later, Mr Biden gave a primetime address in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the Constitution was drafted.\n\n“Too much of what’s happening in our country today is not normal,” he said, adding that the man he defeated nearly two years ago – former president Mr Trump – and his “Maga Republican” allies “represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic”.\n\n“That is a threat to this country,” he continued.\n\nIt’s not the first time crowd-size comparisons are part of the political conversation.\n\nPerhaps the first scandal of the Trump White House involved the then-president and his aides making dubious claims about the crowd size at Mr Trump’s January 2017 inauguration.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://heavy.com/news/trump-florence-arizona-rally-crowd-photos-2022/', 'Headline': ""How Many Attended Trump's Arizona Rally?

Meanwhile, Liz Willis of the right-wing network RSBN had indicated during the rally that attendance was about 20,000, according to a tweet that her official account retweeted. The Town of Florence Police Department had written on January 13 that they projected an attendance of close to 30,000.\n\nSteven Monacelli of Rolling Stone, The Daily Beast, and Dallas Weekly tweeted that when he arrived at the rally, he and other members of the press were told the press tower was full, even while others were still being let in the gates.\n\nHe later shared that although some of the press who were with him weren’t allowed inside, he was able to get into the rally.\n\nEd Henry of the conservative publication Real America’s Voice shared these photos of the crowd.\n\nWill Steakin of ABC News tweeted that Anthony Kern, a former Arizona lawmaker who was at the Capitol on January 6, addressed the crowd before Trump and told the rally: “This is our 1776 movement.”\n\nSteakin said the crowd could be heard saying “lock him up” at one point, in reference to Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nHere’s another crowd photo, shared by Monacelli on Twitter:\n\nDuring Trump’s speech, he called Biden “a disaster” for the country and let Kari Lake join him briefly on the stage.

A brand-new conspiracy theory? But you can always rely on the former president to brag about the size of the crowd. He will remark happily upon the gridlocked traffic getting into the event. He will exclaim that he cannot even pinpoint exactly where the crowd ends. And periodically, he will demand that videographers pivot their cameras around to capture the full extent of his devoted following.\n\nFor Donald Trump and his supporters, crowd size is more than just a bragging point. It’s proof that they are part of the American majority. “A person that comes here and has crowds that go further than the eye can see … and has cars that stretch out for 25 miles, that’s not somebody that lost an election,” Trump told the crowd at his rally in Florence, Arizona, on Saturday.\n\nBefore the 2020 election, Trump and his fans would often ask reporters how Joe Biden could possibly win when he didn’t have rallies as big as Trump’s. Now that Biden is president, Trump-rally goers say things like Trump couldn’t really have lost. Look at all of these people! In Arizona this weekend, 51-year-old Tammy Shutts put it this way to me: “100 percent, 1,000 percent, 1 million percent Biden didn’t win” her state, she said, gesturing to the hordes of people around her. “I’ve been in Arizona for almost 21 years. There is no way—no way—we went blue.”\n\nMany American liberals live in political bubbles. Some people in overwhelmingly blue parts of the country, for example, were shocked to find that Trump got so many votes in 2016. (“I live in a rather special world. I only know one person who voted for [Richard] Nixon,” the film critic Pauline Kael famously said of the former president, acknowledging her own political bubble just weeks after Nixon smashed George McGovern in 1972.) Some of those same blue-area Democrats were just as confident that Senator Elizabeth Warren would be the party nominee. But Republicans also live in bubbles.\n\nHuman beings aren’t particularly comfortable hearing information that challenges our closely held beliefs, and the urge to reject evidence that goes against our political opinions is especially strong. Reading only certain websites or watching particular TV channels shields Americans from facts and opinions they don’t like, and geographic sorting protects partisans from unpleasant interactions with people who hold different beliefs. Political segregation in America has increased dramatically in the past decade. “For about one in five Republicans, and two in five Democrats, less than a quarter of their neighbors belong to the opposite political party,” according to a recent study published in Nature. In other words, Trump voters might find it hard to believe that Biden won the election because their neighbors and friends mostly voted for Trump too.\n\nTrump’s rallies amplify these phenomena, Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard who co-wrote the Nature study, told me. “You have the president saying things, your neighbors who you [perceive as] saying the same things, and then these Trump rallies seem to be almost a social event,” he said. “Now you have an element of your social life, not just what you’re seeing on TV, that is caught up in believing these lies.” When you’re literally surrounded by believers, it’s hard to remember that doubters exist. Inside Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, for example, it can seem like the whole world is made up of Hawkeyes fans. Fortunately, that’s not true.

Within minutes of taking the stage Saturday, after he bragged about crowd size, Trump claimed the “proof is all over the place” that the election was stolen (it was not). “The big lie is a lot of bullshit,” Trump said accurately, though not in the way he thinks.\n\n“I ran twice, I won twice. … We did much better the second time,” Trump falsely claimed while referencing an election he definitively lost. “The people are hungry for the truth. They want their country back.” Encouraging the crowd to vote, Trump told them, “Get out and vote. Make sure it’s not a rigged vote, please.” At one point, Trump pulled Arizona gubernatorial candidate and former news anchor Kari Lake onstage, where she proclaimed without irony that the founding fathers would have supported Trump, the president who subverted democracy and the rule of law at almost every opportunity.\n\n“Look at the people, as far as the eye can see,” Trump said, returning to boasting about attendance. “Way back, I mean, football fields back. … Nobody’s ever had a movement like this. Nobody’s ever had spirit like this or a crowd like this.” Later in the speech, Trump circled back to crowd size, marveling at the number of people at the Capitol on Jan. 6 — lauding a crowd that threatened elected lawmakers who were conducting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of power. He then pushed a conspiracy theory favored by Steve Bannon, as well as far-right GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz, that the federal government was behind the Jan. 6 violence.\n\nThe former president also bashed Dr. Anthony Fauci as the audience erupted into a chorus of “Lock him up! Lock him up!” Fauci, at a congressional hearing this week, spoke emotionally about how his family faces persistent death threats because of the way the Republican Party has demonized him.\n\nEven before the former president took the stage, a parade of cronies warmed up the crowd with religious overtones, a promise to jail Fauci, and unfounded allegations of election fraud. Mike Lindell — the “My Pillow Guy”-turned-election-fraud-investigator — promised that the 2020 presidential election would be overturned. Explaining why Trump hadn’t yet been gloriously returned to his rightful place in the White House, Lindell said that it would happen on “God’s timing, not our timing.” Lindell then made a seemingly impossible claim: that the entire 2022 election will be conducted manually and, presumably, will be hand counted. “I will promise you this, there’s not going to be any election done with machines or computers done in 2022,” Lindell said. Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) didn’t make that same promise, but he did inject “Let’s go, Brandon,” into his speech.\n\nThe rally, much like the one that preceded it, was a rehash of the Big Lie, the same dangerous rhetoric that encouraged Trump’s supporters to launch a violent attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, posing a real threat to our democracy. But the attempted coup failed, dooming Trump to holding rallies and feeding his supporters a steady stream of bullshit to keep them fired up for the midterms and his potential 2024 run. After all, supporters will continue to show up and treat him as the god emperor they believe him to be.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/09/trump-arizona-kari-lake-blake-masters-election-rally/8209439001/', 'Headline': 'Trump in Arizona: Recap from Kari Lake, Blake Masters rally in Mesa', 'Snippet': ""The event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November's election.

Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar and Debbie Lesko, as well as GOP challengers Eli Crane and Kelly Cooper. Trump notably didn’t mention Rep. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani, who is the GOP nominee in a Tucson-area district.\n\nAfter doing so, Trump again turned to the dark imagery of an America in chaos because of Democratic policies. He complained of inflation and declining stocks, dead U.S. soldiers and wasted hardware in Afghanistan and with Ukraine at war.\n\n“We are a nation in decline,” Trump said near the end of his speech as sorrowful sounding music played. “We are a nation that in many ways has become a joke.”\n\n“But we are not going to allow this horror to continue,” he said. “It is hard-working patriots like you who are going to save this country.”\n\nBy the time Trump was ending his speech, many in the crowd already had walked away.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n6:40 p.m.: Trump ends speech in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has concluded his remarks at a rally in Mesa. Trump spoke for more than 90 minutes, airing many of the grievances he has repeated for years, while also giving attention to Republican candidates that he is backing in the state.\n\n6:10 p.m.: Trump says World War III could happen soon\n\nThe planet could be on the verge of World War III, former President Donald Trump said Sunday, blaming the Biden administration for failing to avert the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the spiraling tensions over it.\n\nWith characteristic self-congratulation, Trump praised himself for being correct about “everything” but said he hopes he is wrong that another global war could be on the horizon.\n\n“We must demand immediate negotiation of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine or we will end up in World War III, and there will never be a war like this. We will never have had a war like this, and that’s all because of stupid people that don’t have a clue. And it’s also because of the kind of weaponry that’s available today.”\n\nTrump castigated Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as a reliable vote for ill-considered legislation pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nMore than 45 minutes into his remarks, Trump returned repeatedly to claims of a stolen election in 2020. He called 2020 a “rigged and stolen election.”\n\n“I ran twice. I won twice,” Trump said.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen and Alison Steinbach\n\n5:55 p.m.: Trump claims predecessors took classified records\n\nFormer President Donald Trump unloaded on the FBI and accused his presidential predecessors over the criminal investigation of the documents seized from his residence at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe alluded to a third presidential run that won’t get derailed by what he views as politically motivated attacks on him.\n\n“What they’re trying to do is take us out so we can’t represent you if we decide to do that, but we’ll be making a decision very soon,” he said to rising cheers.\n\nTrump claimed that former President Bill Clinton took millions of classified records with him when he left office, and presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama also improperly took records as well.\n\nClinton lost the nuclear codes and former President Jimmy Carter sent the nuclear codes to a dry cleaner, Trump said, adding that nothing happened in those matters.\n\n“Lock her up! Lock her up!” the crowd chanted after Trump mentioned former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton kept private from officials government emails.\n\n“They should give me back everything that was taken,” Trump said of the records taken by the FBI.\n\n“They plant documents,” he said of the FBI. Trump wondered aloud when the Clintons would face investigation and prosecution.\n\n“I don’t think they will do it, and I don’t think they should do it,” Trump said.\n\nDespite his complaints, Trump said the actions against him drove his poll numbers higher.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5:30 p.m.: Trump starts speech with familiar topics\n\nFormer President Donald Trump wasted no time on Sunday launching into familiar grievances and a bleak image of America without him in the White House.\n\nCiting the influx of illegal immigrants, soaring prices and arrests of people who oppose abortion, Trump hit President Joe Biden and Democrats generally for a country in turmoil.\n\n“These are incredible people. They’re being treated like terrorists,” Trump said, vaguely alluding to those who support him or conservative causes.\n\n“Nothing happens to antifa. Nothing happens to (Black Lives Matter). But look at what happens to patriots. The Democrats are locking up their political opponents,"" he said.\n\nTrump put himself and his many controversies as the central evidence of Democrats abusing their power to hurt Republican opponents.\n\nHe complained of impeachment over what he again referred to a “perfect phone call” where he tied approval of military aid to Ukraine to that country declaring an investigation of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHe described his conversation with Georgia election officials that is under criminal investigation “an absolutely perfect phone call.”\n\nWithin seconds of taking the stage, Trump had complained about the media, alluded to his baseless claims of a stolen election and hinted that more elections could lie ahead.\n\n“We won it big and we won it a second time,” Trump said early on.\n\nHe took the stage in sun-splashed Mesa an hour later than scheduled, though those in the crowd of perhaps 5,000 at the event had stuck around without any obvious complaints.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5 p.m.: Trump takes the stage in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump started speaking to the crowd in Mesa just before 5 p.m. Sunday, about an hour later than scheduled. He started his remarks by repeating his false claim that he won Arizona in 2020 and went on the attack against Democrats.\n\n4:50 p.m.: Lake fires up crowd, but doesn\'t mention 2020 election\n\nRepublican candidate for Arizona governor Kari Lake, the former television news anchor, spoke for 18 minutes on Sunday — without once mentioning the 2020 election and the false claims about it that propelled her to political prominence.\n\nInstead, Lake painted her Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs as an absent candidate who refused to debate her, while Lake has toured the state speaking directly to voters. She connected Hobbs to the Biden administration, claiming Hobbs would raise taxes on Arizonans already feeling the brunt of record-high inflation. Hobbs has said she does not plan to do so, and either candidate would need the Legislature’s agreement to change tax policy.\n\nLake repeatedly noted a discrimination case Hobbs was involved in while Hobbs was the Democratic leader in the state Senate. A Black female Democratic staffer proved to two juries she was discriminated against and fired in retaliation by Hobbs and others after raising an issue over her pay disparity.\n\nThose verdicts, Lake said, showed Hobbs had already embarrassed the state and should not lead it. Her attacks prompted cheers from the crowd.\n\n“They’re saying lock her up,” Lake said. “I think we should just vote her out, how’s that?”\n\nLake proved victorious in August’s four-way primary election with the backing of Trump, who remains polarizing in politics. And though claims about the 2020 election being stolen or corrupt are a hallmark of her campaign — she has said she wouldn’t have certified Biden’s win in the state two years ago — she didn’t mention them Sunday.\n\nInstead, she pledged a crackdown at the border to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking and talked about economic hardship facing Arizonans. In a new policy proposal, Lake said she would work to prohibit municipalities from collecting taxes on groceries and rent. Doing both would require the Legislature to pass a bill.\n\n“It is said hard times create strong men, well they create strong women too,” she said. “And this woman is ready to put an end to the hard times. Who is ready to step up with me?”\n\nThe crowd chanted back: “Kari! Kari! Kari!”\n\n4 p.m.: Finchem promises changes to voting if elected secretary of state\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem’s walk-on music at the Mesa rally was the theme from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" To further his Western bona fides, and to take a swipe at East Coast commentators who mock his western vibe, Finchem wore his cowboy hat and sported his “Sunday Go-To Meeting Tie.“\n\nHe launched into his familiar attack on his Democratic opponent for secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, from Fontes’ missteps during the 2020 Democratic presidential preference election to his support of all-mail voting to policy changes that were slapped down by court rulings.\n\n“Just follow the law” is his campaign mantra, and he said he will stick to the rules.\n\nAs secretary of state, Finchem said he will push for post-election audits in all 15 counties and disconnect Arizona from ERIC, the Electronic Registration Information Center, which shares voter information among states to ensure there is not double voting.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n3:40 p.m.: Masters continues to pound Kelly over border, drugs, crime\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued his aggressive attacks on Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., saying he should have to attend the funerals of overdose victims killed by drugs that entered America from its porous borders.\n\nMasters rattled off a familiar list of complaints about current conditions: There are 300,000 people crossing the nation’s border each month, violent crime has soared in Phoenix since 2019 and fentanyl continues to kill Americans everywhere.\n\n“Mark Kelly has been radio silent about fentanyl for 22 months,” Masters said. That ended last week, Masters said, because he had a debate with Masters.\n\n“One month before Election Day, he says, ‘Uh oh. I better pretend to start doing something about fentanyl,’” Masters said, adding that 2,000 Arizonans have died from the drug in the past year.\n\n“I think Mark Kelly should have to attend the funerals. Let him look a grieving mother in the eye and he can explain to her why he failed to even lift a finger to secure our border,” Masters said.\n\nHis words extend attacks on Kelly that shot to prominence last week during the debate between the Senate candidates.\n\nMasters took the stage to “Danger Zone,” the song made famous in both installments of the movie “Top Gun” that is about Navy pilots. It would seem a curious choice. Kelly was a Navy fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut, while Masters never served in the military.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n3 p.m.: Hamadeh, Lesko describe a country in turmoil\n\nAbe Hamadeh, a Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona attorney general, characterized Arizona as on the front lines of defending America in a short speech at the rally in Mesa.\n\n“Arizona, we shocked the hell out of the establishment on Aug. 2, and are you ready to do it again?” Hamadeh said to loud applause.\n\nHamadeh said Democrats have harmed the country in the past couple years, citing inflation, drugs and “terrorists” crossing the border with Mexico, critical race theory in schools, censorship from big tech and Democrats who are “weaponizing the law and targeting patriots.”\n\n“Arizona is on the front lines of so many of the battles facing our country, and if we lose Arizona, we lose our country, but we’re not going to lose. We’re not going to lose because President Trump is still fighting for America,” he said.\n\nAs attorney general, Hamadeh said he would fight criminals, drug cartels and the federal government and “lock up some people and put handcuffs on them,” prompting cheers in the crowd of “lock them up.”\n\n“America has been down before, but America has never been out. The rest of the country is watching, they’re watching what we do right here in Arizona, because if we win, there’s still hope for America. And when we win, when we win, Arizona will lead America’s greatest comeback and never look back,"" he said.\n\nThe dark imagery was a theme among speakers.\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., described a dystopian America on the verge of collapse in the hands of Democrats in her remarks Sunday.\n\nInflation, a “totally open border,” fentanyl and violent crime have surged under President Joe Biden with help from congressional Democrats, Lesko told the crowd in Mesa.\n\nAnd authorities have hounded Trump since he began his political career, she said.\n\n“They continue to go after President Trump for six years,” she said, also lamenting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “to take away our rights” presumably during the pandemic.\n\n“If our country is going to survive, this has got to stop,” Lesko said.\n\n— Alison Steinbach and Ronald J. Hansen\n\n2:40 p.m.: Republicans rally with Katie Hobbs in Paradise Valley\n\nDemocratic candidate for governor Katie Hobbs held a brief news conference Sunday morning at Barry Goldwater Memorial Park in Paradise Valley to emphasize that Republicans should support her over rival Kari Lake.\n\nSeveral members of Hobbs’ “Republicans for Katie Hobbs Coalition” gathered with her at the park, which celebrates the state’s conservative icon who died in 1998 following five terms as a U.S. senator.\n\nKarie Dozer, a former spokesman for the late state Attorney General Grant Woods, said Goldwater would be “shaking his head in disgust” at how “crazy” Republican politics have become.\n\nKari Lake is “dangerous for Arizona,” said Mesa Mayor John Giles, and that’s why he — a Republican — was at the park with Hobbs and not at Trump’s rally in Mesa on Sunday.\n\n“Those of us who support Secretary Hobbs care very deeply about the future of Arizona,” he said. “And that’s why we are putting our state above our party.”\n\nNovember’s election wasn’t between Republicans and Democrats, but “a choice between sanity and chaos,” he added.\n\nMonica Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, describing herself as a former Republican, emphasized that the nation has “moved forward” under Biden.\n\nShe didn’t leave the party, she said — it left her when it began running “candidates operating from places of hatred, hubris and hostility rather than honesty, humility and humanity.”\n\nHobbs, repeating Giles’ statement about “sanity” and “chaos,” said the problem isn’t just that Lake “proudly accepts support from Nazis and spews dang conspiracy theories, it’s what she would actually do as governor.”\n\nHobbs then ran down a litany of Lake’s positions, including her support for a territorial-era anti-abortion law, baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, and surveillance cameras in public-school classrooms.\n\nLake’s entire platform “boils down into being a sore loser,” she said.\n\nOther Republicans at the event included former Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana and former state legislator Steve May.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n2 p.m.: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appears at rally\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., echoed the language of the Great Replacement theory popular with white nationalists in her message to Arizonans in Mesa on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking about illegal immigration, Greene said 5 million people have crossed the Mexican border with impunity from a derelict President Joe Biden.\n\n“Five million people from all over the world have crossed our borders,” Greene said. “Joe Biden’s 5 million illegal aliens are on the verge of replacing you, replacing your jobs, replacing your kids in school, and coming from all over the world they are also replacing your culture. That’s not great for America.”\n\nThe replacement theory is an idea first popular among white nationalists that Democrats want illegal immigrants to keep their party politically viable.\n\nSome Republicans have flirted with similar rhetoric to energize their base, which has long seen the border as dangerously porous.\n\nGreene has long pushed a nationalist message. Last year, Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., were briefly linked to creating an America First Caucus that was reportedly linked to preserving the nation’s Anglo-Saxon past and dramatically restricting the nation’s immigration laws. Both lawmakers quickly distanced themselves from the caucus idea after bipartisan pushback.\n\nBefore taking the stage, Greene predicted the shifting state of Arizona’s law on abortion rights would not play a significant role in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe state’s guiding law seems to have whipsawed between a Civil War-era law that bans nearly all abortions and a law passed earlier this year that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDespite the conflicting rulings and the attention it brings back to the issue, Greene said it won’t have an impact on voting in Arizona.\n\n“I don’t think it’s distracting at all,” she told a reporter before taking the stage in Mesa. Instead, America-first themes, like those identified by Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters, will resonate with voters, she said.\n\nGreene said she is looking forward to Republicans winning back the House of Representatives after the November elections. When that happens, she said, she will be placed on the House Oversight Committee, where she plans to open investigations into Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s embattled son.\n\nGreene also said Big Tech will face scrutiny over its “collusion” with Democrats in 2020 to censor conservative voices.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n1:45 p.m.: Trump, Lake supporters travel from Arizona, out of state\n\nAs the prayer, pledge of allegiance and national anthem began shortly before 1:30 p.m., attendees were still streaming into the dirt lot at Bell Bank Park. Seats were filled in the relatively small area of floor seating and risers around the speaking platform.\n\nAfter the national anthem, a chant of “USA, USA, USA” rose through the crowd. Many wore Trump attire, some wore anti-Biden clothes, and lots wore red, white and blue apparel, including a few people draped in American or Arizona flags.\n\nA few people were carried out on stretchers; it was a hot and sunny afternoon.\n\n“We’re just real Trump people,” said Ann-Marie Villicana, who drove from Pasadena, California, on Saturday to see Trump on Sunday.\n\nVillicana said she founded LA Trump and was a delegate from California in 2016. One of her friends is working with Lake so she came out to show support.\n\n“Since we haven’t been able to get out to Arizona to help Kari Lake, we thought the least we could do was donate money, get great seats,” she said. She and Robin Salzer had VIP seats.\n\n“People are just fed up and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” Salzer said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Schafer of Chandler voted for Trump and is a big supporter but said she hadn’t gone to one of his events until Sunday.\n\n“I am brokenhearted that America is in the condition it’s in,” she said, adding that she’s concerned about issues like inflation, the 2nd Amendment and school curriculum.\n\nSchaefer was excited to hear from Trump and Lake in particular. “I’m 100% Trumpster, I’m 100% Kari Lake,” she said, wearing a Trump shirt and hat. She said the midterm election will be “honest” because so many more people are paying attention.\n\nMaria Foshay traveled from Rancho Cucamonga, California, to hear Trump speak. She hopes he’ll announce his next move during the speech, ideally that he’ll run for president again in 2024. Foshay wants to make sure the election is truthful, fair and with “no cheating.”\n\nKerry Josey of Mesa said Trump is “the face of the people,” adding that she’s been to three of his rallies. She’s concerned about whether the upcoming election will be truthful.\n\nKathy Elgin stood out in the sea of red-colored couture with her eye-catching Oregon Women for Trump-shirt. She and four friends flew in from Oregon for a quick turnaround trip solely for Trump.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” Elgin said.\n\nA resident of Salem, Elgin said Oregon was a red state “until we got mail-in voting.” Since then, she said, the state has turned blue and she doesn’t buy it.\n\nAn avid Trump follower, Elgin said she got a visit from FBI after returning from the Jan. 6 rally at the U.S. Capitol. She called the visit “audacious” explaining that she never witnessed any violence at the Capitol until she saw television footing.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, Eryka Forquer and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n12 p.m.: Who is scheduled to speak at Trump rally in Mesa\n\nThe speaker list for Sunday\'s rally includes names familiar to Arizonans, as well as some of the more outspoken Trump advocates, including U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nTwo members of Arizona\'s congressional delegation are on board to address the rally: Republican representatives Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko.\n\nThey will join former Trump administration staffers Rich Grenell and Kash Patel, who were with Trump at a similar rally in Nevada on Saturday.\n\nGrenell served briefly as acting director of National Intelligence in 2020, while also holding the posts of U.S. ambassador to Germany and special presidential envoy for the Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations.\n\nPatel was former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nThe event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November\'s election. Arizona candidates slated to speak are gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. U.S. Senate nominee Blake Masters, secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem and attorney general nominee Abe Hamedeh.\n\nThe speeches are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n11 a.m.: Masters: \'This race is winnable\'\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued what amounted to a victory lap ahead of his rally with former President Donald Trump in Mesa later today.\n\nMasters appeared with Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" on Fox News and made the case that his showing in Thursday\'s debate with Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., had reversed the race.\n\n""I expected him to struggle to defend (his record in the Senate) and he did,"" Masters said of Kelly. ""All I had to do, Maria, was go out there and tell the truth. Explain to the people how Mark Kelly has kept our border wide open, how his votes for all the crazy trillions of dollars in spending have caused inflation.""\n\n""I think we had him on the ropes a little bit, and it\'s a huge vibe shift, a momentum shift for our campaign,"" he continued.\n\nAsked about the lack of financial investment from some conservative corners, Masters predicted, ""a lot more people are going to get involved.""\n\n""I think I showed people that this race is winnable, that I\'m a much, much better candidate than Sen. Kelly in that debate the other night.""\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n10 a.m.: Lake and Hobbs on national TV prior to Trump rally\n\nArizona’s candidates for governor appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation morning news show Sunday, just hours ahead of Trump’s visit to the state.\n\nThe former president wasn’t the focus of the discussion; instead, Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs and Republican nominee Kari Lake discussed their plans for border security, abortion and other issues, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nThe interviews, conducted separately and aired back to back, might be the closest equivalent to a debate a national audience will see this cycle. They highlighted the stylistic and policy differences of two women locked in a nationally watched race that most polls say is tied.\n\nLake has shifted from praising a near-total ban on abortion to saying she will follow the law. She did so again Sunday. Arizona has two conflicting laws on the books, but a court ruling Friday has allowed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks except for in medical emergencies to prevail.\n\nLake told CBS news correspondent Major Garrett the “law right now as it stands is Gov. Ducey\'s law at 15 weeks, so we\'ll follow the law,” according to a transcript of the interview.\n\nGarrett likewise tried to pin down Hobbs’ position on abortion, which Lake has painted as extreme because Hobbs has repeatedly declined to say if there is a stage of pregnancy after which she thinks abortion should be prohibited. Pressed on that, Garrett asked Hobbs if an Arizona voter would be right to conclude that she does “not favor any specific week limit on abortion.”\n\n“I support leaving the decision between a woman and her doctor and leaving politicians entirely out of it,” Hobbs replied.\n\nLake spent much of her interview talking about her plan to use state law enforcement as border patrol and deportation officers, an authority she’d seek using an untested legal theory that would buck decades of court precedent and likely lead to a lawsuit.\n\n“I hope that Joe Biden doesn\'t fight us because then it would really look like he is on the side of the cartel,” she said.\n\nLake didn’t mention Trump in her interview, perhaps a reflection of his unpopularity with voters nationally. Hobbs brought up the former president twice, attacking his record at the southern border and his false claims the 2020 election was “stolen,” which Lake has parroted.\n\nHobbs said Trump’s effort to build the border wall, the signature of his border policy, wasn’t finished and called on the Biden administration to “step up.”\n\nAsked why she wouldn’t debate Lake, and if her decision not to participate shortchanged voters of a chance to see how Hobbs would respond in a moment of duress, Hobbs shifted to Trump.\n\n“I think the voters of Arizona have had a chance to see how I work under crisis throughout my leadership during the 2020 election as secretary of state,” Hobbs said, “when we had to combat multiple election challenges from former President Trump and his band of election deniers, including my opponent Kari Lake.""\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n9 a.m.: 17 visits and counting\n\nArizona\'s political preeminence seems like a given these days, but the red state-turned-purple battleground coincides almost perfectly with the political rise of Donald Trump.\n\nThe former president found early enthusiasm for his America-first message in Arizona in 2015, and he never really stopped coming back.\n\nHis scheduled rally in Mesa will add to an Arizona total no president or presidential contender can rival, with big asterisks for Barry Goldwater and John McCain, who lived in the state while pursuing the White House.\n\nAccording to Republic research, Trump has made at least 17 visits since entering politics.\n\nThat is a list that began on July 11, 2015, with a stop in Phoenix that focused on immigration and helped set the tone for his upstart campaign.\n\nBy the end of the 2016 campaign, Trump made six more stops in Arizona. He carried the state by 3.5 percentage points, an unusually low margin in a state that had voted Republican in all but one presidential election beginning in 1952.\n\nTrump visited the state seven times in 2020. That included a Feb. 19, 2020, rally in Phoenix just weeks before the pandemic halted campaign visits for months.\n\nIn May 2020, Trump started to move about again, with a stop at a Phoenix Honeywell facility making respirator masks to cope with the health crisis and to discuss aid to Native Americans.\n\nHe wound up losing Arizona in 2020 by fewer than 11,000 votes, the smallest margin in the country.\n\nTrump made his first post-presidential visit to Arizona on July 24, 2021, at a Turning Point Action rally in Phoenix in which he saw firsthand the raucous reception to Kari Lake by Republicans.\n\nHe wrongly predicted the ongoing review of Maricopa County ballots would vindicate his baseless claims of a stolen election.\n\nThis year, Trump held a January rally in Florence, a pre-primary rally in Prescott Valley in July and is set now to again back his slate of Republicans on Sunday in Mesa.\n\n— Ronald J.

Doug Ducey for rebuffing his entreaties to overturn Biden’s victory in Arizona, has heartily embraced Lake’s candidacy.', 'Full_text': 'There is perhaps nowhere in the country where former President Donald Trump had more success elevating his slate of “Make American Great Again” candidates into formidable 2022 contenders than Arizona, a state he narrowly lost in 2020 where he has relentlessly sought to overturn the presidential election results.\n\nWith less than a month until Election Day, Trump campaigned in Mesa on Sunday with those hand-selected GOP candidates vying for the top offices in the state: Gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake, US Senate nominee Blake Masters and Secretary of State nominee Mark Finchem.\n\nAll three rose to the top of their fields during the primary contests – in a state where Trump acolytes have asserted their control over the Republican Party – by echoing Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election to varying degrees.\n\nThat has made Arizona the most closely watched laboratory for democracy in the midterm contests, as Trump weighs another presidential run in 2024, setting up a fresh test of the nation’s election apparatus and the strength of democratic institutions.\n\nIn the near-term, the Senate race could be pivotal to control of the chamber in 2023. But looking forward, Arizona’s status as a battleground state means it could determine the next occupant of the White House, which is why the Democratic opponents of Lake and Finchem – along with Wyoming GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the House select committee probing January 6, 2021 – have warned that their ascent to the state’s highest offices could lead to meddling with the 2024 election results, creating what Cheney recently framed as a test of the “future functioning of our constitutional republic.” In Arizona, the secretary of state is second in line to the governorship.\n\nOn Sunday night, Trump called on Arizona to produce a “clean sweep of every statewide office for the Republican Party” in November.\n\n“You can prove that Arizona is still a red state, and you are,” Trump said, during a speech where he once again falsely claimed he won Arizona in 2020.\n\nThe former President also waded into the abortion debate, reiterating that he favors exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, but also stating that he favors a ban at 15 weeks, a version of which Arizona’s GOP governor has signed, and bringing the issue “back into the states.”\n\nNationally, the question of where limits should be set on abortion has divided the GOP, particularly after South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham proposed a 15-week national ban.\n\nDemocrats hope the debate will weigh in their favor in November since many independent and moderate voters who opposed the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade believe the most restrictive state measures are too extreme. But Trump’s comments on Sunday night may offer some cover for Republican candidates who were struggling to articulate their stance.\n\nThree competitive races\n\nTrump offered glowing praise for Lake, and when he invited her on stage to speak, she managed to create her own moment by telling the crowd that she’s defied “know-nothing consultants” who have advised her to distance from Trump to win her race in a purple state.\n\n“Wouldn’t it be horrible? What would it say about my character if I stepped away from my friends?” Lake said. “If I step away from my friends, that means I would step away from you and I will never step away from the people of Arizona.”\n\n“So, for those know-nothing consultants and the media, I want to show you what it looks like when I step away from President Trump,” she continued, then theatrically hugged him in front of the cameras.\n\nLake, Masters and Finchem are all in tight contests for the seats they are seeking, according to new CNN polling in the Grand Canyon state.\n\nThey are benefiting in part from the fact that a plurality of Arizona voters are registered as Republicans, but also from the fact that election denialism does not rank as the top concern for the state’s voters as they grapple with the impact of inflation, high gas prices and economic turbulence in a climate that should favor the GOP.\n\nThere is no clear leader in the gubernatorial race between Lake and Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who gained national prominence by opposing the efforts of Trump-aligned GOP lawmakers in Arizona to repeatedly wage partisan audits and challenge the 2020 election results. (There is no evidence of widespread election fraud, and the so-called audit confirmed Biden’s victory.) About 49% of likely voters backed Hobbs, while 46% backed Lake in CNN’s new poll.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly is narrowly leading Masters 51% to 45% among likely voters in the Senate race; and there is no clear leader in the race between Finchem and Democrat Adrian Fontes, the former recorder of Maricopa County who was defeated in his 2020 reelection bid after facing criticism for some of the changes he made to the county’s voting systems.\n\nTrump, who repeatedly targeted Arizona’s term-limited GOP Gov. Doug Ducey for rebuffing his entreaties to overturn Biden’s victory in Arizona, has heartily embraced Lake’s candidacy. The former Arizona news anchor, who has repeatedly referred to the 2020 election as “stolen” and “corrupt,” has raised money at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida. During a GOP primary debate this year, she said she would not have certified the 2020 presidential election results in Arizona as Ducey did (and as is required by law).\n\nDucey declined national Republicans’ efforts to get him to run for Senate this year, leaving a crowded field of candidates jockeying for Trump’s support. Trump eventually backed Masters, who had the support of conservative tech billionaire Peter Thiel in the primary, and had released a campaign video stating he believed Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nBut during an Arizona Senate debate last week where Kelly warned that the “wheels” could “come off our democracy” if candidates like his opponent are elected, Masters modulated his tone on the 2020 election results – part of a clear play by the venture capitalist to appeal to a broader swath of the Arizona electorate. Under questioning from the moderator he conceded that he had not seen evidence of fraud in the 2020 vote counting or election results in a way that would have changed the outcome.\n\nAfter his primary victory in August, he also scrubbed his website of language that included the false claim that the election was stolen.\n\nNeither Lake nor Masters mentioned the 2020 election in their remarks Sunday in Mesa before Trump arrived. But Lake, who is executing a Trump playbook by focusing her efforts on boosting GOP base turnout in Arizona, has not attempted to finesse her stance on the 2020 election as some other Trump-endorsed candidates have.\n\nIn an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday morning after Major Garrett noted that Masters had said he had not seen evidence of problems that would have changed the 2020 outcome, Lake did not directly answer when asked if Biden is the legitimate president.\n\n“I think we have major problems in our election system. And … it goes back to 2000. We had Democrats saying the 2000 election wasn’t fair,” Lake replied, adding that Democrats had raised questions about several subsequent elections. “Nobody called them election deniers. And now, all of a sudden in 2020, Garrett, we don’t have free speech anymore. We can’t speak out against our own elections. All I’m asking for is the ability to speak out. When our government does something wrong, we should be able to speak out against it.”\n\nFinchem is one of at least 11 Republican nominees running for state elections chief who have questioned, rejected or tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nThe state representative co-sponsored legislation with fellow Republican lawmakers in Arizona that would allow them to reject election results and require election workers to hand count ballots instead of using electronic equipment to tabulate results.\n\nHe has also called for decertifying the 2020 election results in three Arizona counties – even though legal experts say there is no legal mechanism to do so.\n\nThis story has been updated with remarks from Trump’s rally.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2022/10/10/trump-rally-mesa-takeaways/8232033001/', 'Headline': '3 Arizona Trump rally takeaways after a scorching day in Mesa', 'Snippet': 'After a scorching Sunday in Mesa, here are 3 Trump rally takeaways.

Then, she said, things went off the rails.\n\nLake compared her rival, Democrat Katie Hobbs, to Biden for her lack of visibility on the campaign trail, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nWhile Biden spent some of the 2020 campaign working from his basement because of COVID-19 concerns, Hobbs is equally underground, Lake suggested. “I call her ‘Basement Hobbs,’” she said.\n\nThe real attraction was Trump\n\nThe crowd at Bell Bank Park in Mesa had staying power.\n\nAs temperatures climbed to 88 degrees under an intense sun, the crowd showed few signs of thinning as people waited for Trump to arrive on stage. Packed, standing shoulder to shoulder, they waited nearly two hours after Lake had finished her speech. In the meantime, they were entertained by a soundtrack that ranged from ""Phantom of the Opera"" to Elvis to Hot Tramp.\n\nFor many of the thousands who attended Sunday, the draw was Trump more so than the Arizona candidates.\n\nAnn-Marie Villicana drove to the southeast Valley from Pasadena, Calif., with Robin Salzer on Saturday. A founder of LA Trump, a group that supports the former president, Villicana said she wanted to add to the enthusiasm for a strong Republican turnout in the midterms and particularly for Kari Lake.\n\nSalzer said he thinks frustration is bringing people out to events like this.\n\n“People are just fed up, and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” he said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Elgin and four friends flew in from Oregon, sporting their red and white Oregon Women for Trump T-shirts.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” she said.\n\nGet ready for lines at the polls Nov. 8\n\nAn informal survey of attendees as they waited for Trump’s arrival showed elections officials should prepare for lines at the polls.\n\nPerson after person leaning against the metal gates that hemmed in the crowd said they would vote at the polls on Nov. 8 because they don’t trust mail-in voting.\n\n“I like to see it go in,” one man said of watching his ballot get fed into the tabulation machine.\n\nTheir attitudes reflect increased skepticism about the reliability of early voting, or vote by mail, that has grown since the 2020 election.\n\nTrump alluded to that distrust in his talk.\n\n“Sometimes the mail-in ballots are just not as good as being out there on Nov. 8,” he said.\n\n“If you can, vote in person on election day,” Trump said. “Because it’s a lot harder for them to cheat.” He did not clarify who he was referring to.\n\nTrump said those who vote by mail risk getting a “potentially fake ballot.”\n\nThere is no evidence of that ever occurring in Arizona.\n\nIn the August primary, Republican voters showed an uptick in voting at the polls, although voting by mail remained by far the most popular form of voting, used by 85% of voters in Maricopa County.\n\nRepublic reporter Alison Steinbach contributed to this article.'}}",95.41666666666667,1

His defense lawyers also argued that special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into Trump had “significant overlap” with the House select committee’s investigation.\n\nWith the case slated to go to trial in March, Judge Tanya Chutkan is still considering several pretrial motions from Trump’s team, including long-shot motions to dismiss the entire case. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges stemming from efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThompson has defended his panel’s archival process. He said this summer that the committee wasn’t required to keep all of the records it amassed during the monthslong investigation, in response to accusations from Rep. Barry Loudermilk, currently overseeing a House Republican probe into the committee’s work, that certain records were missing.\n\nChutkan, in her ruling Monday, said Trump had not sufficiently justified his subpoena requests and did not establish relevance between the case and certain items he wanted to subpoena, including recorded interviews. The order also says that some of the requested material has already been provided to Trump’s team through discovery.\n\nIn addition, Chutkan noted that Trump’s requested subpoenas lacked specificity about certain information he wanted, comparing the request to a “fishing expedition.”\n\n“The broad scope of the records that Defendant seeks, and his vague description of their potential relevance, resemble less ‘a good faith effort to obtain identified evidence’” than they do a “fishing expedition,” Chutkan wrote.\n\nCNN’s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-supreme-court-january-6-committee-documents/', 'Headline': ""Supreme Court rejects Trump's bid to shield January 6 ... - CBS News"", 'Snippet': ""Supreme Court rejects Trump's bid to shield January 6 records, bringing end to legal battle ... and the select committee received more than 700 pages of records sought by the panel earlier this month."", 'Full_text': 'Washington — The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away former President Donald Trump\'s legal fight with the House select committee investigating the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, bringing an end to the former president\'s quest to stop investigators from accessing reams of documents from his final weeks in the White House.\n\nTrump asked the high court in December to take up his appeal of a decision from the federal appeals court in the District of Columbia, which rejected his efforts to shield the documents from lawmakers and found Trump provided ""no basis"" for it to override President Biden\'s decision not to uphold his predecessor\'s claims of executive privilege over the records.\n\nIn rejecting the former president\'s request, the decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remains in place.\n\nIn addition to asking the Supreme Court to review the lower court\'s decision, the former president requested the justices stop the transfer of records from the National Archives and Records Administration to House investigators. They declined to do so last month, and the select committee received more than 700 pages of records sought by the panel earlier this month.\n\nAt issue in the legal fight between the former president and the House select committee were reams of records related to the events of January 6, including presidential diaries, visitor logs, handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, binders from then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and a draft executive order on election integrity, according to a filing from the National Archives.\n\nTrump asserted executive privilege over more than 750 pages of these documents, which were at the crux of his lawsuit against the National Archives and select committee. But Mr. Biden declined to uphold the former president\'s claims of executive privilege over the documents sought by the panel, and Trump filed suit in October to prevent their disclosure.\n\nSince its formation last year, the committee examining the events surrounding the January 6 attack on the Capitol has interviewed more than 475 witnesses and obtained over 60,000 documents, according to an aide to the panel.\n\nInvestigators have issued dozens of subpoenas as part of their probe, including ones to Trump\'s allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege.

Stephanie Murphy, Democrat of Florida.\n\nThese former lawmakers have lost the platform of their unique congressional panel, but they are ramping up their arguments as Donald Trump appears poised to storm through the 2024 Republican presidential primaries.\n\nThe committee conducted an unparalleled 18-month probe in the U.S. Capitol riot and efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Staging a series of nationally televised, choreographed — and, at times, scripted — public hearings, the panel revealed the breadth of the efforts to overturn the election loss of former President Trump.\n\nThe panel would eventually recommend criminal charges against Trump. It produced a voluminous final report featuring the testimony of longtime Trump insiders and local election officials. The committee also withstood scathing criticism from Republicans, who accused the committee of executing a partisan, politically motivated attempt to take down Trump.\n\nFour of the nine members of the Jan. 6 committee left Congress in early 2023. Two of them, Murphy and Kinzinger, retired from the House. Two others, Luria and former Rep. Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, lost in their reelection campaigns. In separate interviews with CBS News, all of them warn about the risk of an unraveling of American democracy as Trump seeks the Republican nomination and a return to the White House.\n\nCheney and Kinzinger have continued their advocacy against Trump — and in favor of vigilance against threats to democracy — in newly-released books.\n\nCheney\'s book, ""Oath and Honor,"" will be published next month. In recent speeches and forums, she has leaned into warnings about the fragility of democracy. In a speech last month in Minnesota, Cheney said, ""We have a threat domestically. We have a former president trying to unravel democracy."" She also said, ""The problem is not just Donald Trump. The problem is people who deny election outcomes.""\n\nIn his new book ""Renegade: Defending Democracy and Liberty in our Divided Country,"" Kinzinger wrote, ""The militant, intolerant ideologies, the militias, the alienation and the disaffection, the weird fantasies and disinformation, they\'re all still out there ready to go. That\'s the elephant in the room.""\n\nIn an extended interview about the book with CBS News, Kinzinger spoke about the prospects of another Trump victory. He said, ""It\'s really dangerous. January 6th was like a guardrail on an interstate. The car hit the guardrail, and we survived. The guardrails of democracy held up. The problem is the weaknesses are there now, and people know where they are.""\n\nMurphy, who served three terms representing the Orlando area of Florida before retiring in January 2023, spoke by phone with CBS News and shared a warning similar to Kinzinger\'s.\n\n""I used to work at the Department of Defense,"" she said. ""When we looked at our adversaries, we would identify what we call probing strikes. These are strikes that aren\'t intended, necessarily to win the day. I think Jan. 6 was a probing strike. It revealed all of the weaknesses that exist in our system. And what precedes a successful strike is a probing strike. So, I worry deeply about ... a second Trump term because he already has a proving strike under his belt.""\n\nMurphy is a fellow at the University of Chicago and has given public remarks, including for Georgetown University\'s law school, about national security.\n\nSpeaking with CBS News, Murphy said she has ""deep worry"" about the 2024 election. She said, ""There is a chance that (Trump) wins just outright. But there\'s also the possibility that he cheats to win and is more successful this time than he was the previous time.""\n\nLuria lost her reelection bid in 2022 in a closely fought district in the Tidewater area of Virginia. In a series of written exchanges with CBS News, Luria wrote about the stakes of next year\'s presidential election.\n\n""This isn\'t about politics or policy differences,"" she said. ""2024 is a battle for the Constitution and the future of the United States of America.""\n\nShe now sits on the board of directors for BAE Systems, a defense company, and has created a political action committee to help local and state candidates in Virginia.\n\nThe former committee members have also made broader arguments about the future of democracy, beyond Trump and his supporters. Cheney, in public remarks last month, encouraged students to expand their study of history. And she encouraged more women to consider running for public office.\n\nSpeaking with ""Face the Nation"" in October, Cheney expressed alarm about violent political threats, including those experienced by Republican lawmakers during the multi-round House Speaker election last month. Cheney said, ""That is the kind of encouragement and acceptance of violence that is absolutely has no place in this party, should have no place in our country.""\n\nMany congressional Republicans, and Trump himself, have blistered the work and the composition of the House select committee. Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of the Republican appointees to the panel, Rep. Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, and Rep. Jim Banks, Republican of Indiana. House Republicans opted to boycott the panel after Pelosi\'s decision, leaving only two House Republicans on the 9-person panel. Both of those Republicans, Cheney and Kinzinger, were appointed by Pelosi.\n\nAt a September hearing of the Committee on U.S. House Administration, Republicans argued the Jan. 6 select panel failed in its mission to determine and prevent the security failures that occurred during the Capitol siege. Rep. Barry Loudermilk, Republican of Georgia, said, ""Former Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats spent millions of dollars ... yet the committee failed to review with real security failures.""\n\n""Throughout their nearly two years of work, the committee clearly operated on hearsay and cherry-picked so-called evidence,"" Loudermilk said, ""Their multi-million dollar committee effort was a political weapon focused on attacking President Trump and his supporters.""\n\nOther Republicans have labeled the select committee as ""political"" or executors of a ""witch hunt.""\n\nIn his interview with CBS News, Kinzinger pushed back against the criticism about the committee\'s work and the heat he\'s taken from Republicans. He said, ""There\'s so much cowardice in politics today. I think because that is the ultimate fear politicians have of being kicked out of that tribe even more than I think they fear giving their own life.""'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-documents-january-6-panel-1.6320973', 'Headline': 'U.S. Supreme Court allows release of Trump documents to Jan. 6 panel', 'Snippet': 'In a rebuff to former U.S. president Donald Trump, the U.S. Supreme Court is allowing the release of presidential documents sought by the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.', 'Full_text': 'In a rebuff to former U.S. president Donald Trump, the U.S. Supreme Court is allowing the release of presidential documents sought by the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nThe justices on Wednesday rejected a bid by Trump to withhold the documents from the committee until the issue is finally resolved by the courts.

The current administration was concerned that releasing all of the Trump administration documents sought by the committee could compromise national security and executive privilege.\n\nAlone among the justices, Clarence Thomas said he would have granted Trump\'s request to keep the documents on hold.\n\nTrump\'s attorneys had asked the high court to reverse rulings by the federal appeals court in Washington and block the release of the records even after U.S. President Joe Biden waived executive privilege over them.\n\nIn an unsigned opinion, the court acknowledged there are ""serious and substantial concerns"" over whether a former president can win a court order to prevent disclosure of certain records from his time in office in a situation like this one.\n\nBut the court noted that the appeals court determined that Trump\'s assertion of privilege over the documents would fail under any circumstances, ""even if he were the incumbent.""\n\nIt said the issue of a former president\'s ability to claim executive privilege would have to wait for another day.\n\nThe court took issue with the conclusion of the appeals court that downplayed a former president\'s interests, suggesting that the current president could in essence ignore his predecessor\'s claims.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under U.S. president George W.

Former presidents had ""a clear right to protect their confidential records from premature dissemination,"" Trump\'s lawyers said.\n\n""Congress cannot engage in meandering fishing expeditions in the hopes of embarrassing President Trump or exposing the President\'s and his staff\'s sensitive and privileged communications `for the sake of exposure,""\' they added.\n\nBut the House committee responded in its high court brief that although the facts of the case are ""unprecedented,"" the decision was ""not a difficult one.""\n\nThere was no explanation for the timing of the court\'s action. But the National Archives told the appeals court and Trump\'s lawyers that it would turn over some documents it asserted were not part of the court case on Wednesday absent a new court order.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-capitol-jan-6-panel-turns-attention-pence-thursdays-hearing-2022-06-16/', 'Headline': 'Trump pressed, threatened Pence to overturn election, panel hears', 'Snippet': 'Trump and his supporters - including many Republican members of Congress - dismiss the Jan. 6 panel as a political witchhunt.

""I wouldn\'t help (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi and (Jan. 6 Vice Chair) Liz Cheney cross the street — I\'m definitely not going to help them and their partisan Witch Hunt Committee.""\n\nBrooks said he has already given several sworn affidavits and public statements about Jan. 6 and the panel will have to issue a subpoena so close to the election to force him to testify, but that he would fight one.\n\nJackson rejected questions asking if he knew about text messages between members of the far right Oath Keepers group about his security.\n\n""I do not know, nor did I have contact with, those who exchanged text messages about me on January 6. In fact, I was proud to help defend the House Floor from those who posed a threat to my colleagues,"" Jackson said in a statement.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Biggs slammed the two Republicans who sit on the panel, Cheney and outgoing Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger.\n\nThe new requests followed revelations by the members themselves, as in Brooks\' case, and texts uncovered in a criminal probe or texts to Trump\'s Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who turned over thousands of his personal messages to the panel late last year.\n\n""The Select Committee has learned that several of our colleagues have information relevant to our investigation into the facts, circumstances, and causes of January 6th,"" Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Cheney said in a joint statement.\n\nThey called cooperation a ""patriotic duty"" and urged Brooks, Biggs and Jackson to join the long list of witnesses who have testified. So far, the panel has interviewed more than 930 individuals.\n\nBrooks recently drawn interest after Trump withdrew his endorsement in his Republican Senate primary. In March, Brooks issued a statement that Trump pressured him to overturn the presidential election, remove President Biden from office and force a special new election.\n\n""The exchange you have disclosed with the former President is directly relevant to the subject of our inquiry, and it appears to provide additional evidence of President Trump\'s intent to restore himself to power through unlawful means,"" the panel said in the letter to Brooks.\n\nAlong with looking into how Biggs was tied to planning for the Jan. 6 rally and how he worked to overturn the presidential election\'s results, the committee is raising questions about his interest in a presidential pardon related to the siege.\n\n""We would like to understand all the details of a request for a pardon, more specific reasons why a pardon was sought, and the scope of the proposed pardon,"" it said in the letter to Biggs.\n\nFor Jackson, the committee is investigating text messages exchanged among members of the far-right extremist group Oath Keepers and their leader Stewart Rhodes that discussed providing protection during the riot for him and for ""critical data"" he supposedly possessed.\n\n""Why would these individuals have an interest in your specific location? Why would they believe you \'have critical data to protect?\' Why would they direct their members to protect your personal safety?

Scott Perry, and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan — were all declined.\n\nMcCarthy said in January the panel\'s objective was to damage its political opponents.\n\n""And now it wants to interview me about public statements that have been shared with the world, and private conversations not remotely related to the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. I have nothing else to add,"" he said.\n\nBut a spate of those private conversations did indeed become public recently, tied to a book by two New York Times reporters. In three different conversations after the attack, McCarthy was heard saying he wanted to urge Trump to resign, that Trump admitted responsibility for Jan. 6 and that he feared that members of his caucus were fueling dangerous rhetoric.\n\nThose conversations are of interest to the panel. For example, in its Jan. 22 letter, the committee wanted to talk to McCarthy about his remarks on the House floor days after the attack when he said Trump ""bears responsibility.""\n\nAs for Jordan, the panel has said it wants to learn more about his contact with Trump directly and his legal team ahead of the siege.

Two lower courts ruled against him.\n\nHis lawyers urged the Supreme Court to take up his appeal, arguing it raised novel questions about the extent of a former president\'s privilege. Wednesday\'s brief order seemed to agree on that point, calling those questions ""unprecedented"" and saying they ""raise serious and substantial concerns.""\n\nThere is no deadline for the court to decide whether to take up the Trump appeal. But Wednesday\'s order means that even if the former president eventually wins on the legal point about the strength of a former president\'s privilege, any victory would be a hollow one, because the documents will have been turned over in the meantime.\n\nThe House committee asked for a trove of documents related to the events surrounding the riot, including records of communication between the White House and the Justice Department leading up to Jan. 6. Trump objected, asserting executive privilege, but President Joe Biden declined to back up that assertion. Instead, he directed the National Archives to hand over the material.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that although Trump retained some limited authority to claim executive privilege, it wasn\'t strong enough to overcome Biden\'s decision that Congress has a legitimate need for the material. It cited a 1977 Supreme Court decision in a dispute between former President Richard Nixon and the Archives, which said the incumbent president is in the best position to decide whether the privilege should be asserted.\n\nAs long as the Jan. 6 committee cites at least one legislative purpose for the documents, that is enough to justify the request, the appeals court said, even though individual members have suggested they may have partisan political motives in seeking it.\n\nUrging the Supreme Court not to take up the Trump appeal, the committee said it has a proper purpose, because its work will ""lead to specific legislative recommendations designed to prevent any future attacks on the democratic institutions of the Republic.""\n\nIt also discounted Trump\'s claim that forcing the Archives to hand over Oval Office documents could discourage future presidential aides from providing candid advice. That concern is misguided, the committee said, because the conduct under investigation goes far beyond the typical deliberations concerning a president\'s official duties.\n\nLeaving the lower court rulings intact would not encourage future presidents to facilitate congressional attempts to get White House documents involving their predecessors for partisan political reasons, the committee said. ""The fact that every president will someday be a former president provides an incentive to ensure that the privilege is not eroded or abused.""\n\nThe committee urged the Supreme Court to act quickly, saying it needed the documents to help guide its investigation.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/07/22/1112323797/jan-6-hearing-recap-187-minutes', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 panel details what Trump did — and did not do - NPR', 'Snippet': ""Jan. 6 panel sheds light on the 187 minutes Trump went dark during Capitol siege ...

The committee also noted that other Trump calls that day are known, including several to Republican senators to urge them to delay the certification of Biden\'s win.\n\n\'I\'ve seen the impact that his words have on his supporters\'\n\nA major theme from the hearing was how much television the former president consumed as the chaos and violence unfolded.\n\n""President Trump sat in his dining room and watched the attack on television while his senior-most staff closest advisers and family members begged him to do what is expected of any American president,"" Luria said.

He watched as his supporters, donning red caps and chanting his name, overwhelmed and outnumbered police as they flooded the Capitol grounds and attempted to breach the Capitol.\n\nAt 1:49 p.m. ET, just as D.C. police were declaring a riot at the Capitol, Trump tweeted out a video of his speech at the Ellipse earlier that day and did not comment on the violence.\n\nKizinger noted that between 1:49 and 2:24, when Trump posted a subsequent tweet, ""staff repeatedly came into the room to see him and plead that he make a strong public statement condemning the violence and instructing the mob to leave the Capitol.""\n\nThe panel shared video testimony from top advisers and his children imploring Trump to call off the attack.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, a former White House staffer, has previously testified to a conversation between White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\n""I remember [Cipollone] saying something to the effect of, \'Mark we need to do something more.

Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene are suing two Southern California cities and several advocacy groups alleging they conspired to infringe on their free speech rights by pressuring venues to cancel a rally in 2021.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court on Thursday, alleges the venues caved to pressure from the cities of Anaheim and Riverside and canceled contracts for their America First rally because they disagreed with Greene and Gaetz politically. The two lawmakers are known for their strong support of former President Trump.\n\nThe lawsuit contends the 1st Amendment gives the lawmakers the freedom to use the venues “on the same basis as other organizations and political figures without regard to their viewpoint or the viewpoint of speakers at their event.”\n\nA spokesman for the city of Riverside declined to comment on the lawsuit on Friday. Anaheim spokesman Mike Lyster said the city has “not formally received the claim but are aware of it and will be reviewing.”\n\nThe lawsuit also names 10 advocacy or political organizations who allegedly pressured city officials and the venues to not host the rally.\n\nGaetz, Greene and their fundraising committees are seeking a declaration saying each of the defendants violated their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association as part of the lawsuit.\n\nThey are also asking for an injunction prohibiting the cities from denying or “coercing private venues from entering into facilities use contracts with Plaintiffs for future political rallies” and unspecified damages for emotional distress.\n\nAlexander Haberbush, an attorney representing Greene and Gaetz in the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nGreene, a Georgia congresswoman, and Gaetz, who represents much of the Florida Panhandle, tried to host their rally at two locations in Orange County and one in Riverside in July 2021, but the venues kept backing out.\n\nThe first location to fall through was the Pacific Hills Banquet & Event Center in Laguna Hills. The venue’s general manager told the Orange County Register at the time it opted to cancel after learning Gaetz and Greene would be speaking.\n\nThe rally was moved to the Riverside Convention Center, but the city quickly started receiving complaints. Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers “are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.”\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue’s conditional use permit would be “in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.”\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a “peaceful protest against communism” outside Riverside City Hall.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.ocregister.com/2023/07/14/gop-reps-marjorie-taylor-greene-matt-gaetz-are-suing-riverside-anaheim/', 'Headline': 'Anaheim is being sued by GOP Reps.

The taping is about to begin for the 38th episode of Gaetz’s “Firebrand” podcast, and Greene is the high-wattage guest star.\n\nGreene has come straight from Dulles Airport, so Gaetz takes a minute to catch her up on today’s topics before the recording starts. There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her. She knows really well how to wield power.” Why vote against a man you’ve already got wrapped around your little finger?\n\n“The critique of McCarthy is not that he has ignored us, or pretended like we don’t exist,” Gaetz adds with a broad grin. “In fact, he’s highly responsive to us.”\n\nThe MAGA Squad: They’re here. They’re weird. And pretty soon, they may be in control of the GOP Congress—if they aren’t already.\n\nWith reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian""}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/4/4/23669635/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-indictment-protest', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene’s protest for Trump is a zany flop - Vox', 'Snippet': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene’s lonely, kind of zany protest for Trump. Few in the GOP attended a New York rally alongside the pro-Trump lawmaker on Tuesday. by Li Zhou and Jen Kirby. Updated Apr 4 ...', 'Full_text': 'Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day. The rally, which Greene led alongside the New York Young Republicans, drew a crowd of a few dozen Trump supporters, counterprotesters, and curious New Yorkers — all of whom appeared to be outnumbered by media.\n\nThe rally in Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Court House, was less a protest and more like a bizarro carnival. Trump’s Tuesday arraignment took place on an rare New York spring day, which added to the frenetic vibe, as though everyone was unleashed after a long winter.\n\nThe MAGA hats and flags were out, as were a contingent of counterprotesters, imperfectly separated by metal barriers. New Yorkers mingled among them — an artist, a high schooler with a few free periods — who claimed to have wandered down to Lower Manhattan to witness history, or at least the spectacle. And then there were the reporters, swarming everyone in a red hat or with a halfway decent sign.\n\nBut prominent GOP politicians, not so much. The sparse attendance by other elected Republicans highlighted the limitations of what members of the party might be willing to do for Trump, even though they’ve broadly lambasted the charges against him as politically motivated and unfounded.\n\nGreene’s headlining of the event comes after Trump previously called for his supporters to “protest” the charges, a rallying cry that raised concerns of a repeat of the deadly January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when the former president similarly asked supporters to contest the election results. Embattled Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was also spotted by reporters in the crowd of the protest, and was seen headed toward the courthouse where the arraignment was set to take place. Other than that, maybe the highest-profile public figure was the Naked Cowboy.\n\nJanuary 6’s violence — and its legal fallout — have complicated efforts to drum up support for pro-Trump protests. While many lawmakers are eager to show their support for Trump, they’ve largely chosen to do so through fundraising efforts. A previous New York protest on March 20 was also poorly attended, and protests in South Carolina and California drew small crowds this past week as well. Most GOP lawmakers appear unwilling to put themselves in a position where they could be linked to Trump-related violence, and in the face of ongoing trials for insurrectionists, grassroots supporters appear hesitant to do so as well.\n\nThe New York Young Republicans pointedly described the Tuesday rally as a “peaceful protest” that called out the political persecution of Trump’s indictment, with Greene warning participants against violence. The crowd greeted Marjorie Taylor Green’s arrival to the rally with cheers and jeers, but throughout the morning until Trump’s arrival in Lower Manhattan, the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nRepublicans in general have harshly criticized the indictment and framed it as a way for Democrats to attack Trump yet again. Leaders like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), however, have previously urged “calmness” and pushed back on Trump’s calls for protest. They have assisted with the former president’s efforts to use the indictment to raise money, though. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) solicited donations on Fox News, for example, and the Trump campaign claims it’s brought in over $7 million in the past few days.\n\nThe lukewarm Republican response to Trump’s calls for protests, however, indicate that many in the GOP are only willing to go so far, particularly as the specter of the January 6 insurrection continues to loom over the party.\n\n“I think they calculate that they can take a goldilocks strategy — stay in the good graces of their base by not attacking him, but maintain plausible deniability in the future by not attending a protest,” says American University government professor David Barker.\n\nTrump is back, and no one seems to know quite what to make of it\n\nTuesday in Collect Pond Park, Trump supporters were angry about Trump’s indictment, but there was also a sense of anticipation: The thing Trump always said would happen — that he’d be targeted by an establishment that was out to get him — did. They were here to defend Trump, to support him, pray for him, and commiserate together.\n\nMelinda, 61, who drove up to New York from outside Fall’s Church, Virginia, sat on a bench in the park, hours before Trump’s arraignment. “I’m here to pray for the safety of the city and the people and President Trump,” she said.\n\nShe added that she loved her president, pointing to a pin of the presidential seal on the collar of the jacket. For her, the charges felt larger than just Trump. “What’s happening is they’re about to open a Pandora’s box. Because now, nobody’s safe,” Melinda said. “Any president, VP, Supreme Court justice, can now be publicly arrested, so I think it will boomerang.”\n\nThe crowd got bigger as the morning wore on and Trump’s arraignment loomed. There were red hats, of course, but maybe not as many as you might think. The rest fell into two camps: folks in sunglasses and T-shirts, as if they were NYC tourists; and the over-the-top. That included a guy in a banana suit — “Banana Republic” costume, as he explained — with a copy of the US Constitution in his hand.\n\nThe closer to Trump’s arraignment it got, the weirder it got, too: a woman, her body painted white, in a diaper. An Abe Lincoln. A guy in an orange jumpsuit, wearing a Trump mask. As inmate Trump worked the crowd, one woman pointed directly at him. “It’s Hillary Clinton,” she said, ignoring his face. “Hey, Hillary, you finally got locked up.”\n\nAnti-Trump protesters also filtered through. Jojo Keys, 39, from Manhattan, said he was an independent who had come to witness history. When Taylor Green entered the park, he jumped up and down, shouting “Liar, liar!”\n\nThere were also “Fuck Joe Biden” cheers and “USA” chants, and there was a cowbell, somewhere, of course. But mostly, the currency was signs. The ones you know: Make America Great, Trump 2024, Stop the Steal, Q. And then some new ones on the scene, some better than others: “Salem 1692 / Bragg 2023.” “From Build Back Better to Biden, Bragg, Banana Republic in 2 Years.”\n\nMichael Austin, a 59-year-old Manhattanite, had the Build Back Better to Banana Republic sign, which he rested at his feet. In his hands, he held a “Fags for Trump” sign. “It is a seven-year-long, slow-rolling constant coup d’etat,” Austin said. “They have used the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the DHS, and foreign spy agencies to persecute a reformer, who came to reform the corrupt system, and they don’t like it.”\n\nPretty much everyone had cameras out, filming or photographing the scene for their own memories, and maybe to make sure that they had evidence in case anything happened.\n\nThough nothing really did. People cheered, they chatted, they waited. Trump arrived at the courthouse in the afternoon, the crowd noting his arrival with helicopters overhead. “Trump is in the house,” one woman called out. But otherwise, the crowd stood, behind a fence and behind rows of television cameras, facing the court house, knowing, at least, that the former president was inside.\n\nThe lingering impact of January 6\n\nTrump’s calls for protests, which the former president posted in March as he anticipated the indictment, follow significant fallout from the January 6 insurrection. The storming of the Capitol ultimately led to five deaths, 140 injured police officers, and hundreds of arrests. It’s also proven to be politically damaging for Republicans following an intensive investigation by Congress’s January 6 committee, with polling showing that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the attack.\n\nConcerns about the violence that occurred on January 6 have hung over these potential rallies as well, with New York Mayor Eric Adams calling on Taylor Greene and other protesters to be on their “best behavior.” Multiple Republican lawmakers have made similar requests of Trump supporters, like McCarthy, who said in mid-March that “there should not be any violence.”\n\nRelatedly, pro-Trump backers have signaled reluctance about these protests amid concerns they could be a trap laid by federal agents, after more than a thousand people have been charged following the insurrection. As CNN’s Sean Lyngaas, Zachary Cohen, and Donie O’Sullivan reported, pro-Trump forums have included speculation that these demonstrations were a “set up” intended to pin blame on them for violence caused by other groups, like the antifa or antifascist movement. (On January 6, this incorrect theory was used by some Republicans to obscure the role of Trump supporters in the violence and damage that was caused.) An expert also told CNN that Trump backers may be seeking alternate routes to oppose the indictment including specific targeting of officials like District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe combination of lawmakers’ own apparent political concerns, and Trump supporters’ practical worries about a law enforcement “set up,” seem to have dampened the involvement in protests this week.\n\nFor Republican lawmakers, there’s been an ongoing balancing act regarding their backing for Trump. If they were to actively criticize and condemn him, they risk serious electoral blowback much like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who lost her Republican House primary. Tying themselves too closely to Trump, however, also comes with its own risks, particularly for lawmakers in more moderate states and districts. In the 2022 midterms, election-denier candidates in battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan broadly lost. And there are still a lot of unknowns about Trump’s legal woes, as he faces other potential charges in cases involving overturning the election results and his role in January 6.\n\n“Now they must calculate not just the current rank-and-file GOP rallying around Trump, but also what happens if more indictments tumble down in the coming months,” says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\n\nThese collective factors, it seems, have curbed the interest in these protests for now.\n\nUpdate, 5 pm ET: This story has been updated with crowd reactions throughout the arraignment day.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jan6-committee-hearing-maga-capitol-attack-1386078/', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Committee Hearing to Showcase Pro-Trump Lawmakers Fleeing Mob', 'Snippet': 'Republicans like Reps.

Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) claimed the insurrection “a normal tourist visit,” social media users quickly located photos of the Georgia Republican gasping in terror and hiding behind an armed Capitol police officer pointing a handgun at a barricaded entrance to the Senate floor.\n\nIn the 18 months since the insurrection, Republican lawmakers have tried to whitewash it through a series of contradictory talking points. Republicans have alternately downplayed the attack by calling it “a peaceful protest,” claimed it was violent but that the violence was carried out solely by nonexistent “antifa” or federal informants at the Capitol, or that Democrats were to blame for failing to adequately defend the Capitol against the protesters they variously claim weren’t violent or a threat.\n\nRepublicans like Reps. Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Paul Gosar have gone so far as to cast alleged rioters held in pretrial detention as unjustly accused political prisoners.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nThe bulk of the Thursday-night hearing is expected to focus on Trump’s actions during the insurrection, including whether he took any action to defuse the riot at a time when lawmakers were under attack. But using photos and footage to slap down MAGA lawmakers’ claims of a “tourist visit” from “peaceful patriots” is part of a broader effort to bring reality to bear on a fictitious, pro-Trump reimagining of Jan. 6.\n\nThat mythology, peddled widely in conservative media, claims Trump and his allies planned a peaceful rally to highlight credible reports of systemic election fraud, exercising their First Amendment rights in an effort to protect democracy. In that warped telling, the peaceful demonstrations were hijacked by a small number of violent extremists with no connection to Trump or his team. And, as the lie goes, Democrats have since wildly overstated the violence as a political ploy.\n\nThrough interviews with more than 1,000 individuals and reviews of more than 125,000 records, the Jan. 6 committee has debunked every part of that narrative. Instead, the committee has demonstrated that Trump attempted to steal an election he was repeatedly told he’d lost. And that his efforts to steal it included directing a wildly unconstitutional phony-electors scheme — and priming his supporters for a Capitol attack.\n\nAs Trump spoke at his preplanned rally near the White House, he called for a march on the U.S. Capitol, bolstering a crowd of people who violently clashed with law enforcement. Testimony given to the committee indicated that Trump and members of the administration were aware of the potential for violence, and witnesses have alleged that Trump went so far as to ask for security at his Ellipse rally to be loosened so armed individuals could enter the crowd. Trump’s team has attempted to distance itself from any of the Capitol events, but the committee has revealed that the former president’s call for his supporters’ march was premeditated.\n\nThe committee obtained a draft of an unsent tweet in which Trump teased a march to the Capitol following his speech at the Ellipse. “I will be making a Big Speech at 10 a.m. on January 6th at the Ellipse (South of the White House),” read the draft tweet, preserved by the National Archives. “Please arrive early, massive crowds expected. March to the Capitol after. Stop the steal!”\n\nRelated Content\n\nThe committee also displayed a text exchange on Jan. 4 between White House Ellipse rally organizer Kylie Kremer and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, in which the pair discussed a secret plan to have Trump call for protesters to march to a second location, either the Supreme Court or Capitol, on Jan. 6. In the exchange Kremer urged Lindell to keep the plans secret, since they did not have permits for the march.\n\nA second text message, from Ali Alexander, written on Jan. 5 outlined that plan for the next day. “Tomorrow: Ellipse then US Capitol. Trump is supposed to order us to capitol at the end of his speech but we will see.”\n\nRolling Stone this spring reported that top Trump officials held a phone call with Kremer during which they actively planned for the march.\n\nTrump’s team has also sought to portray Trump as opposed to the Capitol violence, but the committee revealed he actively resisted efforts to quell the violence — including by refusing to call the actions “illegal” when prompted to do so.\n\nIn her bombshell testimony before the committee, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson revealed that she had drafted a statement for President Trump asking protesters who had entered the Capitol “illegally” to leave. According to Hutchinson, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows took the draft statement to Trump, who scratched out the word “illegally” and refused to issue it. Hutchinson was told there would be no “further action on that statement.”\n\nStephanie Grisham, former chief of staff and press secretary to First Lady Melania Trump, later tweeted out a screenshot of a text exchange between her and the first lady on Jan. 6, in which Melania refused to issue a statement condemning “lawlessness and violence” by protesters. Grisham resigned from her position later that day.\n\nIndeed, Trump has since continually considered ways to lessen the legal consequences for the Capitol rioters. Hutchinson also revealed that Trump wanted to include language in his Jan. 7 speech about pardoning his supporters who stormed the Capitol, and that Meadows agreed with the inclusion of such language. According to previous testimony given by Hutchinson, the pardon offer was ultimately removed from the speech on the advice of the White House counsel’s office.\n\nThe possibility of pardons has remained in the president’s mind since he left office. At a January rally in Houston, he told supporters, “If I run, and if I win, we will treat those people from Jan. 6 fairly. And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons, because they are being treated so unfairly.”\n\nThe Jan. 6 insurrection was the highest-profile part of a broader effort to steal the 2020 election, but it was far from the only way Trump and his team tried to overturn the results. The committee has revealed that Trump took a “direct and personal role” in efforts to pressure states to change their results or appoint phony electors who’d contravene voters by throwing their support to Trump.\n\nIn the committee’s fourth hearing, lawmakers described Trump pressuring individual state legislators to go back into session and declare him the true winner of the 2020 election. Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, was told by the former president to “find” the votes necessary to give him the state.\n\nA separate scheme was concocted by Trump lawyer John Eastman to send two slates of alternate electors, declaring Trump the winner, to the congressional certification of the Electoral College vote and having Vice President Pence use the false electors in the vote. Eastman knew the scheme was illegal, and admitted so in front of Trump days before the Electoral College certification. The committee revealed on June 21 that this scheme culminated in an attempt by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) to deliver the fake electors to Pence on Jan. 6.\n\nNone of this was in response to credible information about systemic election fraud, and Trump knew that — or at least he would have, had he listened to multiple high-level members of his administration.\n\nDuring its first hearing, the committee played recorded testimony from Trump’s former attorney general, Bill Barr. In his testimony, Barr told the committee that he had been clear with the former president that his claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him were “bullshit.” Barr would go on to testify that attempts by him and other advisers to convince Trump that the 2020 election was legitimate were futile, and described Trump as being “detached from reality.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.vice.com/en/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-tweets-testimony/', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene to Jan. 6: I Don’t Know Her - VICE', 'Snippet': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene has an absolutely terrible memory, and very little control over her social media accounts. ...

That’s her story, anyway.\n\nIn a mint-green dress with a gold cross displayed prominently, the Georgia congresswoman appeared in an Atlanta courtroom Friday to testify under oath about whether she participated in an insurrection. “I don’t remember,” and “I don’t recall,” Greene testified repeatedly to straightforward questions on whether she’d talked about the Jan. 6 protest with other members of Congress, or any “Stop the Steal” organizers before the Capitol riot.\n\nGreene is facing a challenge from a group of constituents in her northwest Georgia district who say her alleged role in the violent Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol should disqualify her from running for re-election. The challenge was brought under a Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment that says officials who engage in “insurrection or rebellion” or have “given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof” should be barred from holding political office.\n\nThe question at the heart of the case is what an insurrection looks like in the year 2021—whether the Capitol riot fits that definition, and whether Greene’s words and conduct before, during, and after the attack make her culpable.\n\nFriday’s proceedings marked the first time a member of Congress has testified publicly, under oath, about their involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nAdministrative law judge Charles Beaudrot agreed to recognize the congresswoman as a “hostile witness,” after she repeatedly refused to answer or evaded questions about her social media posts and belief in the conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was “stolen” from former president Donald Trump.\n\nGreene even dodged questions about how she uses Twitter and Facebook and said she couldn’t recall specific incendiary messages she shared from her social media accounts prior to Jan. 6.\n\nShe also repeated false claims about a “tremendous amount of voter fraud” in the 2020 election, but asserted that it was “not accurate” that she hoped Congress would not certify Joe Biden as the election’s winner.\n\nGreene’s supporters packed the courtroom and cheered when she entered. They also clapped when Beaudrot dismissed the court for a break later in the morning. “This is not a show,” Beaudrot scolded them. “Do not do that.” Notable among Greene’s supporters present was Rep. Matt Gaetz, a right-wing congressman from Florida.\n\n“This was not a case where leaders were on horseback leading the charge,” said Ron Fein, legal director for Free Speech for People, a left-leaning civil liberties group, who cross-examined Greene. “The leaders were not standing in Richmond, Virginia, giving long-winded speeches to justify the mayhem. The leaders of this insurrection were among us, on Twitter, on Facebook. The evidence will show that Marjorie Taylor Greene was one of them.”\n\nGreene’s attorney, James Bopp Jr., called the legal challenge a “political smear” campaign against the controversial congresswoman, and asserted that Fein was glossing over key legal definitions of “insurrection” or “engaged.”\n\nFein asked Greene whether she thought if someone “broke the law in a way designed to interfere with the process of counting Electoral College votes,” would they be “an enemy of the constitution.”\n\n“You mean interrupting Congress?” replied Greene. “Interrupting Congress, like when the Democrats interrupted Congress and staged a sit-in?”\n\nShe also testified that she had no expectation of violence on Jan. 6. “I have never once seen violence from Trump people,” she claimed. “The only violence I had seen from antifa and BLM rallies.”\n\nFein, amid numerous objections from Bopp, grilled Greene about specific social media posts and past remarks—and likes of posts.\n\n“You’ve had your disagreements with [Nancy] Pelosi, right?” asked Fein.\n\n“Politically speaking, that would be correct,” Greene replied.\n\n“You don’t agree on a lot of things?” asked Fein. “Politically speaking, that would be correct,” she repeated.\n\n“You think Pelosi is a traitor to the country,” he said. “I’m not answering that question; it’s speculation,” she said.\n\nFein then pulled up an exhibit that showed Greene saying Pelosi was “a traitor to our country, guilty of treason.” He also asked her about a Facebook comment she appeared to “like” that said a “bullet to the head” would be a quicker way to remove Pelosi from office. “I have had many people manage my social media account,” said Greene, adding that she didn’t know who liked that one.\n\n“Are you testifying under oath that wasn’t you?” asked Fein.\n\n“I am testifying I had no idea who liked that comment,” Greene replied.\n\nFein also pointed to a CNN article (prompting snickers from the courtroom), quoting 2019 remarks by Greene (in the context of a protest to fund the Southern border wall), in which she said a good way for people to express their displeasure with the government is to “flood the Capitol.”\n\n“The Capitol belongs to the people,” she replied. When Fein read out additional comments from 2019 where Greene talked about the need to “rise up” and hoping “the American people” wouldn’t be forced to use non-peaceful means, she denied making them.\n\nGreene called Fein a “conspiracy theorist” by reading statements that were quoted in CNN, and said that the news outlet regularly prints lies about her. Fein then played a video that showed her making those same remarks, verbatim.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-marjorie-taylor-greene-protests-new-york-city-arraignment-president-indictment/', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene joins protests in New York City, chants with ...', 'Snippet': 'GOP Reps.

She spoke briefly, calling Trump the ""top Republican candidate for president for 2024,"" and saying, ""We cannot tolerate this injustice in the United States of America.

Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol.

Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L.

""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6.

Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/factchecking-claims-about-the-jan-6-capitol-riot/', 'Headline': 'FactChecking Claims About the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot', 'Snippet': 'Trump supporters clash with police and security forces at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. ... for the breakdown of security.” ... of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check/jan-6-capitol-pelosi', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist', 'Snippet': 'Efforts to blame Speaker Nancy Pelosi for security failures are baseless. ...

Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/nancy-pelosi-january-6th-camera-crew-action/', 'Headline': 'Documentary footage of Pelosi on Jan. 6, 2021, doesn’t ... - Poynter', 'Snippet': 'Newly released Jan. 6, 2021, footage shows the then-House speaker, her staff and security detail walking through the corridors of the Capitol.

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for her role on Jan. 6, 2021 — the day a crowd of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nNewly released Jan. 6, 2021, footage shows the then-House speaker, her staff and security detail walking through the corridors of the Capitol. Johnson claimed that footage proved Pelosi had a nefarious role in the incident.\n\n“She had a camera crew follow her around on January 6th,” he wrote. “New tapes show her waiting to stage her escape until the camera man (her daughter) said, ‘Action!’ It was all a movie. It was a script. It was all planned.”\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\nJohnson did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but the new footage he appears to have referred to was posted on Just The News, a conservative website founded by John Solomon, a journalist and opinion writer whose past work has furthered unproven narratives.\n\nThe video, which Solomon described as Capitol Police security footage that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy “made available” to Just The News, has no sound. It shows Pelosi walking through the corridors alongside members of her staff and security personnel. In the video, a woman who remains just steps away from Pelosi appears to be recording with a hand-held camera. Just The News identified that woman as Pelosi’s daughter Alexandra Pelosi.\n\nIt has been publicly reported by multiple news organizations that Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker, filmed her mother during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. This isn’t unusual. Fox News reported that she has filmed her mother at the Capitol for decades.\n\nIn October 2022, Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact there wasn’t a camera crew that day — just Alexandra Pelosi with a small, hand-held camera that she always carries.\n\nThe security camera footage posted by Just The News supports Hammill’s assertion.\n\nThe clips do not prove that the events on Jan. 6, 2021, were part of a scripted plan. During years of reporting on the attack, PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that the attack was contrived.\n\nFueled partly by the false belief that the presidential election had been stolen, hundreds of people — many clad in Trump-branded apparel, others in helmets and combat gear, some armed with weapons — stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, aiming to stop the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nRioters scaled walls, broke windows, forced their way into the building and repeatedly clashed with police. One woman was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer during the attack. The siege forced lawmakers to evacuate and temporarily delayed the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nSince the attack, more than 1,000 people have faced federal charges for crimes ranging from obstruction of Congress to using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Of those, more than 580 people have pleaded guilty and 514 have been sentenced, according to an NPR analysis.\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. Capitol’s top operations and maintenance official told lawmakers that the costs of the riot — including repairs, increased security and the provision of mental health services — would exceed $30 million.\n\nFalsehoods about the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including claims that it was a false flag, were named PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year.

The information ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Transcripts of interviews with law enforcement officials released this week by the Jan. 6 committee reveal the panel learned that numerous security concerns had been raised in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMany of the revelations came in interviews with high-ranking individuals such as former Secret Service and White House official Anthony Ornato; former executive director of the National Capitol Threat Intelligence Center Donell Harvin; former Deputy FBI Director David Bowdich; Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee; former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund; and House Staff Director Jamie Fleet.\n\nBut some of the new information came from questions posed to those officials by Jan. 6 committee staffers based on details they had gathered in the course of the 18-month investigation.\n\nMuch of that information, mentioned by investigators during the interviews, was not included in the appendix of the committee\'s final report that addressed law enforcement and intelligence failures. For the most part, Jan. 6 committee leaders decided against focusing the final report on how law enforcement came to be so underprepared for the attack.\n\nThe new revelations add to a growing body of evidence from news reports and court proceedings that illustrate how federal law enforcement officials were in possession of ample information that indicated Jan. 6 was going to be violent. As NBC News first reported last month, staffers were informed that chapters prepared by committee staff — including material focused on law enforcement and intelligence failures — would be cut from the final version.\n\nAmong the revelations from the transcripts: One FBI employee wrote in a Dec. 26, 2020, memo about planning for Jan. 6 that was unfolding on a pro-Trump forum called TheDonald.\n\n“They think they will have a large enough group to march into DC armed, and it will outnumber the police so they can’t be stopped,"" read the notification in the eGuardian system, which is meant to help federal, state and local law enforcement officials coordinate. ""They believe that since the election was stolen, that it’s their constitutional right to over take the government and during this coup no U.S. laws apply. Another group of Proud Boys will be in DC already and are planning on blocking the roads with their cars in order to stop traffic.""\n\nNBC News previously reported that one of the FBI’s own confidential sources informed the bureau on the day that Trump sent his Dec. 19, 2020, “will be wild” tweet about Jan. 6 that far-right groups saw it as a “call to arms.” The FBI received numerous tips about the potential for violence on Jan. 6, including from the son of a Texas man who ultimately came to the Capitol with a gun, and the bureau briefed other law enforcement entities about threats, including intelligence that suggested the Oath Keepers had set up armed ""quick reaction forces"" in Virginia that were set to come into D.C. at Trump\'s command. Two members of the Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy at a trial that ended last month, and three others pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee transcripts detailed the challenges facing the FBI in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Days before the attack, the FBI lost use of the program it had been using to track threats on social media, as the bureau transitioned to a new product to gather open source information. An FBI intelligence analyst raised concerns about that on New Year\'s Eve, as threats about Jan. 6 continued to increase.\n\n“We have an urgent need for the DataMinr replacement to be on and active starting on January 4th in support of some potential issues in the D.C. area,” the analyst wrote in a Dec. 31, 2020, email. “The sudden discontinuation is most untimely as much of our crisis response funnels through DataMinr.”\n\nBowdich, in his interview with Jan. 6 investigators, said there was a lot happening at the bureau in the days before the attack: There had been a major cyber intrusion; a bomb had gone off in downtown Nashville, Tenn.; the first anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani was approaching; and the bureau was receiving a lot of intelligence about the potential for violence, much of which was publicly available on social media.\n\n“I wish you could see the volume,” Bowdich told the committee, referring to the number of threats the FBI reviews. “It is off the charts. ... One of our greatest challenges is social media today.”\n\nThe bureau did make efforts to try to disrupt extremists\' travel to D.C.; the FBI\'s Domestic Terrorism Operations Section messaged all domestic terrorism assistant special agents in charge across the country to determine whether any of the extremists they were watching were planning to go to D.C. on Jan. 6.\n\nUltimately, the FBI set up a national command post for the event inside the Strategic Information Operations Center at FBI headquarters in Washington.\n\n“The noise seemed to be growing as we got closer to the event, and it reached a point of we just didn’t know what was going to happen,"" Bowdich said. ""Sometimes you just get a sense for it when you’ve been doing it.”\n\nSome of those officials interviewed by the committee about the intelligence failures made clear they thought there were problems that needed to be fixed, both before Jan. 6 and going forward.\n\n“[Y]ou don’t need intelligence. I mean, everybody knew that people were directed to come there by the President. November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, who was head of the D.C. National Guard on Jan. 6. The information publicly available made clear that Jan. 6 “was going to be a big deal,” he said.\n\nSund, the former Capitol Police chief who resigned the day after the attack, said that intelligence he received didn\'t ""send up a bunch of red flags for me"" because most protests target Congress. Harvin, the former chief of homeland security and intelligence for D.C., told the committee that Sund shouldn\'t characterize what happened as an intelligence failure, but as a failure to act on intelligence.\n\n“He said it was intelligence failure,"" Harvin said. ""It may have been an intelligence failure on his agency’s part and a failure to properly contextualize and pervade the threat environment, but it wasn’t an intelligence failure at large.”\n\nContee, the D.C. police chief, said there needed to be better sharing of intelligence, and that he would have liked to have known about a Capitol Police report about some of the threats related to Jan. 6.\n\n“I don’t think I want to get notified about Armageddon through an email,"" Contee said. ""That would not be my preferred notification, right?”\n\nWhen asked about what she thought the intelligence failures were, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was blunt.\n\n""People didn\'t think that these white nationalists would overthrow the Capitol building,"" the Democratic mayor said.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/01/05/1069977469/a-timeline-of-how-the-jan-6-attack-unfolded-including-who-said-what-and-when', 'Headline': 'A timeline of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack - NPR', 'Snippet': ""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., bangs the speaker's gavel during a joint session of Congress to count the Electoral College votes of the 2020 presidential election on Jan. 6, 2021."", 'Full_text': 'January 6, 2021, was a Wednesday.

""And if you\'re not, I\'m going to be very disappointed in you.""\n\nMeanwhile, Trump supporters head to both the Arkansas and Idaho state capitol buildings.\n\nAnd even before Trump ends his speech, crowds from his rally start to gather outside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAt about the same time, Pence releases a letter, calling his role in the certification of the electoral votes ""largely ceremonial,"" essentially saying he will not act as Trump has asked.\n\n""My oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,"" Pence writes.\n\n1 p.m.\n\nAn initial wave of protesters storms the outer police barrier around the Capitol.\n\n1:05 p.m.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi bangs the gavel to call the joint session of Congress to order.\n\nShortly after that, Trump ends his speech.\n\n""We\'re going to the Capitol,"" he says. ""We\'re going to try and give them [Republicans] the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.""\n\nTrump returns to the White House. He does not go to the Capitol.\n\nAbout two minutes later, in the House chambers, Rep.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, joins in Gosar\'s objection.\n\nThe House and Senate split to deliberate the objection in separate parts of the Capitol building.\n\nAt the same time, in Michigan, hundreds rally in front of the state capitol, which protesters stormed less than a year earlier to decry pandemic restrictions.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., a large portion of the crowd at Trump\'s speech marches toward the Capitol, shouting, ""USA, USA, USA!""\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nOn the steps on the backside of the Capitol, protesters overcome the police, who run back into the building. Protesters watching from the sidelines cheer as a mob breaks through the final police barricades.\n\nInside the building, both the House and Senate proceed, with lawmakers seemingly unaware of the mayhem outside.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell takes the Senate floor.\n\n""Voters, the courts and the states have all spoken — they\'ve all spoken,"" he says. ""If we overrule them, it would damage our republic forever.""\n\nAround this same time, suspicious packages are found at the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., and nearby buildings are evacuated. The packages are later confirmed to be pipe bombs.\n\nShortly after 2 p.m.\n\nProtesters break windows and climb into the Capitol. They open doors for others to follow.\n\nSecret Service agents whisk Pence off the Senate floor.\n\nA few minutes later, Pelosi is ushered off the House floor.\n\n2:20 p.m.\n\nThe Senate is called to recess, and the House is called to recess shortly after.\n\nThe building goes into lockdown.\n\nAround this same time, Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman saves the Senate from a very close call, waving Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, to safety and then diverting protesters who were steps from the Senate chamber.\n\n2:24 p.m.\n\nTrump tweets: ""Mike Pence didn\'t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.""\n\nHe continues with more baseless claims about a fraudulent election.\n\n2:38 p.m.\n\nTrump tweets again, calling for support of the Capitol Police and law enforcement. He urges people to ""stay peaceful.""\n\nBut at that moment, inside the Capitol, the riot continues to unfold.\n\nRep.

""We were just told that there has been tear gas in the rotunda, and we\'re being instructed to each of us get gas masks that are under our seats,"" he says.\n\nElsewhere in the country, protesters gather — at the Louisiana and Florida state capitols and the Ohio Statehouse. Several other state capitols are evacuated as a precaution.\n\nShortly before 3 p.m.\n\nRioters break into the Senate chamber. Many jump from the balcony to the floor below. They climb onto the podium and take photos and selfies, and they rifle through papers lawmakers left behind.\n\nMany also march through the halls of the Capitol. They bang on doors, destroy property and eventually break into lawmakers\' offices — most notably, that of Pelosi.\n\n3:11 p.m.\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., tweets a video while sheltering in his office, saying that this was the cost of telling people they could overturn the election.\n\n""Mr. President, you have got to stop this. You are the only person who can call this off. Call it off,"" Gallagher implores. ""The election is over. Call it off.""\n\nAround the same time, a swarm of rioters chanting, ""Break it down! Break it down!"" overwhelms Capitol Police officers guarding the Speaker\'s Lobby, where lawmakers are sheltered.\n\nThey break windows and try to force their way in.\n\nA Capitol Police officer shoots Ashli Babbitt as she tries to climb through the doors. She later dies of her injuries.\n\nSimultaneously, Trump tweets again, asking everyone to remain peaceful. Notably, he does not recant any of his claims about election fraud.\n\n3:36 p.m.\n\nMore than two hours after protesters first breached the Capitol grounds, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweets that Trump has ordered the National Guard to the Capitol.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump supporters begin to gather in Sacramento, Calif.; Austin, Texas; Denver and Minneapolis. Denver closes its city offices early, as does the Texas Capitol.\n\nShortly after 4 p.m.\n\nBiden addresses the nation.\n\n""I call on President Trump to go on national television now, to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege. This is not a protest — it is an insurrection,"" Biden says.\n\n4:17 p.m.\n\nTrump does not go on TV. Instead, he tweets a video talking to his supporters inside the Capitol.\n\n""I know your pain. I know your hurt,"" he begins. ""We love you. You\'re very special. You\'ve seen what happens. You\'ve seen the way others are treated. ... I know how you feel, but go home, and go home in peace.""\n\nAround the same time, Maryland and Virginia send National Guard and state troopers to the District of Columbia.\n\nIn the next hour, protesters in Arizona pound on the state capitol doors and break a window. A demonstration in Salem, Ore., turns violent.\n\nShortly before 6 p.m.\n\nAlmost five hours after the rioting began, police start to clear the Capitol and eventually secure the interior.\n\n6 p.m.\n\nMuriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, D.C., places the city under a 12-hour curfew.\n\n6:01 p.m.\n\nTrump tweets again.\n\n""These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!""\n\n7 p.m.\n\nFacebook removes Trump\'s video and one other post from the day. In a statement, the company says, ""We removed from Facebook and Instagram the recent video of President Trump speaking about the protests and his subsequent post about the election results. We made the decision that on balance these posts contribute to, rather than diminish, the risk of ongoing violence.""\n\nFacebook then bans Trump for 24 hours. He is currently under a two-year ban.\n\n7:02 p.m.\n\nTwitter removes Trump\'s tweets from the day and shuts down his account for 12 hours. His account is later suspended permanently.\n\n7:54 p.m.\n\nThe Republican National Committee condemns the day\'s violence.\n\nJust after 8 p.m.\n\nPence reopens the Senate.\n\n""Today was a dark day in the history of the United States Capitol. ... Let\'s get back to work,"" he says to applause.\n\nAnd McConnell makes a statement.\n\n""The United States Senate will not be intimidated,"" he says. ""We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.""\n\nThe debate over Arizona\'s ballots continues, more than six hours after it began.\n\nAround 9 p.m.\n\nPelosi brings the House back into session.\n\n""We always knew this would take well into the night, and we will stay as long as it takes. Our purpose will be accomplished,"" she says.\n\n9:53 p.m.\n\nIn a blazing speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says, ""Count me out. Enough is enough."" Graham says he hates to see his journey with Trump end this way.\n\n11:32 p.m.\n\nThe House and Senate come back together to resume the joint session, and the vote that began some 10 hours earlier continues.\n\n3:42 a.m., Jan. 7\n\nPence calls a majority of the Electoral College votes for Biden.\n\n""The announcement of the state of the vote by the president of the Senate shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice president of the United States,"" Pence says, and officially affirms the election results certifying Biden as the 46th president.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/us/politics/jan-6-video-pelosi-schumer-capitol.html', 'Headline': 'New Jan. 6 Video Shows Pelosi and Schumer Scrambling to Secure the ...', 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — Huddling with congressional leaders in a secure location as the Capitol was under siege on Jan. 6, 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was emphatic: There had to be a way to show the public ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Huddling with congressional leaders in a secure location as the Capitol was under siege on Jan. 6, 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was emphatic: There had to be a way to show the public that the government could function and the transfer of power could continue.\n\nShe asked: Was there a way to return to the Capitol and continue the ceremonial counting of electoral votes to certify the election that had been disrupted as a mob of President Donald J.

The document, which is more ...', 'Full_text': 'After roughly 18 months of investigations, the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has released their full report.\n\nThe document, which is more than 800 pages long, recommends the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in the attack. And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}}",97.91666666666667,1

A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/61075086', 'Headline': ""Biden sets rule banning sale of untraceable DIY 'ghost gun' kits - BBC"", 'Snippet': 'US President Joe Biden\'s administration has finalised a set of new regulations targeting untraceable ""ghost guns"".

Background checks have not previously been required to purchase the assembly kits.\n\nThe new rules require self-assembled ""buy build shoot"" kits to have serial numbers - legally making them a firearm.\n\n""You buy a couch [that] you have to assemble, it\'s still a couch,"" said Mr Biden said in his news conference.\n\n""You buy the parts you need to build a functioning firearm, it\'s still a gun.""\n\nIt also forces federally licensed firearm dealers to add serial numbers to any untraceable guns purchased through them.\n\nExperts say that a fraction of violent crimes are being committed with ghost guns, but law enforcement authorities say they are being recovered more frequently at crime scenes.\n\nIn 2021, there were about 20,000 suspected ghost guns recovered by police and reported to the ATF - a tenfold increase from 2016, according to the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, the firearms business has seen record sales since the early days of the pandemic two years ago. In 2020, a record of about 22m guns were legally sold. Almost 19m guns were bought in 2021.\n\nAlso on Monday, Mr Biden announced a new nominee for the ATF after his first choice failed to advance through the Senate confirmation process because of Republican opposition.\n\nIf confirmed, former US attorney for Ohio Steve Dettlebach will be the first to hold the office since 2013.\n\nA bullseye for Biden or a misfire?\n\nGun control is an issue Democrats in Washington always talk about but seldom are able to do much about. Part of this is the reality of congressional gridlock, which allows Republicans in the US Senate to block any substantive legislation on the topic. There is also a fear among Democrats that guns are an electoral liability. They worry that firearm-rights activists are more likely to punish them for new legislation than gun-control proponents are to reward them.\n\nAnd so Democratic-backed changes, at least on the national level, are made on the margins. Such is the case with the administration move to regulate ghost guns, which at the moment play a relatively small part in the rise of US gun violence.\n\nIt is an area, however, where the Biden administration can act on its own, without congressional support. The president can tout an accomplishment that may placate supporters concerned that gun control has languished on the back-burner during the first half of his presidency.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/21/politics/fact-check-biden-guns-africa/index.html', 'Headline': 'Fact check: Biden makes 5 false claims about guns, plus some about ...', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden made false claims about a variety of topics, notably including gun policy, during a series of official speeches and campaign remarks over the last two weeks.', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden made false claims about a variety of topics, notably including gun policy, during a series of official speeches and campaign remarks over the last two weeks.\n\nHe made at least five false claims related to guns, a subject on which he has repeatedly been inaccurate during his presidency. He also made a false claim about the extent of his support from environmental groups. And he used incorrect figures about the population of Africa, his own travel history and how much renewable energy Texas uses.\n\nHere is a fact check of these claims, plus a fact check on a Biden exaggeration about guns. The White House declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nGuns\n\nBeau Biden and red flag laws\n\nIn a Friday speech at the National Safer Communities Summit in Connecticut, Biden spoke of how a gun control law he signed in 2022 has provided federal funding for states to expand the use of gun control tools like “red flag” laws, which allow the courts to temporarily seize the guns of people who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. After mentioning red flag laws, Biden invoked his late son Beau Biden, who served as attorney general of Delaware, and said: “As my son was the first to enforce when he was attorney general.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. Delaware did not have a red flag law when Beau Biden was state attorney general from 2007 to 2015. The legislation that created Delaware’s red flag program was named the Beau Biden Gun Violence Prevention Act, but it was passed in 2018, three years after Beau Biden died of brain cancer. (In 2013, Beau Biden had pushed for a similar bill, but it was rejected by the state Senate.) The president has previously said, correctly, that a Delaware red flag law was named after his son.\n\nDelaware was far from the first state to enact a red flag law. Connecticut passed the first such state law in the country in 1999.\n\nStabilizing braces\n\nIn the same speech, the president spoke confusingly of his administration’s effort to make it more difficult for Americans to purchase stabilizing braces, devices that are attached to the rear of pistols, most commonly AR-15-style pistols, and make it easier to fire them one-handed.\n\n“Put a pistol on a brace, and it…turns into a gun,” Biden said. “Makes them where you can have a higher-caliber weapon – a higher-caliber bullet – coming out of that gun. It’s essentially turning it into a short-barreled rifle, which has been a weapon of choice by a number of mass shooters.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claims that a stabilizing brace turns a pistol into a gun and increases the caliber of a gun or bullet are false. A pistol is, obviously, already a gun, and “a pistol brace does not have any effect on the caliber of ammunition that a gun fires or anything about the basic functioning of the gun itself,” said Stephen Gutowski, a CNN contributor who is the founder of the gun policy and politics website The Reload.\n\nBiden’s assertion that the addition of a stabilizing brace can “essentially” turn a pistol into a short-barreled rifle is subjective; it’s the same argument his administration’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has made in support of its attempt to subject the braces to new controls. The administration’s regulatory effort is being challenged in the courts by gun rights advocates.\n\nGun manufacturers and lawsuits\n\nRepeating a claim he made in his 2022 State of the Union address and on other occasions, Biden said at a campaign fundraiser in California on Monday: “The only industry in America you can’t sue is the – is the gun manufacturers.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false, as CNN and other fact-checkers have previously noted. Gun manufacturers are not entirely exempt from being sued, nor are they the only industry with some liability protections. Notably, there are significant liability protections for vaccine manufacturers and, at present, for people and entities involved in making, distributing or administering Covid-19 countermeasures such as vaccines, tests and treatments.\n\nUnder the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, gun manufacturers cannot be held liable for the use of their products in crimes. However, gun manufacturers can still be held liable for (and thus sued for) a range of things, including negligence, breach of contract regarding the purchase of a gun or certain damages from defects in the design of a gun.\n\nIn 2019, the Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit against gun manufacturer Remington Arms Co. to continue. The plaintiffs, a survivor and the families of nine other victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, wanted to hold the company – which manufactured the semi-automatic rifle that was used in the 2012 killing – partly responsible by targeting the company’s marketing practices, another area where gun manufacturers can be held liable. In 2022, those families reached a $73 million settlement with the company and its four insurers.\n\nThere are also more recent lawsuits against gun manufacturers. For example, the parents of some of the victims and survivors of the 2022 massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, have sued over the marketing practices of the company that made the gun used by the killer. Another suit, filed by the government of Buffalo, New York, in December over gun violence in the city, alleges that the actions of several gun manufacturers and distributors have endangered public health and safety. It is unclear how those lawsuits will fare in the courts.\n\n– Holmes Lybrand contributed to this item.\n\nThe NRA and lawsuits\n\nAt a campaign fundraiser in California on Tuesday, Biden said the National Rifle Association, the prominent gun rights advocacy organization, itself cannot be sued.\n\n“And the fact that the NRA has such overwhelming power – you know, the NRA is the only outfit in the nation that we cannot sue as an institution,” Biden said. “They got – they – before this – I became president, they passed legislation saying you can’t sue them. Imagine had that been the case with tobacco companies.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. While gun manufacturers have liability protections, no law was ever passed to forbid lawsuits against the NRA. The NRA has faced a variety of lawsuits in recent years.\n\nMachine guns\n\nAt the same Tuesday fundraiser in California, Biden said that he taught the Second Amendment in law school, “And guess what? It doesn’t say that you can own any weapon you want. It says there are certain weapons that you just can’t own.” One example Biden cited was this: “You can’t own a machine gun.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. The Second Amendment does not explicitly say people cannot own certain weapons – and the courts have not interpreted it to forbid machine guns. In fact, with some exceptions, people in more than two-thirds of states are allowed to own and buy fully automatic machine guns as long as those guns were legally registered and possessed prior to May 19, 1986, the day President Ronald Reagan signed a major gun law. There were more than 700,000 legally registered machine guns in the US as of May 2021, according to official federal data.\n\nFederal law imposes significant national restrictions on machine gun purchases, and the fact that there is a limited pool of pre-May 19, 1986 machine guns means that buying these guns tends to be expensive – regularly into the tens of thousands of dollars. But for Americans in most of the country, Biden’s claim that you simply “can’t” own a machine gun, period, is not true.\n\n“It’s not easy to obtain a fully automatic machine gun today, I don’t want to give that impression – but it is certainly legal. And it’s always been legal,” Gutowski said in March, when Biden previously made this claim about machine guns.\n\nCalifornia, where Biden made this remark on Tuesday, has strict laws restricting machine guns, but there is a legal process even there to apply for a state permit to possess one.\n\nThe ‘boyfriend loophole’\n\nIn the Friday speech to the National Safer Communities Summit, Biden said “we fought like hell to close the so-called boyfriend loophole” that had allowed people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence to buy and possess guns if the victim was not someone they were married to, living with or had a child with. Biden then said that now “we finally can say that those convicted of domestic violence abuse against their girlfriend or boyfriend cannot buy a firearm, period.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s categorical claim that such offenders now “cannot buy a firearm, period” is an exaggeration, though Biden did sign a law in 2022 that made significant progress in closing the “boyfriend loophole.” That 2022 law added “dating” partners to the list of misdemeanor domestic violence offenders who are generally prohibited from gun purchases – but in a concession demanded by Republicans, the law says these offenders can buy a gun five years after their first conviction or completion of their sentence, whichever comes later, if they do not reoffend in the interim.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the law’s new restriction on dating partners applies only to people who committed the domestic violence against a someone with whom they were in or “recently” had been in a “continuing” and “serious” romantic or intimate relationship. In other words, it omits people whose offense was against partners from their past or someone they dated casually.\n\nMarium Durrani, vice president of policy at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said there are “definitely some gaps” in the law, “so it’s not a blanket end-all be-all,” but she said it is “really a step in the right direction.”\n\nBiden’s endorsements from environmental organizations\n\nBiden said at a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Saturday: “Let me just say one thing very seriously. You know, I think this is the first time – and I’ve been around, as I said, a while – in history where, last week, every single environmental organization endorsed me.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that every single environmental organization had endorsed Biden. Four major environmental organizations did endorse him the week prior, the first time they had issued a joint endorsement, but other well-known environmental organizations have not yet endorsed in the presidential election.\n\nThe four groups that endorsed Biden together in mid-June were the Sierra Club, NextGen PAC, and the campaign arms of the League of Conservation Voters and the Natural Resources Defense Council. That is not a complete list of every single environmental group in the country. For example, Environmental Defense Fund, The Nature Conservancy, the National Audubon Society, Earthjustice and Greenpeace, in addition to some lesser-known groups, have not issued presidential endorsements to date.\n\nBiden’s claim of an endorsement from every environmental group comes amid frustration from some activists over his recent approvals of fossil fuel projects.\n\nThe population of Africa\n\nIn official speeches last Tuesday and last Wednesday and at a press conference the week prior, Biden claimed that Africa’s population would soon reach 1 billion. “You know, soon – soon, Africa will have 1 billion people,” he said last Wednesday.\n\nFacts First: This is false. Africa’s population exceeded 1 billion in 2009, according to United Nations figures; it is now more than 1.4 billion. Sub-Saharan Africa alone has a population of more than 1.1 billion.\n\nTexas and energy\n\nAt a campaign fundraiser in Connecticut on Friday, Biden spoke about reading recent news articles about the use of renewable energy sources in Texas. He said, “I think it’s 70% of all their energy produced by solar and wind because it is significantly cheaper. Cheaper. Cheaper.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s “70%” figure is not close to correct. The federal Energy Information Administration projected late last year that Texas would meet 37% of its electricity demand in 2023 with wind and solar power, up from 30% in 2022.\n\nTexas has indeed been a leader in renewable energy, particularly wind power, but the state is far from getting more than two-thirds of its energy from wind and solar alone. The organization that provides electricity to 90% of the state has a web page where you can see its current energy mix in real time; when we looked on Wednesday afternoon, during a heat wave, the mix included 15.8% solar, 10.2% wind and 6.6% nuclear, while 67.1% was natural gas or coal and lignite.\n\nBiden’s visits to Iraq and Afghanistan\n\nIn his Friday speech at the National Safer Communities Summit, Biden made a muddled claim about his past visits to Afghanistan and Iraq – saying that “you know, I spent a lot of time as president, and I spent 30-some times – visits – many more days in Afghanistan and Iraq.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim that he has visited Afghanistan and Iraq “30-some times” is false – the latest in a long-running series of exaggerations about his visits to the two countries. His presidential campaign said in 2019 that he made 21 visits to these countries, but he has since continued to put the figure in the 30s. And he has not visited either country “as president.”\n\nBiden’s travels with Xi Jinping\n\nAt another campaign fundraiser in California on Monday, Biden reprised a familiar claim about his travels with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who is, like him, a former vice president.\n\n“It wasn’t appropriate for Barack to be able to spend a lot of time getting to know him, so it was an assignment I was given. And I traveled 17,000 miles with him, usually one on one,” Biden said.\n\nFacts First: Biden’s “17,000 miles” claim remains false. Biden has not traveled anywhere close to 17,000 miles with Xi, though they have indeed spent lots of time together. This is one of Biden’s most common false claims as president, a figure he has repeated over and over in speeches despite numerous fact checks.\n\nWashington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler noted in 2021 that Biden and Xi often did not even travel parallel routes to their gatherings, let alone physically travel together. The only apparent way to get Biden’s mileage past 17,000, Kessler found, is to add the length of Biden’s flight journeys between Washington and Beijing, during which Xi was not with him.\n\nA White House official told CNN in early 2021 that Biden was adding up his “total travel back and forth” for meetings with Xi. But that is very different than traveling “with him” as Biden keeps saying, especially in the context of his boasts about how well he knows Xi. Biden has had more than enough time to make his language more precise.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Ghost guns Biden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/us/supreme-court-biden-ghost-guns.html', 'Headline': 'By 5-4 Vote, Supreme Court Revives Biden’s Regulation of ‘Ghost Guns’', 'Snippet': 'The Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily revived the Biden administration’s regulation of “ghost guns” — kits that can be bought online and assembled into untraceable homemade firearms ...', 'Full_text': 'The Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily revived the Biden administration’s regulation of “ghost guns” — kits that can be bought online and assembled into untraceable homemade firearms.\n\nIn defending the rule, a key part of President Biden’s broader effort to address gun violence, administration officials said such weapons had soared in popularity in recent years, particularly among criminals barred from buying ordinary guns.\n\nThe court’s brief order gave no reasons, which is typical when the justices act on emergency applications. The order was provisional, leaving the regulation in place while a challenge moves forward in the courts.\n\nThe vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G.

The new rule will go through the federal rulemaking process.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Thursday that the move is a result of the bipartisan law passed by Congress last year.\n\n“The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was passed by Congress to reduce gun violence, including by expanding the background checks that keep guns out of the hands of criminals,” he said. “This proposed rule implements Congress’s mandate to expand the definition of who must obtain a license and conduct a background check before selling firearms.”\n\nThe ""gun show loophole"" has been cited for years as a major hole in the federal background check system, allowing a vast number of private sales without background checks. The ATF currently licenses about 80,000 brick-and-mortar gun dealers, but gun sales are increasingly taking place outside that system, free of background checks.\n\nEarlier this year, Biden signed an executive order designed to expand background checks. It directed Garland to clarify the statutory definition of who is “engaged in the business” of selling firearms, an authority an administration official said was detailed in the bipartisan gun law.\n\nNBC News reported last year about some of the provisions of the law that led to Thursday\'s proposed rule. At the time, however, sources close to the negotiations behind the legislation tempered expectations that it could close the gun show loophole or have a significant effect on the sale of guns online, although they hoped it would bolster enforcement and oversight of the firearms market.\n\nThe sources said they had in mind the shooter in Midland-Odessa, Texas, who killed eight people in 2019 with a gun that he bought through a private sale. He had previously failed a background check from a licensed gun seller and was not allowed to buy a weapon.\n\nBiden touted the bipartisan legislation in June, a year after he signed it into law, saying that it was already saving lives.\n\nThe president said the law has allowed the Justice Department to run enhanced background checks through the FBI on adults under 21 who try to buy firearms. It has also provided funding to states to expand the so-called red flag laws that allow courts to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a danger to themselves or others. And it has provided money to states to boost mental health services, especially for young people. Biden also noted that the law closed the so-called boyfriend loophole by keeping guns away from unmarried dating partners convicted of abuse.\n\nBiden has long made it a priority to enact policies focused on curbing gun violence. He and then-President Barack Obama attempted to push Congress to pass such measures, and the closest it came was in 2013, a few months after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The Senate fell six votes short of advancing a bill by Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would have required background checks in all commercial gun sales.\n\nSince becoming president, while still pressuring Congress to pass legislation, Biden has also used his executive authority to try to reduce gun violence, although he faces limits. He has repeatedly called on lawmakers to pass another assault weapons ban in the wake of several mass shootings.\n\nThere\'s little chance of such a measure passing through both chambers of Congress. Republicans narrowly control the House, and Democrats have a thin majority in the Senate, meaning they would need substantial Republican support to overcome a filibuster.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-another-life-saving-step-keep-guns-out', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Takes Another Life-Saving Step ...', 'Snippet': 'Why the Biden-Harris Administration is Taking Action.

Today, as a result of the Executive Order and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the Department of Justice is taking life-saving action to reduce the number of guns sold without background checks and keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\n\nWhy the Biden-Harris Administration is Taking Action\n\nSince 1994, federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon. These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more than three million felons, convicted domestic abusers, and other dangerous individuals. However, despite the law, individuals who should be licensed dealers have refused to obtain a license, skirting the background check requirement.\n\nLast year, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law bipartisan legislation to help address this dangerous problem by modifying the definition of who has to become a federally licensed firearms dealer. Members of Congress—both Democrats and Republicans—made clear that they intended for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to better protect the American people from gun violence by clarifying when someone is supposed to become a licensed firearms dealer.\n\nNew Action to Keep Guns Out of Dangerous Hands\n\nToday, the Justice Department has announced a proposed rule to specify what exactly the new definition in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act means on the ground. If finalized, this proposed rule would mean the following for people who are not selling guns in order to make money: If you have a gun you no longer need, and you want to sell it to your family member, you do not need a license to sell it. If you buy and sell curios or relics or ""collectible"" personal firearms as a hobby, again, you do not need a license. But, if you are offering a firearm for sale to make money, and telling a customer that you can purchase and sell him additional firearms, you would presumptively need a license—and need to run background checks. The same is true if you repetitively offer for resale firearms within 30 days of when you purchased them. The proposed rule includes a number of other situations where, in civil and administrative proceedings and absent reliable evidence to the contrary, it will be presumed that you need a license.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed rule, if finalized, would clarify that an individual would be presumed to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms—and therefore be required to become a licensed firearms dealer and run background checks—if they meet certain conditions. For example, under the proposed rule, a person would be presumed to be required to become a licensed dealer and run background checks if they meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\nOffer for sale any number of firearms and also represents to potential buyers that they are willing and able to purchase and sell them additional firearms;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms within 30 days after they were purchased:\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms that are like new in their original packaging;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale multiple firearms of the same make and model; or\n\nAs a formerly federally-licensed firearms dealer, sell firearms that were in the business inventory and not transferred to a personal collection at least a year before the sale, addressing the so-called ""fire sale loophole.""\n\nThe proposed rule would also clarify that, for civil or administrative actions, an individual would be presumed to have the intent to ""predominantly earn a profit""—one of the elements of engaging in the business of dealing firearms—if the person engages in activities such as:\n\nCreating a website or making business cards to advertise or market a firearms business;\n\nMaintaining records to document and track profits and losses from firearms purchases or sales; or\n\nPurchasing business insurance or renting space at a gun show.\n\nThe proposed rule would make clear that there is no ""gun show loophole"" or ""internet loophole"" in federal law. Dealers who engage in the business of selling guns are required to obtain a license and run background checks no matter where they engage in the business of buying and selling firearms. That include at gun shows and over the Internet.\n\nThe proposed rule is now open for public comment. The Department of Justice will consider the comments it receives in deciding on a final rule.\n\nContinuing to Call on Congress to Act\n\nThis rule is a significant step toward reducing the percentage of firearms sold for profit without background checks. It builds on previous Biden-Harris Administration actions to save lives and combat the epidemic of gun violence.\n\nHowever, to fully address this problem, Congress must act. The President continues to call on Congress to enact universal background checks legislation, as well as other commonsense legislation to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of guns, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. These are life-saving measures that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support to protect our Country from the threat of gun violence.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/06/qa-on-bidens-gun-proposals/', 'Headline': ""Q&A on Biden's Gun Proposals - FactCheck.org"", 'Snippet': 'Over that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.', 'Full_text': 'In a prime-time speech to the nation, President Joe Biden spoke about gun violence and his proposals to reduce it. Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60251356', 'Headline': ""'Ghost guns' in crosshairs of Biden firearms fight - BBC News"", 'Snippet': 'The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) said that 10,000 were recovered in 2019.

It’s locked. I have a person with me – military with me. I read it, I lock it back up, and give it to the military.”\n\nBiden was responding to a question about whether it was ever appropriate for a president to take top-secret documents home. Weeks earlier, the FBI had searched former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, uncovering hundreds of classified and top-secret documents.\n\n“It depends on the document,” Biden said. “And it depends on how secure the room is.”\n\nThe security of Biden’s house in Wilmington is now at the center of a special counsel investigation into his handling of classified material after documents with classification markings were found at two locations at the house: in the garage and an adjacent room. Neither of those areas seem to fit with Biden’s description of a secure “cabined-off space” for classified materials.\n\nBiden gave the go-ahead for his lawyers to conduct the search, according to people familiar with the matter, but wasn’t present himself as they looked through various rooms, including his personal library.\n\nThat find followed an initial discovery in November of 10 classified documents, including US intelligence memos and briefing papers dating to the Obama administration, inside a closet at a former private office Biden kept in downtown Washington.\n\nAfter a December search found a “small number” of records with classified markings in the garage, a third discovery was made at the Wilmington house in January, when Biden’s legal team searched the rest of the property for documents. They found them, in a room adjacent to the garage.\n\n“We found a handful of documents were filed in the wrong place,” Biden explained Thursday during a tour of storm damage in California.\n\n“I think you’re going to find there’s nothing there. I have no regrets,” he went on, insisting the American people were focused elsewhere. “I’m following what the lawyers are telling me they want me to do. It’s exactly what we’re doing. There’s no there there.”\n\nThough Biden insists the classified documents were in a “locked” garage, the full scope of who may have had access to them is a central question – not only for special counsel Robert Hur but House Republicans, who have put Biden’s handling of classified material atop a lengthy list of investigative targets aimed at Biden and his administration.\n\n“That would essentially be a crime scene, so to speak, after the appointment of a special counsel,” Rep. James Comer, the newly minted Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” about Biden’s home in Delaware.\n\nA working home\n\nFor years, Biden has conducted critical – and sometimes classified – business from his three-bedroom, four-bathroom white Colonial in the leafy outskirts of Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nHis decades as a senator, including stints as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, all featured weekend train rides home from Washington. The tradition continued as vice president. A secure facility was built inside his lakefront property so Biden could handle classified material securely.\n\nThe gable-roofed Biden home, situated among large estates in the wealthiest area of Delaware, is far from easily accessible. It can’t be seen from the road. And, while Biden was vice president and again as president, the premises have been tightly controlled by Secret Service.\n\nBut for years in between, security was reduced significantly at the Wilmington home.\n\nIn mid-2017, when Biden’s time as a federal protectee ended, Secret Service agents who had been stationed at the house for years finally left. The secure facility Biden used to view classified materials as vice president was also eventually removed. It wasn’t until March 2020, as Biden moved closer to becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, that Secret Service protection resumed.\n\nExactly when the classified documents first arrived in Biden’s garage remains an open question. The government provided Biden 5,300 square feet of office space in downtown Washington for several months after his vice presidency. Biden’s transition team vacated that space on July 21, 2017, according to a statement by the General Services Administration.\n\nCongressional Republicans have demanded visitor logs of his home and even questioned whether Biden’s son Hunter, who used the Wilmington address on a driver’s license, may have had access to the documents when he was engaged in foreign business.\n\nIt’s unclear how much time Hunter Biden spent at the Wilmington house in the months leading up to his father’s campaign launch. According to Hunter’s memoir, “Beautiful Things,” the house was the site of a tearful family intervention over Hunter’s drug addiction in 2019. In his book, Hunter writes that he got on a plane to California after the intervention and that he landed in LA in March 2019.\n\nBoth the White House counsel’s office and the US Secret Service said Monday there are no visitors logs that track guests who come and go at Biden’s home in Wilmington.\n\n“Like every President across decades of modern history, his personal residence is personal,” the White House counsel’s office said in a statement Monday morning. “But upon taking office, President Biden restored the norm and tradition of keeping White House visitors logs, including publishing them regularly, after the previous administration ended them.”\n\nBiden and his wife Jill purchased the home’s four-acre lot in 1996 for $350,000, according to property records from New Castle County. They built a 6,850-square foot home with three bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms. Biden designed the house himself and even did the landscaping, including planting Leland Cypress trees that later nearly died in a drought.\n\nThe family moved in around Christmas 1998.\n\nInside the property, there’s a pool, a library with Chesterfield sofas, and a sunroom overlooking a small man-made lake, which was constructed by one the area’s wealthiest families, the du Ponts.\n\nBiden’s sister Val Biden Owens had a home nearby across the state line in Pennsylvania, and former Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman, a close friend and one of Biden’s longest-serving advisers, lived a few minutes away.\n\nWhen Biden’s eldest son Beau was battling brain cancer, Biden considered putting a second mortgage on the Wilmington home to help his son with expenses related to his treatment.\n\nWhen Biden told then-President Barack Obama about the situation, Obama offered to lend him money instead, according to Biden’s memoir, “Promise Me, Dad.” According to Biden’s retelling in the book, Obama said, “Don’t do that. I’ll give you the money. I have it. You can pay me back whenever.”\n\nPost-vice presidency\n\nAfter his vice presidential term, Biden spent more time in Wilmington, which put him closer to his late son Beau’s children. The Bidens also purchased a seaside escape in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, the summer after leaving the White House, using part of an advance for Biden’s planned book to buy the home.\n\nBut Biden split much of his time between Wilmington and a rented a mansion in McLean, the wealthy enclave in Northern Virginia that’s home to many a former senator. The couple wanted to keep a base in the Washington area while Jill continued teaching at Northern Virginia Community College. Aides would often say Biden simply wanted to be wherever his wife was.\n\nThe proximity to the nation’s capital allowed him to meet regularly with advisers as they charted out his political future and pop over to the Penn Biden Center think tank when meeting with lawmakers or foreign leaders. Being in the DC area also gave him easy access to his granddaughter Maisy’s soccer games.\n\nBut the Wilmington house remained the center of family activities, and it was there that Biden’s eldest granddaughter, Naomi Biden, called a family meeting where the grandkids urged their “Pop” to run for president a third time.\n\nAs Biden’s presidential run got underway, he spent more time at the Wilmington home while off the campaign trail, eventually moving out of the McLean house several months into the campaign, sources said.\n\nWhen the Covid-19 pandemic pushed Americans into isolation, Biden retreated to the Wilmington home. In March 2020, a small group of campaign aides carefully wore masks and gloves as they set up a makeshift studio in his basement where Biden could make zoom appearances and conduct interviews. That same month, Secret Service protection resumed as Biden inched closer to securing the Democratic nomination.\n\nIn person meetings with advisers were traded for conference calls with only a limited amount of staff coming to and from the house. Biden interviewed most of his possible running mates over video chat, eventually calling Kamala Harris, at the time a Democratic senator representing California, from his private library in the Wilmington residence to inform her she was his pick.\n\nMonths later, when election night stretched into election week, the Biden family, including Hunter, Ashley, their spouses and the grandchildren, hunkered down at the home watching election results. Hunter Biden recounted that when the race was called for Biden, “Mom and Dad were on a dock out on the pond, so we all ran to the porch and screamed at the top of our lungs, ‘We won! We just won!’”\n\nBack at the White House\n\nWhen Biden was elected president, Secret Service ramped up its presence in Wilmington. Now, the two-lane road that feeds into his private driveway is monitored by officers and agents, and access to the home tightly controlled. Visitors are screened and surveillance is around-the-clock.\n\nBiden has made 61 visits to Delaware since taking office and spent some or all of 196 days in Delaware during his presidency. This includes visits to his homes in Wilmington and in Rehoboth Beach. The Bidens are set to spend the upcoming weekend at their Rehoboth Beach home.\n\nAs President, Biden has made his Wilmington home a weekend White House. From there, he’s phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin and breakfasted with West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.\n\nPeople familiar with the president’s working style say he conducts plenty of business from his home in Wilmington and that he always travels with a National Security Council aide.\n\nHe sometimes incorporates a trip to Delaware into his daily schedule. On a Friday in mid-December, he went there twice.\n\nThat afternoon, Biden appeared at an event at the Major Joseph R. “Beau” Biden III National Guard/Reserve Center in New Castle, Delaware, to speak about improving veterans’ health care benefits and funding for veterans exposed to toxins during their time serving in the military. Biden then traveled back to the White House for a few hours, in part for a holiday party, before returning to Delaware that evening, motorcading to his residence in Wilmington – a 15-minute drive from the National Guard center where he delivered remarks earlier that day.\n\nDuring that final weekend in Wilmington ahead of the Christmas holiday, Biden visited a shopping center, attended mass and visited the gravesite of his late wife Neilia and daughter Naomi to mark the 50th anniversary of their tragic deaths. By late Monday morning, the president returned to Washington.\n\nThe next day, as Biden prepared for a secretive visit from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – his lawyers were at the house in Wilmington searching for classified materials. Hunting around the garage, they came across a “small number” of documents with classified markings, not far from where he stores in 1967 Stingray Corvette.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.skynews.com.au/world-news/americas-nursing-home-joe-bidens-cognitive-decline-and-the-ageing-faces-of-politics/video/21a0405a20c6b8e179ac4f0703aa34a9', 'Headline': 'America’s Nursing Home: Joe Biden’s cognitive decline and the ageing ...', 'Snippet': ""There has been a particular focus on the decline of President Joe Biden's mental fitness at the age of 80.

Bauer also said the FBI took some handwritten notes from Biden’s days as vice president, and some additional materials to review, like agents did during a search of Biden’s Wilmington home in January.\n\nThe search is reminiscent of the FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago, former President Donald Trump’s Florida home, but the two are vastly different. According to Bauer, the search was planned, and was conducted with Biden’s “full support and cooperation.” That aligns with reporting that a warrant was not needed for the FBI to do their work. In Trump’s case, the FBI did their work without his cooperation — and with a warrant.\n\nThe latest developments in Biden’s case fit the bigger picture of a White House that has been cooperating with the Justice Department from the start, and one that’s tried to avoid the perception that Biden is unduly influencing the investigation. In part to maintain an air of distance, the Biden inquiry is now being led by Robert Hur, a special counsel whom Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed in January but who officially began work Wednesday.\n\nThat means two special counsels are running parallel but separate investigations into a current and a former president. Garland appointed special counsel Jack Smith to investigate whether Trump broke laws by mishandling classified materials (the FBI recovered hundreds of documents marked as classified from Mar-a-Lago) and obstructed justice by not cooperating with the investigation.\n\nWhether either leader faces any legal repercussions for advertently or inadvertently holding on to classified documents remains to be seen. Trump, as a private citizen, could be charged for inappropriately handling documents related to national defense, and for potentially impeding the FBI’s investigation. Biden may have run afoul of the Presidential Records Act, but there’s not really a punishment for that, given that he also handed over the material. So far, the growing focus on Biden’s documents hasn’t hurt him politically, and doesn’t look likely to. As campaigning for the 2024 election begins, however, that could always change.\n\nA brief recap of the classified documents saga\n\nTrump and Biden aren’t the only elected officials who had classified documents at home. Representatives for former vice president (and possible 2024 presidential candidate) Mike Pence told the National Archives, the agency in charge of storing classified records once a presidency ends, that a lawyer had found “a small number of documents bearing classified markings” at Pence’s Indiana home in January. The National Archives then contacted the FBI, which worked with Pence’s legal team to hand over the documents.\n\nThose documents were apparently not stored in a secure area but had been taped up in boxes during the former vice president’s move back to Indiana. Once they were discovered, the documents were moved to a secure place in Pence’s house until the FBI picked them up, according to CNN. Pence, as a private citizen who cooperated with officials, is not under a formal investigation, but has said he would cooperate should any be launched.\n\nBiden’s document saga started when a batch of materials with classified markings was discovered at Biden’s DC think tank and office, the Penn Biden Center, on November 2, less than a week before the midterm elections. All 10 documents were from Biden’s time as vice president. The president’s lawyers told the White House Counsel’s office, which informed the National Archives, which collected them the next day. According to CBS News, the FBI then searched the offices in mid-November. None of this was made public until January.\n\nBiden’s team also searched other locations for more potential documents later in December, and a “small number” of additional records were found in Biden’s Wilmington home, including a storage space in the garage. The FBI did its search of that home on January 20, and the White House announced it the next day. About six items were found and taken by the FBI, along with some other handwritten notes.\n\nThe investigation into Trump began, as my colleague Andrew Prokop has previously explained, when the National Archives discovered it was missing some sensitive information. After requesting the files from Trump, some were returned; others weren’t. That led to a subpoena (that seems to have been disregarded), the warrant, raid, and ultimately, Smith’s inquiry. At least 300 classified documents were recovered from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe investigations haven’t made much of an impact on the American people\n\nBecause both Biden and Pence have discovered classified documents, and because of the high-profile investigations now going on, the National Archives has formally asked former presidents and vice presidents to check their records for any classified material or records from their time in office.\n\nThe National Archives is in charge of storing those materials after an administration ends, in accordance with the Presidential Records Act — a law that applies to the last six presidential administrations since Ronald Reagan’s presidency. The law does not apply to Jimmy Carter, who was president before Reagan.\n\nThese requests, the nature of classification (advocates for greater government transparency have long argued that the federal government tends to overclassify materials), and apparent insularity of these legal issues to the Beltway all seem to be contributing to the way the American people are viewing these investigations.\n\nStill, Republicans in Congress and conservative media have seized on the slow trickle of developments in Biden’s document case to try to nullify some of the scrutiny surrounding Trump’s investigation, by downplaying the severity of Trump’s case, falsely equating the two to show a double standard, or trying to create pretext for eventual congressional investigations. Rep. James Comer (R-KY), the chair of the House Oversight Committee, has already targeted the Penn Biden Center for investigation, and used the searches of Biden’s home as reasons to ask for records of any visitors or guests to those places. (Some congressional Democrats are also demanding more information on Biden’s classified documents, though not to attack the president politically.)\n\nThough recent polling by CBS News, CNN, and NBC News show that Americans say they are concerned with the discovery of these Biden documents, the president’s overall approval rating has hardly changed. Views of Trump’s response to investigations remain negative, according to the same surveys.\n\nQuinnipiac polling shows a similar landscape: Large majorities think Biden mishandled documents and think the issue is a serious one to investigate, but don’t think Biden should be criminally responsible for it. “Roughly two-thirds of Americans are aware of and troubled by the misplaced classified documents found in President Biden’s home and private office. But is it a criminal case? No,” Quinnipiac pollster Tim Malloy said in that poll release.\n\nThe polling suggests Americans also see differences between Biden’s case and Trump’s, and Biden’s cooperation with investigators. And, unsurprisingly, the answer to questions about how Trump and Biden have behaved in response to these probes changes depending on whether you ask Republicans or Democrats about each man.\n\nEssentially, though the discoveries raise serious questions about security and presidents’ care with secrets, neither seems to be changing the way Americans view either Trump or Biden — at least for now.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.skynews.com.au/world-news/united-states/joe-biden-grilled-by-reporters-about-classified-documents-found-inside-garage-of-delaware-home-as-white-house-pledges-to-cooperate-in-investigation/news-story/70f759dfb686f3ff8223d17ffdb35229', 'Headline': 'President Joe Biden grilled by reporters about classified documents ...', 'Snippet': 'United States President Joe Biden has been grilled by reporters over the discovery of more classified documents found at his Delaware home.', 'Full_text': 'United States President Joe Biden has been grilled by reporters over the discovery of more classified documents found at his Delaware home.\n\nThe White House announced on Thursday (local time) a ""small number"" of secret materials from his time as Barack Obama\'s vice president was discovered in the garage.\n\n""During the review, the lawyers discovered among personal and political papers a small number of additional Obama-Biden Administration records with classified markings,"" the President\'s special counsel Richard Sauber said in a statement.\n\nDays earlier it was revealed the first batch of government documents were found at the Penn Biden Centre for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in November 2022.\n\nStream more US news live & on demand with Flash. 25+ news channels in 1 place.

They found more documents in his Wilmington garage on Dec. 20, and another in his home on Jan. 11. On Jan. 14, a White House lawyer found additional material.\n\nThe FBI search of Biden\'s residence was kept under wraps until Saturday evening because the Justice Department requested it be private, Bauer said in his statement.\n\nBauer said that Biden\'s representatives ""offered to provide prompt access"" to the Department of Justice to search Biden\'s home for documents.\n\nThey went through decades of notes, files, memorabilia and to-do lists\n\nSearchers, according to Bauer, went through ""personally handwritten notes, files, papers, binders, memorabilia, to-do lists, schedules, and reminders going back decades"" and ""took possession of materials it deemed within the scope of its inquiry.""\n\nThat included ""six items consisting of documents with classification markings and surrounding materials,"" some of which dated back to Biden\'s time in the Senate, Bauer said.

They travel home to Wilmington on most weekends, as Biden has done throughout his time in public office.

""He often travels to Delaware on the weekends. I just don\'t have anything else to share,"" Jean-Pierre replied.\n\nNPR\'s Carrie Johnson contributed to this story.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/13/biden-classified-documents-wilmington-home/', 'Headline': ""Document discovery spotlights Biden's frequent use of Wilmington home ..."", 'Snippet': 'The home owned by Joe and Jill Biden by the lake in Wilmington, Del., as seen in 2019. The smaller home in the front left was built for his mother in 2005. (Pictometry International)', 'Full_text': 'WILMINGTON, Del. — President Biden had wrapped up a routine weekend visit to his home here in December, one that included pre-Christmas errands at a local strip mall, a stop at his nearby golf club and an evening Mass at a church that sits five minutes from his house. But the day after he left and returned to Washington, his lawyers alerted the Justice Department to some troubling news: Inside the garage, they had located a batch of classified documents that dated to Biden’s time as vice president.\n\nThat finding has set off a political furor and prompted Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel. But beyond that, it has drawn attention to what has become a de facto extension of the White House, a place where Biden goes most weekends in an attempt to maintain the routine he has kept throughout his political career.\n\nIt has been a dream home that he and his wife constructed. It has been a cozy retreat where he spent months of covid quarantine and ran a winning campaign. It has been the scene of family celebrations and family strife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, it is the scene of a special counsel investigation.\n\nBiden often travels with a National Security Council aide, and accommodations have been made on the property so that he can handle classified materials and conduct secure phone calls. Ironically, those security accommodations — where he as president is allowed to deal with classified matters — are on the same property as the garage that held classified materials he was not authorized to have.\n\nThat two-car garage is where he keeps his prized open-top 1967 Stingray Corvette, a gift from his father for his first wedding with the engine rebuilt by his sons for Christmas. In a video released by his campaign in August 2020, Biden is seen backing the car into the garage, where a messy pile of materials appears to include a cardboard box and a lampshade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked this week why sensitive materials were found in the same area as he keeps his car, Biden retorted, “By the way, my Corvette’s in a locked garage, okay, so it’s not like it’s sitting out in the street. As I said earlier this week, people know that I take classified documents and classified materials seriously.”\n\nThe idea of going home on the weekends, and even evenings, is hard-wired into Biden’s political identity. He started the practice when he first came to Washington — becoming a senator in 1973 shortly after his wife and daughter died in a car crash — when he took the train home each night to Delaware to be with his sons as they recovered.\n\nBiden has largely kept that approach as president, using the White House as perhaps the country’s highest-profile version of corporate housing. He travels home most weekends, easing into a predictable routine of golf, family dinners and church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he was home in December, he stepped into a local Jos. A. Bank for the second time in several months. He made a brief stop at Fieldstone Golf Club and attended Mass on Saturday night before returning to his house. As his family that weekend marked the 50th anniversary of the crash that killed his wife and daughter, he was joined by nearly everyone in his immediate family, including his son Hunter, daughter Ashley and a half-dozen grandchildren.\n\nBiden left Wilmington that Monday, and the next day, Dec. 20, is when Biden’s lawyers informed the Justice Department that the additional documents had been found in the garage, according to Garland. That triggered the FBI to go to the home and secure the documents.\n\nBiden was also at the house last weekend. On Wednesday, his lawyers said they had discovered another classified document in a room adjacent to the garage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Of course the president has facilitated access to his residence to his personal lawyers so they can conduct the searches to ensure any records are properly in possession of the government,” White House spokesman Ian Sams said.\n\nTimeline of Biden documents\n\nThe White House on Friday did not respond to questions about whether the documents found at Biden’s home were left there when he was vice president, or were simply stored in his home after he left office. Biden himself was not involved in the discovery of the documents, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject.\n\nDuring his time as vice president, Biden also had a secure facility at his house that enabled him to handle classified information. That facility was decommissioned when he left office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. James Comer (R-Ky.), who chairs the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter Friday to the White House expressing concern that Hunter Biden, the president’s son, may have had access to the garage at a time when he was engaged in foreign business dealings, and he asked for information related to the documents. The House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), is also launching an investigation and sent a letter to Garland on Friday saying it was looking into the Justice Department’s actions as it investigates the handling of classified documents.\n\nMost presidents in some way return to their former homes during their time in office. George W. Bush often spent time in Crawford, Tex., Ronald Reagan visited his ranch in California, and Donald Trump traveled to his properties in New Jersey and Florida. John F. Kennedy rarely spent weekends at the White House, often traveling to Palm Beach, Fla., Hyannis Port, Mass., or the Virginia countryside.\n\nBut for Biden, home is closer to Washington, and he is unusual among presidents in going there so often — in some cases, just for a single night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In the modern era, presidents have spent a considerable amount of time away from the White House,” said Timothy Naftali, a historian and the former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. “What I think is remarkable about how he spends his time is how he concentrates his time in one non-White House getaway.”\n\n“There’s no real downtime for a president. The presidency moves with the president,” Naftali added. “It doesn’t matter where they are. With the advent of secure videoconferencing, presidents can meet with their national security team practically anywhere.”\n\nBiden has said he never desired to live in the White House and has spoken wistfully about his time at the Naval Observatory, the comparatively secluded vice president’s residence. He does not like the cloistered feeling of the White House, the idea that security protection might prevent him from fixing his own breakfast or walking around in his bathrobe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Living in the White House, as you’ve heard other presidents who have been extremely flattered to live there, has — it’s a little like a gilded cage in terms of being able to walk outside and do things,” Biden said in a CNN town hall a month into his presidency.\n\nTwo years into his term, Biden has spent all or part of 194 days either in Wilmington or at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, according to a tally by the Associated Press.\n\nBiden’s presidency has transformed Wilmington’s leafy Greenville neighborhood, bringing security officers, barricades and armored vehicles traveling along formerly quiet roads. Still, it is not hard to feel distance from the bustle of Washington driving down the lush roads that lead to a home filled with light and family photos.\n\nBiden has long had an obsession with real estate. Earlier in his life, he had considered being an architect, and when he first married, he was eager to find a place to raise a family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’d thought about houses quite a bit already,” he wrote in his 2008 memoir “Promises to Keep.” “My idea of Saturday fun was to jump in the Corvette with Neilia and drive around the Wilmington area scouting open houses, houses for sale, land where we could build.”\n\n“Even as a kid in high school I’d been seduced by real estate,” longing for a neighborhood with tall elms and oaks, manicured lawns and interesting homes, he added.\n\nHe spent his early money moving into bigger and more stately houses and upgrading furniture, and he spent weekends on improvement. Soon his personal homes became his political war rooms. For years, his advisers gathered at a Biden home they called “The Station.”\n\nIn 1996, the Bidens sold “The Station” and purchased lakefront property on 4.2 acres for $350,000. That is where they built their current Colonial-style home with a gable roof and hardwood floors, three bedrooms and four full baths, according to local property records.\n\nThe Bidens later added a two-story cottage to the property where Biden’s mother lived. After she died in 2010, Biden rented the space to the Secret Service, earning some $172,000 over about six years, according to purchasing orders from the Secret Service.\n\nThe property is meaningful to Biden, and when he openly talked about taking out a second mortgage to help the family of his son Beau with finances, then-President Barack Obama adamantly objected.\n\n“I’ll give you the money,” Obama said, according to Biden’s 2017 book “Promise Me, Dad.” “I have it. You can pay me back whenever.”\n\nThe house has been the scene of important meetings, such as one where his grandchildren urged him to run for president. It has been the scene of trauma and angry confrontation, for example when Hunter stormed out angrily after his family staged an intervention to try to stem his drug addiction, as Hunter himself has recounted.\n\nWhen Biden’s life, like most of America’s, was altered during the spring of 2020, he retreated to his home in Wilmington. He and his wife would walk at the track next door. His grandchildren would come over and Biden would toss them ice cream bars from the porch. Geese could at times be heard honking in the background during events on Zoom.\n\nAfter a long week — one consumed with the new revelations around classified documents — Biden on Friday boarded Marine One, joined by one of his longest-serving aides and closest advisers, Steve Ricchetti, who was also his chief of staff at the end of the vice presidency. About 50 minutes later, they arrived in Wilmington, where Biden is spending most of the weekend.\n\nCarol Leonnig, Tyler Pager and Shane Harris contributed to this report.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64257918', 'Headline': 'Biden visitor logs under scrutiny after classified files found', 'Snippet': ""Congressional Republicans are demanding to see visitor logs for US President Joe Biden's homes, arguing that the discovery of classified files at one of his residences is a national security risk."", 'Full_text': 'Congressional Republicans are demanding to see visitor logs for US President Joe Biden\'s homes, arguing that the discovery of classified files at one of his residences is a national security risk.\n\nMr Biden acknowledged on Thursday that sensitive material was found in the garage of his house in Delaware.\n\nThe White House deflected when asked if the visitor logs would be provided.\n\nThe justice department has appointed an investigator to look into the files.\n\nNews that sensitive documents dating from Mr Biden\'s time as vice-president had been found in a private office at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank in Washington, emerged earlier this week.\n\nThat was followed by a disclosure that a second cache was discovered at Mr Biden\'s home.\n\nThe first batch was found on 2 November, just before the US midterm elections, but only became public on Monday.\n\nMr Biden kept an office at the think tank after he left the White House in 2017 until he launched his presidential campaign in 2019.\n\nOn Thursday, US Attorney General Merrick Garland revealed in a news conference that the second cache had been found on 20 December at Mr Biden\'s private home in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nHe added that Mr Biden\'s lawyers had called investigators on Thursday morning to notify them of an additional document, also found at the same residence.\n\nCiting the ""extraordinary circumstances"", the attorney general appointed Robert Hur, a former senior justice department official during the Trump presidency, to lead an investigation in the Biden files.\n\nKevin McCarthy, the newly elected Republican Speaker of the House, questioned the timing of the first disclosure and accused Mr Biden of knowingly mishandling the sensitive papers.\n\n""He knowingly knew [sic] this happened going into [the] election, going into interviews.

Garland appointed a special counsel on Thursday to investigate how classified documents had ended up in President Biden’s private office and home, opening a new legal threat to the White House and providing ammunition to its Republican opponents.', 'Full_text': 'The White House promised to fully cooperate while insisting prosecutors would find only unintentional errors. People close to the situation said several Biden associates had already been interviewed. But the decision to open a full investigation put both the president and the attorney general in awkward positions at the same time another special counsel appointed by Mr. Garland considers whether to charge former President Donald J. Trump or his associates with mishandling sensitive documents and obstructing efforts to retrieve them.\n\nThe circumstances in the Biden and Trump cases are markedly different. Mr. Trump resisted requests to return documents for months, even after being subpoenaed, while as far as is known, Mr. Biden’s lawyers found the papers without being asked and turned them over promptly. But as a political matter, the new investigation will muddy the case against Mr. Trump, who is already using it to argue that he is being selectively persecuted by the administration of a president he plans to challenge in 2024.\n\nMr. Biden, who excoriated Mr. Trump for being “irresponsible” with national secrets, now has to answer for his own team’s misplacement of sensitive papers. Moreover, his White House did not disclose to the public the discovery of the documents from his time as vice president for two months, waiting until after the November midterm elections, when it might have damaged Democrats.\n\nAnd as a new timetable outlined by Mr. Garland on Thursday made clear, even then the White House did not fully reveal the extent of the situation in its original statement. That statement, released on Monday, confirmed a media report about a first batch discovered at his think tank in November but made no mention of a second batch found at his Delaware home in December.\n\nOnly on Thursday, three days after that initial statement, did the White House confirm media reports about the second batch, which was discovered in the garage of Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, and a final document found nearby on Wednesday night.\n\nWhen a reporter asked Mr. Biden at an unrelated event on Thursday why classified documents were kept along with his prized Corvette, Mr. Biden replied: “My Corvette is in a locked garage. OK? So it’s not like they’re sitting out in the street.”\n\n“But as I said earlier this week,” he added, “people know I take classified documents and classified material seriously. I also said we’re cooperating fully and completely with the Justice Department’s review.”\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said the president had not been informed in advance of Mr. Garland’s decision to appoint a special counsel. She declined to clarify what initially prompted the search, how long it progressed or why the White House did not inform the public earlier.\n\nMr. Biden, she said, “was kept informed throughout,” but does not know what is in the documents. “The search is complete, he is confident in this process, and I will leave it there,” she added.\n\nBut her account of the discovery of the original batch of documents appeared at odds with the Justice Department timetable. “We did this by the book, and what I mean by that is the moment that the lawyers discovered that the papers, the documents were there, they reached out to the archives, they reached out to the Department of Justice,” she said.\n\nIn fact, according to the department, the White House informed the National Archives and Records Administration but not Justice. The department learned about the documents only when notified by the archives. A person familiar with the Biden team’s thinking, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive legal matters, said the president’s lawyers had contacted the archives with the understanding that it would inform other agencies that needed to know.\n\nOnce the Justice Department was brought in, the Biden team then dealt directly with prosecutors, including when the second batch and a final document were discovered. But it meant that the first batch was moved to the archives before the F.B.I. could examine them where they were originally found.\n\nWhile White House officials privately played down the importance of Mr. Hur’s appointment, arguing that it would matter more in Washington political circles than in the rest of the nation, special prosecutor investigations have a way of distracting and even crippling a White House, especially if they spread beyond their original scope.\n\nWith the exception of President Barack Obama, every occupant of the Oval Office since Watergate has confronted a special prosecutor scrutinizing him or members of his staff, sometimes for relatively narrow matters but at other times for issues that have mushroomed into the threat of impeachment.\n\n“An independent or special counsel investigation that touches on a White House can be significantly debilitating, especially if not isolated and managed,” said W. Neil Eggleston, who helped defend President Bill Clinton and represented a top aide to President George W. Bush during such inquiries before becoming White House counsel to Mr. Obama.\n\nIn the Clinton White House, “responding to the investigation would occupy large parts of the day of the senior staff, the White House Counsel’s Office and the communications group,” said Mr. Eggleston. “There is limited bandwidth each day, and hours taken up by responding to an investigation are lost.”\n\nThe decision to select a special counsel to look into the handling of the documents comes at an extraordinary moment for Mr. Garland, who in November tapped Jack Smith, a former war crimes and public corruption prosecutor, to lead the investigations into Mr. Trump’s mishandling of government documents as well as his actions related to the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. Hur on Thursday was intended to insulate the Justice Department from accusations of partisanship at a time when the new G.O.P. majority in the House has embarked on an aggressive and open-ended investigation into what they claim is the Biden administration’s use of government power against Republicans.\n\n“I strongly believe that the normal processes of this department can handle all investigations with integrity,” Mr. Garland told reporters. “But under the regulations, the extraordinary circumstances here require the appointment of a special counsel for this matter. This appointment underscores for the public the department’s commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters, and to making decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law.”\n\nRichard Sauber, a White House lawyer overseeing the response to investigations, said the president’s team would cooperate. “We are confident that a thorough review will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the president and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake,” he said in a statement.\n\nUnder Mr. Garland’s order, Mr. Hur is authorized to prosecute any crimes arising from the inquiry or to refer matters for prosecution by federal attorneys in other jurisdictions.\n\n“I will conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial, and dispassionate judgment,” he said in a statement. “I intend to follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly, without fear or favor, and will honor the trust placed in me to perform this service.”\n\nMr. Hur, a partner at the white-collar law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, worked as an assistant federal prosecutor in Maryland from 2007 to 2014, then served in the deputy attorney general’s office in 2017 and 2018 during the Trump administration before being appointed U.S. attorney for Maryland, a position he left when Mr. Biden took office.\n\nWhile U.S. attorney, Mr. Hur defied pressure from Mr. Trump’s Justice Department to prosecute John F. Kerry, Mr. Obama’s secretary of state, who drew Mr. Trump’s ire for arguing to preserve a nuclear agreement with Iran, according Geoffrey S. Berman, a former Trump-era U.S. attorney in Manhattan. In his memoir, “Holding the Line,” Mr. Berman wrote that after refusing to prosecute Mr. Kerry, Mr. Hur was assigned to take over the matter and ultimately declined to pursue charges as well.\n\nIn his statement on Thursday, Mr. Garland filled in some, if not all, of the gaps in the public timeline surrounding the discovery of the documents in Mr. Biden’s home and office.\n\nMr. Biden’s lawyers discovered the first batch of classified papers, said to include briefing materials on foreign governments from his time as vice president, on Nov. 2, just six days before the midterm elections, as they were closing down his office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington.\n\nThey alerted the archives, which retrieved them the next morning. Archives officials then informed the Justice Department on Nov. 4. The F.B.I. began an assessment of the situation on Nov. 9. On Nov. 14, Mr. Garland assigned John R. Lausch, the U.S. attorney in Chicago and a Trump appointee, to conduct a preliminary review to determine whether a special counsel was merited.\n\nBut the Biden team waited several weeks before coming to the conclusion, as Mr. Lausch’s review proceeded, that they should make sure there were no more surprises and conduct a search of other Biden properties. On Dec. 20, they found the second batch in Mr. Biden’s garage in Wilmington and notified Mr. Lausch. No classified papers were found at the president’s vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del.\n\nMr. Lausch, who stood next to Mr. Garland in impassive silence on Thursday, told the attorney general on Jan. 5 that a special counsel was warranted but the Chicago prosecutor declined to take the role himself because he plans to leave for the private sector early this year.\n\nFour days later, the White House issued its public statement confirming the discovery of the original batch of documents in response to a CBS News report. On Wednesday night, as they completed their search, the Biden lawyers made a third discovery as they found one more single-page classified document in a room adjacent to the garage in Wilmington and notified the Justice Department. After media reports, the White House acknowledged publicly on Thursday that Mr. Biden’s aides had found the additional documents.\n\nA person familiar with the Biden team’s thinking said lawyers did not want to announce what had happened until all the facts had been gathered. They were leery of offending Justice Department officials by going public prematurely and looking like they were litigating in the media, hoping that Mr. Lausch would conclude that no special counsel was needed.\n\nVeteran law enforcement officials, however, said the Biden team raised questions by how they had acted after finding the first set of documents in November, particularly by notifying the archives but not the Justice Department or F.B.I., which are obligated to enforce laws related to the handling of national secrets.\n\n“They created a situation in which the Justice Department was not directly involved initially,” said Timothy Flanigan, a former deputy White House counsel and Justice Department official under George W. Bush.\n\n“The documents instead were taken out of context and passed through other hands, giving the department no opportunity to review for itself what kind of security controls were around them and what other things they were stored with,” he added.\n\nChuck Rosenberg, a former senior F.B.I. official, said bringing in the bureau at the beginning would have been wiser. “It is always better for the F.B.I. to know sooner, rather than later,” he said. “These types of investigations tend not to get better with age.”\n\nReporting was contributed by Adam Goldman , Katie Benner , Jim Tankersley and Karoun Demirjian.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nJan. 12, 2023\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a former deputy White House counsel and Justice Department official.

Berman, the Trump-era U.S. attorney in Manhattan, wrote about Mr. Hur in his memoir, “Holding the Line,” which accuses the Justice Department under Mr. Trump of trying to use prosecutors in Manhattan to support Mr. Trump politically and pursue his critics. According to Mr. Berman, the Justice Department pushed his office to investigate John F. Kerry, the secretary of state in the Obama administration, who had angered Mr. Trump by trying to preserve the nuclear deal he had negotiated with Iran.\n\nAfter Mr. Berman’s office decided not to bring criminal charges against Mr. Kerry, he wrote, Attorney General William P. Barr reassigned the matter to Mr. Hur, who called Mr. Berman to ask about it. “I went through the whole thing, explained our reasons for declining, and urged Hur to do the same,” Mr. Berman wrote.\n\nMr. Hur came to “the same conclusion we did, and the Kerry investigation just quietly died — as it should have,” he added.\n\nThat was not an aberration, officials said. Mr. Hur made a point of ensuring that politics did not affect his office.\n\nAaron S.J. Zelinsky, who was one of four prosecutors to abruptly quit working on the prosecution of a longtime Trump ally, Roger J. Stone Jr., accused senior officials of intervening in the Stone case to seek a lighter sentence. When he returned to the Maryland office, Mr. Zelinsky found that Mr. Hur treated him fairly and without rancor.\n\nIn selecting Mr. Hur, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland is continuing a pattern of asking current and former Trump-appointed U.S. attorneys to handle politically sensitive investigations — like the inquiry into the president’s son, Hunter Biden — to allay any concerns about political bias.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Barr repeatedly used fellow Trump appointees to oversee politically charged investigations that arose on his watch, including a review of the Russia investigation; the prosecution of Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn; and allegations that proved to be false, that Obama officials had illegally “unmasked” Trump campaign associates in intelligence reports.\n\nMr. Garland said he decided to choose Mr. Hur after a preliminary investigation into classified documents found at a Washington think tank and Mr. Biden’s house in Wilmington, Del., prompted the appointment of a special counsel under department rules.\n\nIn November, Mr. Garland offered much the same explanation for picking Jack Smith, a veteran war crimes prosecutor, to oversee concurrent investigations into Mr. Trump’s mishandling of classified documents and his actions surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\n“This appointment underscores for the public the department’s commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters, and to making decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law,” Mr. Garland told reporters during a brief appearance on Thursday.\n\nMr. Hur promised to “conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial and dispassionate judgment,” in a statement that closely tracked Mr. Smith’s comments after he was appointed. “I intend to follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly, without fear or favor, and will honor the trust placed in me to perform this service.”\n\nMr. Hur, who has been listed as a registered Republican in Maryland, received his undergraduate degree from Harvard and graduated from Stanford Law School, where he served as executive editor of the law review.\n\nAfter serving as clerk for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and a federal appellate judge, Mr. Hur took a job as a top aide to the current F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, who was then the chief of the Justice Department’s criminal division.\n\nHe went on to work as a federal prosecutor in Maryland from 2007 to 2014, tackling a wide variety of cases. Former colleagues remember him as tough and smart — with somewhat less of a gung-ho reputation than the hard-charging Mr. Smith.\n\nIn Baltimore, Mr. Hur was known for his public corruption investigations of Democratic politicians in the city and at the Maryland State House. He brought charges against Baltimore’s former mayor, two of the city’s state legislators — all Democrats — and the city’s police chief. He also cracked down on corruption in the city’s police force and in the state’s prison system, and he won convictions against gang members and the shooter of a 3-year-old girl, a crime that rocked the city.\n\nMr. Hur often cast his prosecutions as the accountability needed to begin cleaning up the city. After his office won a conviction against Catherine E. Pugh, the former Baltimore mayor, Mr. Hur said his actions were intended to address the city’s “many pressing issues” of crime and poverty.\n\n“We need dedication and professionalism from our leaders, not fraud and corruption, if we have any hope of fixing the problems,” he said in 2019. His record of rooting out corruption by Democrats in Baltimore suggests that Republicans in Washington could be less likely to view his decisions with skepticism as he considers the case of Mr. Biden.\n\nAs U.S. attorney in Maryland, Mr. Hur also oversaw high-profile domestic terrorism investigations. His office prosecuted members of The Base, a violent white supremacist group, and a Coast Guard lieutenant named Christopher Paul Hasson who had been plotting to kill journalists, Democratic politicians, professors, Supreme Court justices and those he described as “leftists in general,” according to the Justice Department.\n\nMr. Hur worked with Thomas Windom, one of the lead prosecutors investigating the involvement of Mr. Trump and his associates in their efforts to overturn the election.\n\nOne mutual friend said they were known for their willingness to work past the point of exhaustion — and recalled the image of Mr. Hur and Mr. Windom snoring away at their desks after pulling an all-nighter when working on a case together about a decade ago.\n\nCharlie Savage and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.\n\nWhat is a special counsel?\n\nA special counsel is a semi-independent federal prosecutor.\n\nNormally, U.S. attorneys or the head of the Justice Department’s criminal division oversee criminal investigations, and they are subject to the department’s regular chain of command, which leads through other politically appointed officials to the attorney general.\n\nBut in “extraordinary circumstances,” Justice Department regulations allow the attorney general to appoint a special counsel. Such situations include when an investigation would raise the appearance of a conflict of interest for the department or when there is some other reason it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside prosecutor.\n\nHow are special counsels different from regular prosecutors?\n\nSpecial counsels have greater day-to-day autonomy than U.S. attorneys, even though they must obey Justice Department policies and remain subject to the oversight of the attorney general.\n\nThey also have protections against being arbitrarily fired: An attorney general may remove them only if they commit misconduct.\n\nWhile the attorney general has the power to overrule a special counsel’s decision to take a significant step — like indicting somebody — the regulations impose a high standard: the attorney general may do so only if he or she concludes “the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established departmental practices that it should not be pursued.”\n\nIf the attorney general does overrule a special counsel, the Justice Department must inform Congress of that decision when the investigation ends. That rule is intended to serve as a check against abuse by ensuring that lawmakers will find out.\n\nIs a special counsel the same as an independent counsel?\n\nNo. Independent counsels no longer exist.\n\nIn the late 20th century, independent counsels were periodically appointed to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by high-level officials. That included investigations into the Iran-contra scandal during the Reagan administration and into President Bill Clinton’s actions in the Whitewater land deal and his affair with Monica Lewinsky.\n\nCongress enacted the law enabling the appointment of independent counsels after the Watergate scandal, when President Richard M. Nixon ordered the dismissal of the Watergate prosecutor in what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre.\n\nUnder the law, independent counsels reported to a panel of judges and could not be fired by anyone subject to a president’s control. The Justice Department also had no say in the investigation’s budget, duration or expansion. But, while the Supreme Court upheld this arrangement, critics across the ideological spectrum eventually agreed that the law could allow prosecutors to run amok.\n\nCongress did not renew the law when it expired in 1999. Instead, the Justice Department issued internal regulations during the Clinton administration enabling special counsels to remain subject to the supervision of the attorney general.\n\nWhat are other notable special counsel investigations?\n\nThere is already an active special counsel investigating former President Donald J. Trump: Jack Smith, a longtime prosecutor who was appointed by Mr. Garland to oversee two criminal inquiries, examining Mr. Trump’s role in events leading up to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and his decision to retain sensitive government documents at his home in Florida.\n\nMr. Garland appointed Mr. Smith in November to take over both investigations, which were already in progress, and he appears to have kept most of their staff in place while that work continues.\n\nAt this stage, the work is largely taking place behind closed doors, involving matters like subpoenas for testimony before a grand jury. Among other things, Judge Beryl Howell of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia is weighing whether to hold representatives of Mr. Trump’s post-presidential office in contempt for defying a subpoena that they turn over all remaining documents with classification markings in his custody.\n\nIn 2017, the Justice Department appointed Robert S. Mueller III, a retired federal prosecutor and former F.B.I. director, to take over the investigation into Russian election interference and any ties to the Trump campaign.\n\nThe F.B.I. began that investigation in July 2016, and Mr. Mueller pursued it — along with a related inquiry into whether Mr. Trump had illegally obstructed the investigation — for about two more years. In 2019, he delivered a final report that detailed many links between the Kremlin and associates of Mr. Trump but did not charge any Trump associate with a criminal conspiracy with Russia.\n\nAfter Mr. Mueller finished his work, the attorney general at the time, William P. Barr, assigned a U.S. attorney for Connecticut, John H. Durham, to investigate the origins of the Russian inquiry. In October 2020, Mr. Barr bestowed special counsel status on Mr. Durham, entrenching him to continue his work under the Biden administration.\n\nMr. Barr’s frequent public pronouncements about the investigation helped stoke expectations among Mr. Trump’s supporters that Mr. Durham would prosecute high-level F.B.I. or intelligence officials for a “deep state” conspiracy against Mr. Trump.\n\nBut Mr. Durham did not bring any such cases. Instead, he developed two narrow cases involving charges of false statements related to outside efforts to investigate Mr. Trump and Russia. He also used court filings to insinuate that he believed the Hillary Clinton campaign and other Democrats had conspired to frame Mr. Trump for collusion, even though he did not charge such a conspiracy.\n\nBoth defendants were acquitted. Mr. Durham is now apparently writing a report for Mr. Garland about his work.\n\nMr. Hur, who also served as a top department official in the deputy attorney general’s office in 2017 and 2018, is authorized to prosecute any crimes arising from the inquiry or to refer matters for prosecution by federal attorneys in other jurisdictions, the order said.\n\nThe decision to select a special counsel to look into the handling of the documents, which include briefing materials on foreign countries, comes at an extraordinary moment for Mr. Garland, who in November tapped Jack Smith, a former war crimes and public corruption, prosecutor, to lead the investigations into former President Donald J. Trump’s mishandling of government documents and his actions related to the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nA senior department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the decision by Mr. Garland “was not taken lightly” but was required under department regulations as “a textbook example” of an investigation that necessitated a special counsel.\n\nThe appointment is intended to insulate the Justice Department from accusations of partisanship at a time when the new Republican majority in the House has embarked on an aggressive and open-ended investigation into what they claim is the Biden administration’s bias against their party.\n\nMr. Garland also filled in some, if not all, of the gaps in the public timeline surrounding the discovery of both document caches.\n\nMr. Biden’s lawyers alerted the National Archives of the classified documents at the Washington office on Nov. 2, and archives officials referred the matter to the Justice Department two days later.\n\nOn Dec. 20, the Biden team alerted the Justice Department that they found more sensitive material, Mr. Garland said. A Biden lawyer also informed the department that they had recovered one additional document hours before Mr. Hur’s appointment, he said.\n\nThe White House said the Biden team notified the department immediately when it discovered documents and arranged for the government to take possession of them.\n\nThe process for selecting a special counsel began days after the archives contacted Mr. Garland’s staff. On Nov. 14, the attorney general selected John R. Lausch Jr., the U.S. attorney in Chicago, to conduct a preliminary assessment of the material to determine whether a counsel was needed.\n\nMr. Lausch, who stood next to Mr. Garland in impassive silence on Thursday, told Mr. Garland on Jan. 5 that a special counsel was warranted.\n\nMr. Hur, who is a partner at the white-collar law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher was appointed by Mr. Trump as the U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland in 2018 and left that position at the end of the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House has acknowledged twice this week that Mr. Biden’s team had found batches of classified papers in two locations associated with him: in his former office at a think tank in Washington and in the garage of his home in Wilmington, Del.\n\nA batch of classified papers, which is said to have included briefing materials on foreign governments from Mr. Biden’s time as vice president, were found in November as lawyers were closing down his office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington.\n\nThey alerted the National Archives, which retrieved them the next morning. Archives officials then informed the Justice Department. Mr. Garland assigned the preliminary phase of the inquiry to Mr. Lausch, the U.S. attorney in Chicago and a Trump appointee, to blunt criticism that he was seeking to protect the Democratic president who appointed him.\n\nLike Mr. Lausch, Mr. Hur was a political appointee of Mr. Trump. During the Trump administration, he was the top aide to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who was also a former U.S. attorney in Maryland.\n\nBut Mr. Hur had a significant career in an apolitical role as an assistant federal prosecutor in that office from 2007 to 2014. He then worked as a trial lawyer in private practice before returning to the Justice Department to assist Mr. Rosenstein.\n\nAccording to a biography, Mr. Hur’s prosecutorial career included cases involving gang violence, gun offenses and drug trafficking, as well as white-collar crimes like fraud, public corruption, tax offenses, hacking and intellectual property theft.\n\nHe also prosecuted high-profile domestic terrorism cases.\n\nMr. Hur graduated from Harvard College and Stanford Law School and clerked for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the biography said. He worked as an aide to Christopher A. Wray, now the F.B.I. director, when Mr. Wray ran the Justice Department’s criminal division in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nGeoffrey S. Berman, the former Trump-era U.S. attorney in Manhattan, wrote about Mr. Hur in his memoir, “Holding the Line,” which accuses the Justice Department under Mr. Trump of trying to use prosecutors in Manhattan to support Mr. Trump politically and pursue his critics.\n\nAccording to Mr. Berman, the Justice Department pushed his office to investigate John Kerry, the secretary of state in the Obama administration, who had angered Mr. Trump by trying to preserve the nuclear deal he had negotiated with Iran.\n\nAfter Mr. Berman’s office decided not to bring criminal charges against Mr. Kerry, he wrote, Attorney General William P. Barr reassigned the matter to Mr. Hur, who called Mr. Berman to ask about it.\n\n“I went through the whole thing, explained our reasons for declining, and urged Hur to do the same,” Mr. Berman wrote. “Hur would come to the same conclusion we did, and the Kerry investigation just quietly died — as it should have.”\n\nThe White House waited until this month to publicly acknowledge the discovery of the documents at Mr. Biden’s former office, in response to a CBS News report revealing what had happened.\n\nThe White House acknowledged on Thursday that Mr. Biden’s aides had found a second set of classified documents, this time in a storage space in the garage of his home in Wilmington.\n\nThis is the second special counsel that Mr. Garland has appointed since taking over the top spot at the Justice Department. In November, days after Mr. Biden’s lawyers found the classified documents, the attorney general appointed Mr. Smith.\n\nMr. Smith is now running a team of prosecutors and F.B.I. agents to look into whether Mr. Trump broke any laws related to his resistance to allowing the government to retrieve thousands of official records — including several hundred marked as classified — from his Florida club and residence, even after being subpoenaed for them, including whether he obstructed that effort.\n\nSeparately, Mr. Smith is investigating whether “any person or entity” interfered with the transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHow are the situations similar?\n\nAt a basic level, both involve official files bearing classification markings that improperly accompanied Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden after they left office. Under the Presidential Records Act, White House records are supposed to go to the National Archives and Records Administration once an administration departs. Private citizens generally lack authorization to hold classified documents, and regulations require such files to be stored securely.\n\nSpecial counsels — a type of prosecutor appointed to run sensitive investigations with some independence from day-to-day Justice Department control — are now scrutinizing both situations. In Mr. Trump’s case, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, in November. On Thursday, Mr. Garland named Robert K. Hur, a former Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, as special counsel for the Biden investigation.\n\nHow are the situations different?\n\nThere are key gaps in the public record about both, but the available information suggests there were significant differences in how the documents came to light, their volume and — most important — how Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden responded.\n\nMr. Trump and his aides resisted the government’s repeated efforts to retrieve them all. Mr. Biden’s lawyers reported the problem, and the White House says it has fully cooperated.\n\nThese apparent differences have significant legal implications.\n\nWhere were the files?\n\nIn Mr. Trump’s case, several hundred government files marked as classified — along with thousands of unclassified documents and photos — ended up at his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago, after he left office. Some were in cartons in a locked storage closet, and the F.B.I. discovered others in Mr. Trump’s office, including in his desk, according to court filings.\n\nIn Mr. Biden’s case, what the administration has described as “a small number of documents with classified markings” were found in a locked closet in an office at a Washington think tank, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Mr. Biden had periodically used the space after leaving the vice presidency in 2017 and before he began his presidential campaign.\n\nA subsequent search of Mr. Biden’s house in Wilmington, Del., turned up another batch in what the White House said was a storage space in the garage, as well as a one-page document “among stored materials in an adjacent room.”\n\nHow did the files get there?\n\nAs president, Mr. Trump is said to have periodically taken records from the Oval Office to the residential areas of the White House. During the chaos of his last days in office after he sought to cling to power, those files were apparently packed up with personal items like clothing and mementos and shipped to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIt is not yet publicly known how records from the Obama administration wound up at the Penn Biden Center and Mr. Biden’s house, but the White House has suggested that boxes of files may have been shipped to both locations “in the course of the 2017 transition.” (It has also said, however, that Mr. Biden only began using the think tank office in “mid-2017.”)\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Biden said that he took classified information seriously and that he was “surprised to learn that there were any government records there that were taken to that office.”\n\nHow did the problems come to light?\n\nVery differently.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Trump, the National Archives realized in the spring of 2021 that historically prominent files were missing and asked Mr. Trump to return them. The agency eventually retrieved 15 boxes and found that they included documents with classification markings. The Justice Department retrieved additional records after issuing a subpoena.\n\nWhile a representative for Mr. Trump falsely told the department in June that they had fully complied with the subpoena, law enforcement officials obtained evidence that Mr. Trump still had more, and a court authorized an F.B.I. search in August to retrieve them.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Biden, the White House has said that his lawyers discovered the files on Nov. 2 when they were packing up to vacate the office at the Penn Biden Center. “The documents were not the subject of any previous request or inquiry by the archives,” it said.\n\nMr. Biden’s team subsequently searched two other places where the White House has said materials from his vice-presidential office might have been shipped after the Obama administration departed: his home in Wilmington and another in Rehoboth Beach, Del. No documents were found in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe White House acknowledged that Mr. Biden’s team had found the files stored at the Wilmington house and said it had reported the discovery “immediately,” but did not say when that was. In announcing his appointment of Mr. Hur, Mr. Garland said that Mr. Biden’s team had reported finding most of the documents on Dec. 20, and reported finding an additional one on the morning of Jan. 12.\n\nHow did they respond?\n\nVery differently.\n\nMr. Biden’s team reported the problem to the National Archives on the same day the first batch was discovered, and the agency retrieved the materials the next morning, the administration said. It emphasized that Mr. Biden’s team had since cooperated with the archives and the Justice Department, including by searching his two houses, “to ensure that any Obama-Biden administration records are appropriately in the possession of the archives.”\n\nMr. Biden said on Tuesday that his lawyers had acted appropriately: They immediately called the archives to turn over the materials. “We’re cooperating fully — cooperating fully — with the review, which I hope will be completed soon,” he said.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Trump and his aides delayed responding to the National Archives’ repeated requests for months, then failed to fully comply with the subpoena while falsely saying they had. A court filing also suggested that security camera footage showed that “government records were likely concealed and removed” from the storage room at Mar-a-Lago after the subpoena.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly attacked the National Archives for telling the Justice Department about the matter and portrayed the investigation as illegitimate. A federal judge is considering holding his team in contempt for defying the subpoena.\n\nIn each case, were the documents still classified?\n\nProbably.\n\nMr. Trump publicly claimed that before leaving office, he declassified everything that turned up at Mar-a-Lago. No credible evidence has emerged to support that claim, and his lawyers have resisted repeating it in court, where there are professional consequences for lying. (Moreover, the potential crimes cited in the affidavit used to search Mr. Trump’s Florida residence do not depend on whether mishandled documents were classified.)\n\nWhile the executive order governing the classified information system gives vice presidents the same power to declassify secrets as presidents wield, Mr. Biden has not claimed he declassified the materials found in the Penn Biden Center closet. He said on Tuesday that he did not know what they were.\n\nHow many classified documents were there?\n\nMany more classified documents appear to have been improperly stored at Mr. Trump’s estate than at Mr. Biden’s office.\n\nCourt filings say that 184 documents marked as classified were in the 15 boxes the National Archives initially retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. The Trump team turned over 38 more such records after the subpoena, and the F.B.I. found another 103 in its search.\n\nThe Biden administration’s initial statement said a “small number” of documents marked as classified had been discovered in the closet at the Penn Biden Center. CBS News has reported there were about 10. The administration’s statement on Thursday about the second batch found at his house in Wilmington similarly described it as “a small number.”\n\nWere documents also mutilated or destroyed?\n\nMr. Trump appears to have destroyed official documents. Former aides have said he ripped up files while in office, and a letter from the National Archives indicated that some of the files it retrieved had been mutilated.\n\nThere has been no allegation that Mr. Biden destroyed public records.\n\nWhat are the legal consequences of these differences?\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant, though more information could still come to light.\n\nOne question is whether any mishandling of secrets was intentional. A provision of the Espionage Act, for example, makes it a crime if someone, without authorization, willfully retains a national security secret “and fails to deliver it on demand” to an official entitled to take custody of it.\n\nAnother provision of the act says that a person can be guilty if, through “gross negligence,” he or she permits national security papers to be removed from their proper place of custody.

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

""Contrary to Pfizer’s public statements, however, the pandemic did not end; it got worse"" in 2021, the complaint reads.\n\n""We are pursuing justice for the people of Texas, many of whom were coerced by tyrannical vaccine mandates to take a defective product sold by lies,"" Paxton said in a press release. ""The facts are clear. Pfizer did not tell the truth about their COVID-19 vaccines.""\n\nIn all, Paxton\'s 54-page complaint acts as a compendium of pandemic-era anti-vaccine misinformation and tropes while making a slew of unsupported claims. But, central to the Lone Star State\'s shaky legal argument is one that centers on the standard math Pfizer used to assess the effectiveness of its vaccine: a calculation of relative risk reduction.\n\nThis argument is as unoriginal as it is incorrect. Anti-vaccine advocates have championed this flawed math-based theory since the height of the pandemic. Actual experts have roundly debunked it many times. Still, it appears in all its absurd glory in Paxton\'s lawsuit last week, which seeks $10 million in reparations.\n\nMath argument\n\nBriefly, the lawsuit and the anti-vaccine rhetoric before it argues that Pfizer should have presented its vaccine\'s effectiveness in terms of absolute risk reduction rather than relative risk reduction. Doing so would have made the highly effective COVID-19 vaccine appear extremely ineffective. Based on relative risk reduction in a two-month trial, Pfizer\'s vaccine appeared 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19—as Pfizer advertised. Using the same trial data but calculating absolute risk reduction, however, the vaccine effectiveness would have been 0.85 percent.\n\nThe difference between the two calculations is quite simple: Absolute risk reduction is a matter of subtraction—the percentage point drop in risk of a disease between an untreated and treated group. So, for example, if a group of untreated people have a 60 percent risk of developing a disease, but, when treated, the risk drops to 10 percent, the absolute risk reduction is 50 percent (60 – 10 = 50).\n\nRelative risk reduction involves division—the percent change difference between the two groups\' risks. So, as in the previous example, if a treatment lowers disease risk from 60 percent to 10 percent, the relative risk reduction is 83 percent (50 percent drop / 60 percent initial risk = ~0.83).\n\nBoth numbers can be helpful when weighing the risks and benefits of treatments, but absolute risk reduction is particularly key when there\'s a low risk of a disease. This can be easily understood by simply moving the decimal in the above example. If a treatment lowers a person\'s disease risk from 6 percent to 1 percent, the relative risk reduction is still 83 percent—an impressive number that might argue for treatment—but the absolute risk reduction is a paltry 5 percent—which could easily be negated by any potential side effects or high costs.\n\nCalculation context\n\nSimilar calculations were seen in Pfizer\'s trial: Of 17,411 vaccinated people, eight developed COVID-19 during the trial (0.045 percent), while 162 of 17,511 people in the placebo group developed the infection (0.9 percent). The relative risk reduction is 95 percent, while the absolute risk reduction is a decidedly unimpressive 0.85 percent.\n\nFor this reason, anti-vaccine advocates have seized upon absolute risk calculations as a way to downplay the effectiveness of lifesaving vaccines. But this steamrolls over the reason relative risk is used to examine vaccine effectiveness against infectious disease. Absolute risk is most helpful when it\'s relatively stable and can be confidently calculated, such as calculating the risk of cardiovascular disease in a person, given their blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In these cases, absolute risk reduction is very helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment. But using absolute risk for infectious diseases is often simply nonsensical because absolute risk can vary dramatically by space, time, and many other factors.\n\nFor instance, a person\'s absolute risk of flu drops significantly when it\'s not flu season. Or, if a person hops on a plane, traveling from an area with no endemic malaria directly into an area with a raging malaria outbreak, their absolute risk of infection will skyrocket when they land. And, of course, if people are under lockdowns or health restrictions—as was the case early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Pfizer\'s vaccine trials were running—their absolute risk can rise significantly when those lockdowns and restrictions are lifted—as was the case in 2021 after the vaccine\'s release.\n\nWith absolute risk so variable, relative risk is a more helpful measure of a vaccine\'s effectiveness—and the relative risk reduction applies regardless of what a person\'s absolute risk is at a given point in time.\n\nArtificial numbers\n\nAnother key reason it\'s safe to ignore absolute risk reduction in vaccine trial data is that it is often entirely artificial. These trials are designed to enroll large numbers of people with the full knowledge that only a small percentage will be exposed during the trial. And they\'re designed with trigger points—in other words, when the trial hits a pre-determined number of infections, effectiveness is calculated.\n\nIn Pfizer\'s trial, the trigger point was at or around 170. But, if the trial runners had set the trigger point somewhere else, the absolute risk reduction could easily have been different, even if everything else was the same. For instance, if it was set to 510 and there were 24 cases in the vaccine groups (0.13 percent) and 486 cases in the placebo group (2.8 percent), the relative risk reduction would still be 95 percent, but the absolute risk reduction would be 2.67 percent, not 0.85 percent.\n\nIf Pfizer had waited for all 35,000 or so people in the trial to be exposed to COVID-19 amid widespread lockdowns, it would have needlessly delayed the evaluation and release of the vaccines.\n\nAn analysis from last year estimated that COVID-19 vaccines prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and more than 3 million deaths in the first two years after their release.\n\nIn a statement to Stat, Pfizer noted the benefits and safety of its vaccine, saying that its representations of its vaccine ""have been accurate and science-based. [Pfizer] believes that the state’s case has no merit and will respond to the petition in court in due course.""'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/oct/13/instagram-posts/alleged-revelation-about-pfizer-vaccine-trial-noth/', 'Headline': 'Alleged revelation about Pfizer vaccine trial is nothing new', 'Snippet': 'Clarification: This story was updated Oct. 17 to make clear the Pfizer vaccine trial studied whether the vaccine prevented symptomatic and severe COVID-19, not infection.

Roos asked.\n\nAfter two other Parliament members asked questions, Small responded to Roos\' query.\n\n""Regarding the question around, did we know about stopping immunization before it entered the market … no,"" said Small, presumably meaning to say ""transmission"" and not ""immunization.""

He also appeared on Fox News on Oct. 11, discussing the exchange with host Tucker Carlson.\n\nBut Pfizer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and news reports before the vaccine’s approval were clear that while the vaccine was effective in preventing symptomatic and severe disease, there was no data about whether it stopped transmission to others.\n\nSome may have been surprised at Small’s answer, given public officials’ comments about vaccines and transmission. Both Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have said that vaccination can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe CDC in May 2021 changed its guidance on masking, with Fauci saying on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" that vaccinated people’s chances of transmitting the virus to others was low. The agency reversed course on that guidance two months later, when it became clear that wasn’t the case with the delta variant.\n\nBut the notion that Pfizer ""admitted"" it didn’t test its vaccine for its ability to stop transmission is incorrect.\n\nAndrew Widger, a spokesperson for Pfizer, said in a statement that details of its phase 3 clinical trial have been online since 2020, and that the trial was never intended to study transmission.\n\nThe phase 3 clinical trial was ""designed and powered"" to evaluate the COVID-19 vaccine’s efficacy in preventing disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease, Widger said. ""Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,"" he said, which means it wasn’t an outcome being studied.\n\nThe FDA, meanwhile, said in its Dec. 11, 2020, announcement of emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s vaccine that there wasn’t yet ""evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person."" A Pfizer press release that same day and another announcing its approval in the European Union on Dec. 21, 2020, made no mention of the vaccine’s effect on transmission.\n\nDr. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said the outcomes being measured in the original vaccine trials for Pfizer and Moderna were always about their effectiveness against ""symptomatic COVID-19.""\n\n""So, the prevention of transmission (and asymptomatic COVID) were not primary endpoints of these trials and were never a claim of the pharmaceutical companies in developing these vaccines,"" Gandhi said, adding, ""Indeed, this revelation is not new.""\n\nTara Smith, a Kent State University epidemiology professor, agreed, saying the Pfizer executive’s statement was ""not a ‘gotcha.’"" In a December 2020 article for the online website SELF, Smith wrote that the vaccine’s ability to stop transmission was an unanswered question, noting that it’s common in initial vaccine trials for that topic to be addressed in later studies.\n\n""We were hopeful in spring/early summer 2021 that vaccines would be effective against transmission. Delta did change that a bit, making it clear that while vaccines did, and still do, help to reduce one’s risk of infection, they alone are not enough to stop transmission,"" Smith said in an email to PolitiFact. ""That’s why many of us were and remain frustrated at CDC’s messaging around masks, suggesting the vaccinated could stop masking.""\n\nBefore the delta and omicron variants came along, studies suggested that the vaccines were somewhat effective in slowing transmission of the coronavirus.\n\n""In the era before omicron, and to some extent the delta variant, the vaccines clearly were transmission-halting to a high degree,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nOnce variants began evading vaccine immunity and breakthrough infections became more common, he added, vaccines were less likely to stop transmission.\n\nWhen Walensky ""said that vaccines decrease transmission and therefore, getting vaccinated protected others, she was providing accurate information to the American public based on data at the time,"" said Gandhi.\n\nIt’s clear that the vaccines are not a firewall against transmission to others, despite misleading claims on two occasions by President Joe Biden that we fact-checked in 2021.\n\nCurrently, Gandhi said, a recent study during the Omicron surge showed that vaccines or prior infection each decreased transmission to others by about 20%.\n\n""The pharmaceutical companies and the CDC both were accurate in terms of their messaging and reporting on the vaccines over time in terms of their ability to reduce transmission and — currently — their incredible ability to reduce severe disease due to the generation of cellular immunity,"" Gandhi said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn Instagram post claimed that a Pfizer executive suddenly ""admitted"" that its COVID-19 vaccine had not been tested for preventing transmission before it went to market.\n\nBut this is not a revelation. Pfizer’s clinical trial was always intended to study whether the vaccine prevented recipients from getting symptomatic COVID-19 and whether it prevented severe disease.

According to the company\'s website, Ventavia ""played a significant part in [COVID-19 clinical trial] recruitment"" and ""has received recognition by Pfizer for their contribution to vaccine trials.""\n\nIt was previously reported that the whistle-blower is a former regional director who was involved in Pfizer\'s vaccine trials in Texas during the fall of 2020. She alleges ""the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer\'s pivotal phase III trial.""\n\nThe images provided to The BMJ ""showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box"" and another displayed ""vaccine packaging materials with trial participants\' identification numbers written on them left out in the open, potentially unblinding participants.""\n\nDespite informing Ventavia, the director\'s concerns went unaddressed. She then filed a complaint with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was subsequently fired the same day. The FDA did not investigate the director\'s allegations, say Godlee and Abbasi, even though the evidence ""revealed a host of poor clinical trial research practices occurring at Ventavia that could impact data integrity and patient safety.""\n\nArticle Labeled as ""Hoax,"" Without Pointing Out Errors\n\nThe BMJ hired an investigative reporter to follow up on the clinical trial claims. The findings were published in an article on November 2, 2021, after the article ""went through...the usual high level legal and editorial oversight and peer review,"" according to the journal.\n\nHowever, by November 10, the journal began receiving complaints from readers unable to share the article on social media. Others had their posts flagged with warnings, such as ""missing context...independent fact-checkers say this information could mislead people."" Administrators of various Facebook groups were notified that posts containing the article were ""partly false.""\n\nReaders were informed that Facebook contractor Lead Stories performed the article\'s ""fact check."" Lead Stories is ""an award-winning innovative fact checking and debunking website"" and ""an active part of Facebook\'s partnership with third party fact checkers"" — with the latter granting them ""access to listings of content that has been flagged as potentially false by Facebook\'s systems or its users."" The company says they ""decide independently if we want to fact check it or not.""\n\nLead Stories states that they ""can enter our fact checks into a tool provided by Facebook and Facebook then uses our data to help slow down the spread of false information on its platform."" Although the contractor is compensated, Lead Stories claims they have ""no say or influence over what we fact check or what our conclusions are.""\n\nBoth editors question the validity of the fact check performed by Lead Stories, as it failed to provide any ""assertions of fact"" as to what The BMJ got wrong. Moreover, the editors take issue with Lead Stories referring to the journal as a ""news blog"" and using the phrase ""hoax-alert"" in the URL when publishing the story on its site.\n\nThe BMJ has reached out to Lead Stories and Facebook, says the letter, but Lead Stories refuses to ""change anything about their article or actions that have led to Facebook flagging our article."" Requests for Facebook to remove the ""fact checking"" label and allow ""readers to freely share the article on [Facebook\'s] platform"" have been unfruitful.\n\nGodlee and Abbasi expressed concern that other ""high quality information provider[s] have been affected by the incompetence of Meta\'s fact checking regime."" Last month, Instagram censored Cochrane, an international provider of independent systematic medical reviews. Instagram, also owned by Meta, prohibited users from tagging Cochrane because the organization ""repeatedly posted...false content about COVID-19 or vaccines."" Cochrane refuted the allegations.\n\nWhile ""fact checking has been a staple of good journalism for decades,"" say the editors, Meta has ""apparently delegated responsibility to people incompetent in carrying out this crucial task.""

But a popular YouTube video spins a conspiracy theory that distorts legal codes to falsely claim otherwise.\n\nFull Story\n\nAll of the four COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. were tested in large, randomized controlled trials for safety and efficacy before the FDA granted them emergency use authorization and they were rolled out to the public.\n\nTwo of the vaccines are now fully approved: the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots. These are the vaccines the vast majority of vaccinated Americans have received.\n\nAs is standard in clinical trials, the volunteers in the COVID-19 vaccine trials were informed of the risks and benefits so they could decide whether to participate, or what is known as informed consent.\n\nYet a Jan. 7 YouTube video that racked up more than 300,000 views in its first three days falsely claims the trials were a sham. The video also incorrectly suggests the trial participants did not give informed consent.\n\n“A bombshell new report shows that the Department of Defense — yes the pentagon — controlled the COVID-19 program from the very beginning, and everything we were told was political theater, basically to cover it up, right down to the FDA vaccine approval process,” says host Clayton Morris, at the start of the video. “It was all theater. That means that human beings were used as props.”\n\nThe 17-minute video is an episode of the YouTube show Redacted, which Morris co-hosts with his wife and which has previously trafficked in misinformation, including about COVID-19. Morris is a former “Fox & Friends” host and real estate investor who moved to Portugal following fraud allegations by former clients.\n\nThe video features Alexandra, or Sasha, Latypova, who is described as “a former executive of a pharmaceutical contract research organization.” She has previously made media appearances with organizations opposed to vaccines, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Children’s Health Defense, and has written for the pseudoscientific website TrialSiteNews.\n\nIn the Redacted interview, Latypova makes a series of false claims, many predicated on her misreading of government contracts and the legal code. Lawyers with expertise in the area told us the claims are bunk.\n\nFalse Claim About ‘Theatrical’ Clinical Trials\n\nLatypova kicks off her interview by claiming “the Department of Defense used very shady contracting practices and also used several laws that were put in place previously … to shield pharmaceutical companies, to not conduct, you know, proper clinical trials.”\n\n“As a result, we have this theatrical performance called clinical trials, but they were actually not real,” she continues. “Based on the laws that are used here and then involved in this process, clinical trials are not required at all. And, and in fact they cannot be conducted.”\n\nThis is patently false. All of the vaccine clinical trials were very much real. Not only have thousands of Americans participated in these trials, some of whom have been interviewed for news stories, but there are reams of data from these trials that the FDA reviewed prior to issuing the emergency use authorizations and the approvals.\n\nThese data were also reviewed by multiple independent review groups for the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in publicly accessible meetings, and the results were also published in peer-reviewed journals. The notion that these trials were not real strains credulity and requires conspiratorial thinking.\n\nLatypova’s mischaracterization likely stems from her misreading of the laws governing emergency use authorizations, or EUAs. It’s true that an EUA, which can cover a variety of diagnostics, treatments or vaccines during an exceptional situation such as a pandemic, is different from a full approval — and does not necessarily require a clinical trial.\n\nHowever, the legal code specifically says that an EUA can consider data “from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if available.” And for the COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA made clear in guidance that clinical trials were required.\n\nAn October 2020 FDA guidance document states that for a COVID-19 vaccine “for which there is adequate manufacturing information to ensure its quality and consistency, issuance of an EUA would require a determination by FDA that the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its risks based on data from at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner.”\n\n“For vaccines (and new drugs like Paxlovid, which also received an EUA) the FDA always requires clinical trials,” Villanova University law professor Ana Santos Rutschman told us. “Technically, guidance is not binding,” she added, “but we’ve never seen FDA depart significantly from guidance it issues in any of these areas.”\n\nAnd of course, trials were indeed performed for all of the vaccines that received an EUA, contrary to Latypova’s claim that they were fake.\n\n“The difference between an EUA and other forms of regulation is that the standard for effectiveness is that ‘it is reasonable to believe’ that a product is effective,” Rutschman explained. “‘Reasonable to believe’ is a lower standard than the one required for full approval; this means that companies are able to submit clinical trial data to the FDA sooner than they normally would under the full approval pathway. But the clinical trials still have to be ok’ed by the FDA, which also reviews all the data generated during the trials, and keeps monitoring the product even after it is authorized under an EUA, as well as after full approval.”\n\n“Sasha Latypova’s argument is a classic example of a causal fallacy,” Jacob S. Sherkow, a law professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told us. “Latypova assumes that because some clinical investigations are not required under an EUA, they could not have occurred.”\n\n“It’s bogus as a matter of law, as a matter [of] logic, and a matter of fact,” he added.\n\nFalse Informed Consent Claim\n\nAnother of Latypova’s false claims is the suggestion that informed consent wasn’t obtained in the COVID-19 vaccine trials.\n\nShe cites the 21st Century Cures Act signed in 2016 by President Barack Obama, saying the law changed “the informed consent requirements, such that subjects don’t have to be necessarily informed of what’s going on if it’s deemed not in their best interest.”\n\nLatypova proceeds to suggest that this is what happened in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. “They don’t have to inform the subjects what it is, they can use a lot of secrecy, they don’t have to run clinical trials, they’re not required, because these products cannot be investigational products, that’s what the law says,” she says, repeating her claim about the trials. “If they cannot be investigational products, then we don’t have any investigation, we don’t have any clinical trial subjects. So that’s how they’re pulling this off.”\n\n“[I]t’s just nonsense,” Sherkow said. “There’s nothing in the CURES Act that says, ‘No informed consent for clinical trials.’”\n\nRutschman agreed, noting that the Cures Act allows for small modifications to informed consent in certain situations, but does not “do away with informed consent requirements.”\n\nOther scientists have published research analyzing the informed consent documents used in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. While the researchers concluded the forms should have been shorter and easier to read, it’s simply not true that such forms did not exist.\n\nLatypova’s related legal claim about “investigational products” refers to a particular part of the legal code about EUAs (21 U.S. Code § 360bbb–3(k)) that states the use of an EUA product “shall not be considered to constitute a clinical investigation.” But Rutschman said Latypova’s interpretation of those words is “entirely incorrect.”\n\nRather than meaning that an EUA product cannot be studied in a clinical trial, as Latypova has incorrectly assumed, the law is saying that an EUA product still needs to be studied or continued to be studied in a clinical trial to receive full approval, Rutschman said.\n\n“The provision is saying this is a particular pathway to bring products to market during an emergency, but use of these products is not a clinical investigation; if you’re going to seek full approval you have to continue running trials even as you make the vaccines/drugs available under an EUA,” she explained.\n\nOther Assorted Claims\n\nAmong Latypova’s numerous other false claims (we aren’t covering them all) is the suggestion that the pandemic was “planned” and that an unnamed “they” — presumably the government — want to relinquish control to the World Health Organization.\n\n“The pre-planning goes [back] years,” Latypova says. “For example, there is pandemic enterprise. It’s a quasi-private, quasi-government enterprise that’s been set up in 2013 that involves 10 heads of federal agencies.” She calls the group a “cabal” and claims the majority of the efforts were focused on maintaining secrecy.\n\n“It’s almost like they knew this was coming,” Morris interjects. “This is where we talk about conspiracy theories on the show. I mean, it’s all true.”\n\nIt’s unclear which entity Latypova has in mind. The most likely candidate is a group known as the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise. It’s primarily made up of officials in multiple agencies, but includes industry partners, and helps to coordinate the government’s response during public health emergencies. It was created in 2006.\n\nIn any case, it’s incorrect to suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. Conspiracy theorists have made similar claims before, as we’ve written. The reality is that well before 2019, scientists and government officials had been concerned about pandemics, including those caused by coronaviruses. Trying to prepare for them is not evidence that they were orchestrated or planned.\n\nNear the end of the video, Morris suggests that “they’re already planning the next one” — presumably referring to the government and the next pandemic — and Latypova agrees.\n\n“The next important thing that they want to do is give up our sovereignty to WHO,” she says, referring to the International Health Regulations.\n\nWe’ve explained before that the WHO can make recommendations for countries to follow during global health emergencies, but the WHO doesn’t have authority over countries to force compliance.\n\nIt’s worth noting that while Latypova and Morris make much of the Department of Defense’s role in the COVID-19 vaccine program, there is nothing unusual about it.\n\n“DoD is always very involved in vaccine R&D,” Rutschman said, noting that historically, many vaccine-preventable diseases occur outside of the U.S. where American troops are often deployed. “[I]t’s totally normal for DoD to be the contracting agency; as funders, they have an interest in demanding that their funding recipients perform R&D that is compliant with FDA regs and likely to obtain authorization/approval if the resulting product is good.”\n\nAs for the claim the Department of Defense used “shady” contracting methods, Rutschman explained that the contracting mechanism, known as “other transaction authority,” or OTA, simply allows the department to purchase items or services quickly — and is hardly unprecedented.\n\n“DoD had used the OTA pathway many times before COVID-19,” she said. “This form of contracting enables the government to move faster; it is perfectly legal and well-regulated.”\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s articles correcting health misinformation are made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

[1]', 'Full_text': 'COVID-19 elimination strategy\n\n""Zero-COVID policy"" redirects here. For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/', 'Headline': ""What is China's zero-COVID policy and how does it work?"", 'Snippet': 'Nearly three years into the pandemic, China is sticking with a strict COVID-19 containment policy that has caused mounting economic damage and widespread frustration, while keeping its borders ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 4: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6182781/china-zero-covid-economic-crisis/', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-COVID Policy Is Causing An Economic Crisis - TIME', 'Snippet': 'According to a study published May 10 by researchers from Shanghai’s Fudan University, Indiana University, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, relaxing COVID-19 restrictions in China ...', 'Full_text': 'In mid-May, I traveled from London to Slovenia to interview the Ukrainian men’s soccer team on their bid to reach November’s Qatar World Cup. It was a four-day assignment, requiring travel via train stations, airports, and taxi ranks—but at no point was I asked to show a negative COVID-19 test, my vaccination status, nor even to wear a facemask. I can barely recall seeing anyone wear one, least of all the elite sportsmen with whom I mingled daily. It was equally refreshing and disconcerting—as if Europe had forgotten that the pandemic had ever happened and was indeed still happening.\n\nIt was on this trip that a news alert flashed on my phone: China, on May 14, announced it was withdrawing from hosting the Asian Football Confederation Cup—the continent’s premier international soccer tournament—due to a COVID-19 outbreak that, on that same day, was responsible for only 65,000 cases and 45 deaths nationwide. That China is still wedded to a stringent zero-COVID policy focused on stamping out every infection, rather than mitigating severe illness and deaths, wasn’t a secret to anyone following the harsh lockdown endured by the 26 million residents of Shanghai, its biggest city, over the last two months. Still, it was surprising because Beijing, not too long ago, hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics without seeding a major outbreak and China’s leadership relishes in the prestige that accompanies these major sporting events. But what caught my eye most was the timing: the nixed tournament didn’t kick off until June 2023.\n\nWhat it suggests is that China has no intention of following the West into a vaccine-powered “living with the virus” dynamic. That’s bad news for China’s own economy and for any diminishing hopes worldwide of avoiding a global recession. Over the last two decades, China has contributed a quarter of the rise in global GDP—in that time, the first quarter of 2020 was the only one when its economy did not expand. Today, however, more than 200 million Chinese live under pandemic restrictions, battering an already slowing economy. Retail sales in April were 11% lower year-on-year, while housing sales—comprising over a fifth of GDP—plummeted 47% over the same period. Unemployment across a sample of 31 major Chinese cities is now the highest per official data since records began in 2018. Scenes from early May of workers fighting with public health officials at a factory producing Apple MacBooks in Shanghai after they were refused permission to leave their workplace to rest at on-site dormitories spotlights the mounting friction between economic priorities and public health.\n\n“Ordinary Chinese people have felt the heavy-handed authoritarianism of the Party in a much more direct and personal way than many people, especially young people, have before,” says Astrid Nordin, the Lau Chair of Chinese International Relations at Kings College London.\n\nRead more: China, Isolated From the World, Is Now the Last Major Country Still Pursuing a ‘Zero COVID’ Strategy\n\nSince China began market reforms in the late 1970s, its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has rooted its legitimacy in improving livelihoods. But over the last two years, President Xi Jinping has seized on China’s success conquering the virus as proof of the superiority of its political system over the West. These two success stories are now in direct conflict. On May 25, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang held an emergency meeting with over 100,000 party members where he warned China’s current economic woes were in some ways greater than the initial impact of the pandemic in 2020 and indicated that the annual growth target of 5.5% was unobtainable.\n\n“The economic crisis owing to draconian measures to control the outbreak really shows the mess, miscoordination, and miscalculations by leadership at the top,” says Valarie Tan, an analyst on Chinese elite politics for the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. “We’re finally seeing the full manifestation of this ideological turn by Xi Jinping.”\n\nStill, nobody expects Beijing to abandon its zero-COVID policy anytime soon. It’s especially sensitive for Xi as the 20th CCP Congress approaches in the fall, when the strongman is expected to assume a third five-year presidential term, ripping up the longstanding convention that leaders only serve two. The prospect of COVID-19 running amok while he takes this historic step won’t be countenanced. On May 5, the CCP’s Politburo’s standing committee, China’s apex political body, said zero-COVID was “determined by the nature and purpose of the Party,” thus expressly linking it with CCP legitimacy, while declaring that relaxing controls would lead to “massive numbers of infections, critical cases and deaths.”\n\nDespite the ideological nature of China’s zero-COVID obsession, this grim prognosis is not hyperbole. According to a study published May 10 by researchers from Shanghai’s Fudan University, Indiana University, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, relaxing COVID-19 restrictions in China could lead to 112 million cases and 1.5 million deaths in just three months. This is above all because China has not fully vaccinated 100 million of its 264 million citizens over 60, or 38%. In semi-autonomous Hong Kong, a wave of the highly transmissible Omicron variant led to some of the world’s worst daily mortality rates in recent months, with 95% of those deaths in over-60s who hadn’t been fully vaccinated.\n\nRead more: How Hong Kong Became China’s Biggest COVID-19 Problem\n\nIn this regard, China is a victim both of its success in stemming the spread of less transmissible variants and of its backslapping propaganda. Elderly people with scant desire to travel abroad saw no need to get vaccinated against a virus that the state had triumphantly declared vanquished. Meanwhile, owing to a pernicious blend of national security and national pride, China has not approved any foreign vaccines, meaning it doesn’t have access to the most effective types, which are those based on mRNA technology. Homegrown alternatives have spotty efficacy.\n\nNot that it really matters in a place where zero-COVID is the iron-clad law of the land. Even the best COVID-19 vaccines do not eliminate transmission, but they do slow the spread and drastically reduce the severity of symptoms. However, that renders them incompatible with any zero-COVID strategy, which doesn’t differentiate between mild or severe cases, or those in young and old. The policy targets infections, period, not sickness or deaths. “This is why it’s so political,” says Dr. Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the New York City–based Council on Foreign Relations. “Unless they abandon their zero-COVID mindset there’s really no way out of this.” Little wonder even the WHO says that zero-COVID is unsustainable.\n\nThe Chinese public are wising up to this fact and complaints about the government’s handling of the pandemic have become common even on the nation’s heavily censored social media. This has led to a new official edict: jingmo, or silence. Stop grumbling, in other words. During that May 5 Politburo standing committee meeting, Xi vowed to crack down on “all words and deeds that distort, doubt, and deny our epidemic prevention policies.” Ominously, China’s National Health Commission chief Ma Xiaowei wrote in CCP ideological journal Qiushi on May 16 that more “permanent” quarantine hospitals must be built and weekly testing “normalized.”\n\nNot hosting the AFC Cup won’t do much damage to China’s global reputation. But rolling lockdowns, which are sending China’s factories screeching to a halt, with cascading detrimental effects all the way down global supply chains, will make commercial partners look elsewhere. In Shanghai, China’s biggest port responsible for one-fifth of the country’s international shipping, average waiting time for import containers was 12.9 days on May 12, up from 7.4 days compared to six weeks earlier, according to shipment tracker Project 44. Over half of American businesses in China either delayed or decreased investments in China due to lockdown measures, according to a recent survey by the local U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThanks to current measures, “China might be seen as a less reliable trading partner than previously,” says Nordin, of Kings College. “The question is how much less reliable than other possible alternatives?”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00059-023-05183-5', 'Headline': 'The COVID-19 pandemic in China: from dynamic zero-COVID to current ...', 'Snippet': 'On 8 January 2023, after 3 years of pandemic control, China changed its management of COVID-19, applying measures against class B infectious diseases instead of Class A infectious diseases.

Each country and city may have its own unique circumstances that require additional considerations and adaptations [1]. China has a population of 1.41 billion. Due to this huge population base, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a scientific, gradual, and cautious approach. Preparations for the epidemic and changes in the external environment have created conditions for the reopening [2], including the evolvement of the external environment, gradual formation of the COVID-19 immune barrier, the increased awareness of virus prevention, the advancement in COVID-19 treatment, lower virulence of the Omicron variant [3], and the decreased severe COVID-19 rate and mortality rate [4].\n\nExpansion of healthcare capacity\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the reopening policy, mainly in the following aspects: First, to prepare for potential risks of medical resource overloading associated with the reopening, in the past 3 years, the National Health Commission of China has taken measures to expand healthcare capacity and make progress in treating COVID-19. Common fever clinics have been opened and critical care beds have been expanded to alleviate medical overloading. Medical institutions across the country have strengthened their respiratory infectious disease prevention and control capabilities, with increased medical beds and equipment, as well as improved medical rescue abilities. Moreover, China’s medical grading diagnosis and treatment system plays an important role in meeting the needs of patients and effectively operating the primary medical system. Antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been included in medical insurance through fast-approval channels, and maximum efforts are being made to provide drugs to patients in need. The government and health departments at all levels are providing human, financial, and material support to primary medical institutions to help establish an effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment mode.\n\nDuring the reopening period, China focused on enhancing the ability to treat severe COVID-19 cases, improving the efficiency of transferring severe cases, and preventing mild cases from becoming severe. The collective efforts of the public governance system helped to meet medical needs and navigate the peak of infections.\n\nVaccination program\n\nSecond, SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China [5]. With the widespread promotion and the national free vaccination policy, by early November 2022, over 90% of the total population had completed the full course of the new coronavirus vaccine. Research conducted by the National Major Scientific and Technological Infrastructure for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center showed that among infected individuals aged 60 or older who received two to three doses of the inactivated coronavirus vaccine, the rate of severe illness protection reached 90.15% [6]. The rate of severe illness protection for all infected individuals was reported to be 96.02%. Data released by a research team from the University of Hong Kong also supported the efficacy of domestically produced inactivated vaccines in preventing severe illness and death [7].\n\nEpidemic prevention and control mechanism\n\nThird, over the past 3 years, China has improved its epidemic prevention and control mechanism for COVID-19. The “State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism” was established as a multidepartment coordination platform to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. Through this mechanism, many local outbreaks have been successfully controlled, and guidelines have been developed by the National Health Commission and experts in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, medical treatment, and public health policy. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infection” has been updated ten times to provide up-to-date strategies and recommendations.\n\nWeakened viral virulence\n\nLast but not the least, the variant of SARS-CoV‑2 is accompanied by variable characteristics of the clinical picture, with disease severity appearing to be lower with the Omicron variant [8]. Some scientists warned that this does not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed less virulence than previous variants of concern and lung function was less compromised [9]. There is growing evidence to suggest that, with the protection of vaccines and improved treatment conditions, the harm of COVID-19 to the population has significantly decreased over time [10].\n\nThese are just some of the prerequisites for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus is highly contagious, and the short-term surge in confirmed cases is an undoubtful challenge faced by medical institutions after the reopening. The 3‑year period of hard and effective epidemic prevention and control in China has won valuable time and experience for the comprehensive opening up of the country. It seems that the threat of the virus to the population has become more manageable; thus, ending the dynamic zero-COVID policy and reopening the country supports economic recovery and international cooperation. In 2022, Omicron became the dominant strain in China, with a weakened pathogenicity resulting in mostly mild symptoms and a small proportion of severe cases. With high vaccination rates and effective epidemic control measures, the focus shifted from “dynamic clearance” to “protecting vulnerable populations.” On January 7, 2023, the State Council issued the 10th edition of the prevention and control plan, which emphasized vaccination and personal protection, optimized testing strategies, and outlined emergency measures during the epidemic.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25433800-100-zero-covid-strategies-are-being-ditched-but-they-were-the-best-option/', 'Headline': 'Zero-covid strategies are being ditched, but they were the best option', 'Snippet': 'Countries that followed the zero-covid playbook have done better on every measure, from death rates to economic growth.

One of the biggest shifts has been the abandonment of the “zero covid” strategy by countries like New Zealand and Vietnam, which are opening up and allowing the virus to spread.\n\nAs a result, it is tempting to think the approach was a mistake and that the strategy of nations like the UK has won out. But that is nonsense. Countries that followed the zero-covid playbook have done better on every measure, from death rates to economic growth. If more nations had implemented this approach, humanity would be in a better place. When the next pandemic emerges, governments should consider trying to eliminate it using zero-covid methods.\n\nThere is no single definition of a zero-covid strategy, but it generally means reducing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus as much as possible. This typically entails a rapid lockdown once the virus is detected in the community, followed by reopening once cases have fallen, combined with a robust system for testing, tracing chains of infection and supporting those who need to self-isolate.\n\nThe most obvious benefit is that far fewer people die. As of 18 March, New Zealand had seen 151 confirmed deaths from covid-19, or 0.003 per cent of its population – even though the virus repeatedly snuck into the country. In contrast, more than 164,000 people are confirmed to have died in the UK, which is 0.24 per cent of the population.\n\nZero-covid policies also cause less economic harm. When the virus is barely present, people feel confident going out, so the economy can reopen more fully. There is an economic cost to the initial lockdown, but many nations that allowed the virus to spread have also had lockdowns to save their health systems and so paid the same costs – and their lockdowns were often longer. A 2021 study found there was greater economic growth in zero-covid countries than in those that let the virus spread. The one big downside is that maintaining border controls hurt trade and tourism. But overall, zero-covid nations did better economically.\n\nAlthough zero covid was a successful strategy for countries like New Zealand, they are now abandoning it. A key factor has been the evolution of the virus. The delta variant was far more transmissible than the original virus, and the newer omicron variant is more transmissible still. These new variants can only be halted by truly draconian measures, so governments that previously banked on elimination have been forced to let the virus in.\n\nIf the target of zero covid is now being ditched, does that mean it was a failure? A crude answer would be: only if you think saving lives and preserving economic growth constitutes a misstep.\n\nLet’s go further. Consider what would have happened if, in early 2020, every country able to had adopted a zero-covid policy. It is incontestable that the global death count would be far lower, fewer people would have long covid and the economic damage would have been reduced. The virus would still be spreading, but slowly, and rising rates of vaccination would control it further. Crucially, omicron probably wouldn’t have had the chance to evolve.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, governments like the UK’s asserted that eliminating the virus was utterly impractical and so it was necessary to let it pass through the population in a “controlled” manner. Two years on, we know that was wrong.\n\nWhen the next pandemic emerges – as it will – governments should remember zero covid, and work together to eliminate the new threat if they feasibly can. Coordinated international action is hard, but we must learn to do it.\n\nMichael Marshall is a science writer in Devon, UK, and author of The Genesis Quest'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.lemonde.fr/en/china/article/2023/01/02/from-zero-covid-to-rapidly-removing-restrictions-three-years-of-disruptive-health-management-in-china_6009992_162.html', 'Headline': 'From zero-Covid to rapidly removing restrictions: Three years of ...', 'Snippet': ""Covid-19 patients in the lobby of the Number 5 People's Hospital in Chongqing, China, on December 23, 2022.

The evidence of this tragic outcome can be seen both in the lines outside of Beijing\'s crematoriums and the precautionary measures currently being taken by various countries facing the risks of a new ""Chinese variant"" of Covid.\n\nWhile life has begun to return to normal in Beijing in late December, schools are still closed, pharmacies are under-stocked and hospitals are overflowing.

Dozens of hearses line up at a Beijing crematorium; bodies wrapped in orange plastic pile in hospitals; patients on ventilators are crammed on a ward floor.\n\nThe decision by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership to roll back its stringent zero-COVID policy and allow the virus to proliferate has led to a surge in cases and an immense strain on health services. It’s a quite staggering reversal. On Nov. 10, President Xi Jinping—the self-anointed “commander-in-chief” of a “people’s war” against the virus—instructed his Politburo to stick “resolutely” to “dynamic zero-COVID.” Residents of Shanghai were forcibly detained in quarantine facilities over the summer because of a single case in a neighboring housing block.\n\nRead More: China’s Zero-COVID Trap\n\nBut zero-COVID was virtually abandoned on Dec. 7, with China’s top medical adviser now comparing the Omicron variant to “flu.” On Dec. 13, a tracking app that had tyrannized every life in China for the past three years was abruptly taken offline. On Sunday, officials in the central city of Chongqing decreed that mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases could “go to work as normal.”\n\nThe screeching U-turn underlines the fickle nature of strongman rule but also the immense paranoia of the CCP when faced with public discontent, such as the protests that erupted in late November across several Chinese cities. The catalyst was the deaths of at least 10 people in an apartment block fire in China’s western city of Urumqi that observers blamed on draconian pandemic controls keeping residents locked in their homes. (Officials deny this.) It spurred a wave of protests, with scores of people gathering on streets and university campuses across the country, shouting “we want freedom, not PCR tests,” and even “down with Xi Jinping.”\n\nRead More: Detained Zero-COVID Protesters in China Share Their Stories\n\nThe sudden rollback of restrictions that followed “could be seen as a victory for people power,” says Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nStill, the policy climbdown is surprising. China’s security services were swift to track down and detain demonstrators, who were never close to forming a political opposition. “They never quite galvanized into a single, unified, politically actionable message,” says Wen-Ti Sung, a scholar specializing in Chinese elite politics at the Australian National University. But what likely spooked Xi was the breadth of discontent that zero-COVID engendered. Affluent Shanghainese, embattled students facing bleak job prospects, and migrant workers in southern factories all railed against its privations and related economic blowback in distinct but analogous acts of rebellion. Their concerns were well-founded; models suggest zero-COVID may have cost the Chinese economy $384 billion and reduced GDP growth by 2.2 percentage points.\n\nIt’s perhaps unsurprising that a CCP spawned from popular revolution should fear the wrath of the masses most of all. In truth, however, over two-thirds of the 303 autocrats ousted from power worldwide between 1946 and 2008 were unseated by elite coups, with only a small minority bested by popular uprisings. The lesson being that rather than fear a mob over the horizon, leaders like Xi should be looking over their shoulder. It’s clear that he does the latter too, of course; by assuming a protocol-breaking third leadership term in November, while stocking his inner circle with loyalists and lackeys, Xi has doggedly insulated himself from potential rivals.\n\nHerein may lie the problem. The fear was always that this new leadership’s homogeneity would undermine the quality of its policy-making. “That it has been having a hard time facing its first major test—smooth transition out of zero-COVID—has not been helpful in dispelling those concerns,” says Sung. The government saw the economic pain of zero-COVID and wanted to make adjustments. But local officials who for the past three years have been judged first and foremost on stamping out the virus were naturally hesitant. So the central leadership had to take bolder steps to force their arm such as dismantling the nationwide tracking apparatus. Cue the lurch from one extreme to another. Today, China is caught between Xi’s two festering paranoias—fear of the people, and of challenges within the party.\n\nThe consequences may be dire. With virtually no community exposure to the virus, and only low efficacy domestic vaccines, the surge in cases will no doubt result in many deaths—some models predict over 1 million—despite official denials. Zhang Wenhong, a prominent Chinese doctor often likened to America’s Dr. Anthony Fauci, has warned that China’s medical institutions will face their “darkest hour” by next month.\n\nInstead, a new propaganda campaign has taken over. Previously, pandemic chaos in the West was painted as evidence of liberal democracy’s failings. Meanwhile, China’s success in banishing the virus was proof of a superior political system. But on Dec. 12, the CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily newspaper instead framed zero-COVID as a necessary stopgap to buy time while the virus’s severity waned and effective treatments were developed. Its dismantling, so it went, was always in the works. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” it wrote.\n\nThe problems with this account are myriad and glaring. If this opening up was long-planned, then surely more efforts should have been made to vaccinate the elderly. Currently, only 42% of over-80s have had three doses of the vaccines, according to government figures. Today, people seeking boosters are being turned away from clinics due to a lack of supply. The most vulnerable could have been given more effective foreign vaccines. (On Tuesday, the U.S. offered China mRNA vaccines, though nobody expects the nationalistic CCP to accept.) In addition, effective antivirals like Paxlovid should have been stockpiled; one Chinese website sold out its supply in half-an-hour.\n\nPublic health experts also struggle with the logic of opening up some six months after most Chinese have had their last jab, given the rapidly decreasing efficacy of vaccines over time. Not to mention there’s just weeks before China’s Spring Festival—humanity’s largest annual migration, when some 200 million Chinese cram into buses and trains for long journeys to ancestral villages where medical facilities are rudimental at best.\n\n“Even healthcare workers were caught off-guard [by the reversal],” says Huang.\n\nYet the CCP’s account is already written. On Dec. 14, authorities stopped reporting infections deemed “asymptomatic,” which in China is often stringently defined as those not confirmed with a chest scan. Then, on Dec. 20, officials said that they would only include on its official COVID-19 death tally those who had tested positive for the virus and died of respiratory failure or pneumonia—excluding anyone with complicating conditions, as is frequently the case with elderly patients. The aim is to push home the message that China suffered the lowest COVID-19 toll of any major power.\n\nMany Chinese will no doubt buy the propaganda. But a large number have had their eyes opened by the bungling of zero-COVID, the lives lost to suicides and treatable ailments that worsened in an ultimately futile attempt to stamp out the virus. The protests only serve to show that the party is, in fact, fallible and responsive to public anger, that the people have more power than anyone thought. “This will be very encouraging for Chinese civil society, which has had very little space to work in for years,” says Sung. The irony is, of course, that so far they have only nudged the CCP from suffocating control to callous inaction.\n\n“I don’t know how anybody can have confidence in China anymore,” says one Shanghai resident, speaking to TIME on condition of anonymity for fear of official reprisals. “Disruption and unexpected things is one thing, but a government pulling the rug under your feet is quite another.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://english.www.gov.cn/news/topnews/202201/10/content_WS61db8e5cc6d09c94e48a3610.html', 'Headline': 'Zero-COVID policy keeps pandemic under control - State Council of the ...', 'Snippet': 'Zero-COVID policy keeps pandemic under control.

These outbreaks were caused by imported infections, according to health authorities.\n\nLiang Wannian, head of the National Health Commission\'s COVID-19 leading task force, said China adopted the ""dynamic zero-infections policy"" in August.\n\n""Under the overarching goal of preventing imported infections and domestic flare-ups, this policy means that when a new local outbreak occurs, measures will be taken to promptly stem the spread of the virus and clear new infections,"" he said.\n\n""This approach is the best option and the guiding principle of China\'s disease control work. We must resolutely adhere to the policy and protect the health and safety of the population as the top priority.""\n\nWu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the strategy of swiftly dealing with new outbreaks can protect most regions of China against the virus, ensure people live normal lives and that production can continue.\n\n""This policy has had significant results,"" he said. ""Most regions on the Chinese mainland are free of COVID-19 infections, and new cases are either detected among incoming passengers or brought in by cargo from overseas.""\n\nIn late November, Wu forecast that without these stringent measures, and as the virus rampaged across the world, China would have experienced some 47.8 million infections and 950,000 related deaths if the infection and death rates were on par with the global average.\n\nAs the Omicron variant spreads rapidly across the world, prompting many countries to reimpose border closures and travel curbs, experts said the success of China\'s policy has become even more evident.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, which is based in New York, said the Omicron variant was a ""booster shot"" for the zero-COVID policy.\n\nHe added that efforts by some Western countries to reinstate COVID-19 restrictions have undermined their claims that the approach adopted by China is not sustainable.\n\nMartin Jacques, a well-known scholar from the United Kingdom and a former senior fellow at Cambridge University\'s Department of Politics and International Studies, said on Twitter that Western nations, despite their dismal performances in dealing with the virus, are questioning the effective work performed by China.\n\n""Omicron arrives. Up go the restrictions. Panic stations. And China is sitting pretty. When will they learn－from China,"" he said in a post in late November.\n\nClaims dismissed\n\nA common misconception of China\'s virus control strategy is that it is aimed at achieving zero infections.\n\nLiang said, ""Currently, we are not capable of ensuring there will be no more new domestically transmitted infections, but we are capable and confident of stamping out local infection clusters as quickly as possible.\n\n""A dynamic zero-COVID strategy means not letting the pandemic spiral out of control, but actively controlling it. This strategy meant we had to take prompt and precise action.""\n\nLiang said the first line of defense is implementing pre-departure prevention measures targeting overseas travelers to China－placing these arrivals under ""close-loop management"" immediately they enter the country. Measures to prevent transmission via objects should also be taken.\n\nWen Xiaoqing, an official with the health commission in Tianjin, said local authorities have devised seamless procedures for handling overseas passengers.\n\n""Our measures start right after an international flight lands in Tianjin－from checking passengers\' health codes, temperatures and vaccination history, to conducting epidemiological investigation,"" he said.\n\n""People with symptoms such as fever or respiratory illnesses are transferred by special vehicles to designated hospitals, where they are isolated for further diagnosis and treatment. We also thoroughly disinfect all areas they pass through.""\n\nWu Hao, a national-level disease control expert and public health professor at Capital Medical University in Beijing, said the fact that the mainland\'s first Omicron infection was detected in a centralized isolation area is evidence of the effectiveness of the nation\'s monitoring system.\n\nLiang, from the National Health Commission, said increased surveillance measures, especially at fever clinics, along with additional nucleic acid testing capacity and constant screening for mutation, are also key to China containing the virus.\n\nIn July and August, some 10 rounds of mass testing were carried out in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province, to handle a local outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nWu Feng, head of the intensive care unit at the Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University, said during a news briefing that because the novel coronavirus has an incubation period and is transmitted ""stealthily"", it is extremely difficult to detect all infections at the same time.\n\n""As a result, even when the majority of residents test negative for the virus in earlier rounds of mass testing, it is necessary to launch more tests at the right moment,"" he said.\n\nLast month, when Manzhouli, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, was hit by a local outbreak, the city\'s testing capacity stood at some 12,000 samples per day.\n\nGuo Yanhong, an official at the National Health Commission\'s medical supervision and administration bureau, said that by sending medical assistance teams and mobile testing facilities to the city, as well as involving local third-party institutions, daily testing capacity in Manzhouli quickly rose to 152,000 samples.\n\nGuo said that as of last month, 30 million samples could be processed nationwide each day.\n\n""Also, to lessen the public\'s financial burden, most provincial-level regions have lowered the cost of a test per person to less than 40 yuan ($6.30) and to under 10 yuan for group tests,"" she said.\n\nLiang said, ""We have accumulated a complete and science-based tool kit to tackle the disease, including widespread nucleic acid tests, the ability to trace close contacts, deliver treatment, mobilize local communities, and ensure normal transportation and livelihoods.\n\n""It is not a single measure or strategy that works, but a combination of multiple factors－for instance, an altruistic spirit, as well as coordination between government departments.""\n\nStriking a balance\n\nAs China becomes increasingly efficient in tackling imported infections and local outbreaks, more emphasis has been placed on striking a balance between disease control requests and enabling people to live normal lives.\n\nMa Xiaowei, minister of the National Health Commission, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency, ""Virus control work should be precise and considerate, and local authorities should provide a range of supportive policies to reduce the impact on people\'s lives and production, and achieve the best results at the lowest possible social cost.""\n\nThe introduction of buffer zones in a number of border and port areas is an example of such efforts, according to authorities.\n\nLiang said, ""Villages in a port city where buffer zones are established can adopt stricter measures, including setting up checkpoints and imposing restrictions on people\'s movements, while the remaining areas of the city only need to impose regular disease control measures.\n\n""In the buffer zones, regular activities can take place when there are no new cases, but regular screening and health monitoring will be performed.""\n\nIn Yunnan province, authorities in Ruili city pioneered this approach due to the long border with Myanmar.\n\nLast year, the city experienced 42 local infection clusters triggered by imported infections, disrupting the once-booming jade trade.\n\nAccording to Liang, ""Establishing buffer zones can provide an additional barrier to protect against the virus being imported, further reducing the likelihood of it spilling over from high-risk areas.""\n\nOn Dec 19, authorities in Ruili said offline jade vendors located outside strictly regulated zones could resume business.\n\nZhang Guizhen, who owns a local jade business, said: ""On hearing this, I began tidying up my shop, preparing hand sanitizers, disinfectant and thermometers. It was great news for jade vendors.""\n\nIn October, a local COVID-19 outbreak was reported in Ejine Banner, Inner Mongolia, during the peak autumn tourist season. Local authorities said more than 9,000 visitors were stranded in the area.\n\nTo help them return home while ensuring their health and safety, the authorities drew up plans for rail passengers, individual travelers, motorists and those using buses.\n\nXu Xiuzhen, a traveler from Shanghai, said on the train journey home, ""Even though we were stranded, we were treated warmly, with the local authorities providing us with sufficient protective equipment, medical products and food.""\n\nComprehensive measures\n\nAs the new year dawns with the development of a number of vaccines and promising drugs to treat COVID-19, experts are discussing a possible end to the pandemic.\n\nZhong Nanshan, a prominent respiratory expert, said that before China returns to pre-pandemic life, the global death rate from COVID-19 should fall to about 0.1 percent. Last month, this rate was estimated at around 1 percent to 2 percent.\n\nIn addition, the virus\' basic reproduction rate, also known as R0, should be maintained at about 1 to 1.5, Zhong said. The reproduction rate for the Delta variant－the dominant strain worldwide－is estimated to fall between 5 and 8.\n\nTo achieve such goals, Zhong said the nation should expand vaccination coverage, enforce regular disease control measures at community level, and develop effective therapeutics.\n\nAs of Jan 7, more than 2.9 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered on the mainland, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nZhang Boli, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, who is a leading traditional Chinese medicine expert, said the pandemic would likely stabilize in spring, when China might ease its control policies.\n\n""However, opening up completely will depend on the global situation, especially outbreaks in some African countries where the average vaccination rate is only about 10 percent,"" he said, adding that high alertness and close observation of new strains are still needed.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40940-4', 'Headline': 'Effects of public-health measures for zeroing out different ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China. From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}}",96.875,1

Millions of Americans benefited from pandemic relief payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, and bolstered social programs.\n\nThese support mechanisms provided necessary help to many families during difficult times, but these same programs can discourage Americans from joining or rejoining the workforce—especially when increased earnings do not make up for the loss in benefits.\n\nAs businesses continue to grapple with a national workforce shortage, a flawed government benefits framework is one of many factors keeping Americans on the sidelines of the labor force.\n\nThis page dives deep into the effect pandemic benefits had on Americans\' financial wellness and unintended “benefit cliffs,” the point at which benefits are cut off, which can discourage labor market participation.\n\nThe impact of enhanced unemployment benefits\n\nDuring the pandemic, more than 20 million Americans received unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. From March 2020 to September 2021, the federal government provided an additional $300 - $600 a week to any person who was earning at least $1 in UI benefits.\n\nThe enhanced UI benefits were generous compared to regular UI benefits. On average, UI typically replaces 38% of a claimant’s average weekly wage.\n\nThe enhancement meant that most individuals were earning more on unemployment than they were while working, boosting Americans’ savings accounts, and deterring many from returning to work.\n\n24%\n\nThose who say government aid packages during the pandemic incentivized them to not actively look for work\n\n21%\n\nThose who say they never expect to be back to work full time\n\nSource: U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n\nEnhanced unemployment insurance and pandemic relief checks helped facilitate historic savings during the pandemic—as did the limited options for spending those savings as many normal spending options were unavailable, or significantly limited. Although those savings are coming down, in total, Americans saved about $2.7 trillion during the pandemic, 10% of the nation’s GDP.\n\nHistorically, layoffs and health emergencies stress Americans’ bank accounts and unemployed workers are eager to return to a steady paycheck. But during the pandemic, savings accounts broke with tradition and rose to unprecedented levels.\n\n$2.7 trillion\n\nThe amount Americans saved during pandemic, equal to 10% of the nation’s GDP\n\nDespite savings dwindling, labor force participation has not gone up\n\nMany Americans were able to live off the money they’d put aside, postponing a return to work. Now, more than a year out from pandemic checks and enhanced benefits, Americans are seeing their saving account dwindle with prices rising and spending on necessities resuming. But despite savings levels coming down, there has not been a substantial increase in the nation’s labor force participation.\n\nThe labor force participation rate still lags around one percentage point below where it was at the start of the pandemic, meaning nearly three million workers are still missing from the workforce.\n\nAlthough there are other barriers keeping Americans out of work, like access to childcare, navigating the loss of government benefits when earnings or savings increase is a contributing factor keeping Americans out of work right now.\n\nNavigating a loss in government benefits\n\nMost states provide 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. During that time, unemployed individuals are required to look for suitable employment and are often matched with reemployment services. Not all claimants find work by the time their UI benefits end, however. In these cases, additional government programs become critical.\n\nState and federal government benefit programs are available to assuage some difficult financial situations for low-income families and individuals. Benefits are administered at the state and federal level and most often are targeted toward a certain expense—food, care, and housing.\n\nA majority (70%) of public benefits go to non-elderly people who work, and more than half of all workers in the bottom 20% of the wage distribution receive public benefits.\n\n41 million\n\nPeople receiving SNAP benefits in 2021\n\n1 million\n\nFamilies receiving TANF benefits in 2020\n\n80.5 million\n\nPeople enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP in 2021\n\n2.2 million+\n\nFamilies receiving housing choice vouchers in 2021\n\nSource: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; County Health Executives Association of California; The Pew Charitable Trusts\n\nWhile many programs operate on a sliding scale, gradually phasing out as income rises (like SNAP benefits), some programs are terminated at the onset of increased earnings or accrued savings.\n\n$10,326\n\nAnnual value of Medicaid benefits when earned income reaches $11,000\n\n$7,552\n\nValue loss of annual SNAP benefits when income reaches $35,000\n\nThe sliding scale and income thresholds lead to what is known as the “benefits cliff”—the point at which benefits are cut off. In some situations, the increased earnings do not make up for the loss in benefits. For this reason, some recipients are deterred from obtaining employment, working additional hours, or pursuing promotions and career development.\n\nThe two charts below from a report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation describe the effect and severity of benefit cliffs.\n\nTake for example, public assistance in Durham County, North Carolina. Bundled public benefits decrease as earnings increase. However, if wages increase from $11,000 to $27,000 the family will experience a gap in health coverage between Medicaid and American Care Act subsidies because North Carolina is a non-expansion state for Medicaid.\n\n""Qualitative research reveals important insights about how employees navigate benefits cliffs,"" says Mathieu Despard, Ph.D., MSW. ""A 2016 study of benefit recipients in Cincinnati found that none of the recipients made a job or career decision based on impending benefits cliffs. Instead, these workers said they needed help in making the transition from public benefits to wage gains, such as budgeting for food amidst a loss in SNAP benefits, and that they felt worse off financially despite wage gains. Though workers preferred not to receive public benefits, they felt unprepared in losing these benefits.""\n\nA current snapshot of American’s financial wellness\n\nThe impact of benefits cliffs are especially relevant when considering the current financial wellness of Americans. With prices rising and pandemic savings dwindling, navigating benefits is more important than ever.\n\nDebt levels are beginning to rise again\n\nDebt levels declined during the pandemic, especially credit card debt. The drop in debt and rise in savings put consumers’ personal balance sheets in a strong position. However, debt levels are starting to rise as prices rise because of high inflation, the end of government pandemic benefits, and an increase in spending now that pandemic restrictions are mostly over.\n\nFurther, many did not pay their rent or mortgages during the pandemic. That moratorium is over which means they now need to make these large payments. With savings accounts no longer growing, prices rising, and spending on necessities resuming, Americans will see rising levels of debt as interest rates are climbing.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, overall debt levels have increased by 5.4%, according to the New York Federal Reserve. Credit card debt, however, decreased during the same timeframe. In 2021, Americans acquired mortgages, car payments, and personal loans while paying down credit cards.\n\nIt’s also interesting to note that a majority (61%) of American consumers are living paycheck to paycheck. While this standard financial lifestyle is most common among those who earn the least, living paycheck to paycheck exists across all income levels. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are precariously close to financial distress should an emergency occur.\n\n61%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck\n\n79.9%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn less than $50k\n\n63.8%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn $50k-$100k\n\n42.2%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn more than $100k\n\nA proper social net should encourage and enable labor market entry, financial stability, and economic mobility. However, the steep benefit cliffs discourage labor market participation and promotion.\n\nChanging the current framework would allow employers to fill open jobs and maximize productivity while also ensuring beneficiaries can reach self-sufficiency, build assets, and increase net worth. Policy changes that help achieve this balance include raising income limits, phasing out benefits more gradually, implementing continuous enrollment and transitional benefits, and eliminating asset tests.\n\nA new report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation takes a closer look at benefit cliffs and how proposed policy changes have affected the labor market when implemented in various states.

The last time that happened in metro Chicago was February 2020, a month before the city announced its first COVID-19 death.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in metro Chicago — which includes a total of 14 counties in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — remained below 4% again in both June and July.\n\nWhile it might be premature to declare an end to the regional economic emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of pre-pandemic unemployment levels for three consecutive months is, perhaps, a sign that the worst is behind us.\n\nWBEZ analyzed more than 20 years of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Current Population Survey to get a closer look at the region’s elevated unemployment rates during the pandemic. We wanted to see how they compared with rates during earlier times of economic upheaval. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSharper spike and speedier recovery\n\nIn April 2020, metro Chicago’s unemployment rate jumped nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month to 18.72%. That’s the highest jump and the highest rate in a single month since at least 1990, the earliest date for which regional unemployment data was available on the bureau’s website.\n\nBy January 2021, the unemployment rate had dipped below 7%. By November 2021, it fell below 5%, and it dropped below 4% this May. While unemployment took more than three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, it was a shorter recovery period compared to the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe economic downturn resulting from the housing market crash is considered to have lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During that window, the rise and fall of unemployment in metro Chicago was not nearly as dramatic as during the pandemic, and the higher rates dragged on for much longer. The region’s unemployment began its slow and steady ascent in August 2006, when it was 4.45%. That rate increased each month, reaching a peak of 11.49% in January 2010 — almost 3 1⁄2 years later. The rate slowly decreased over the next few years, but it didn’t dip below 5% until January 2017.\n\nUnequal patterns among racial groups\n\nNo racial or ethnic group of workers, no age group and no gender in metro Chicago was immune to the sting of the pandemic.\n\nBut for some groups, unemployment spiked higher or lasted longer, according to a WBEZ analysis of raw data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll of the U.S. labor force sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOnce the rates came down, they settled into the same unequal patterns that existed before the pandemic, the analysis shows.\n\nThe estimated unemployment for Latinos in metro Chicago skyrocketed at the onset of the pandemic — growing in April 2020 from under 6% to more than 23%. It would top 20% again in both May and June of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Black nor white workers saw rates top 20%. For white workers, unemployment also jumped dramatically from less than 4% to nearly 16% in April 2020. In that month, Black unemployment rose from under 9% to nearly 17%, a smaller increase than for the other groups. Black unemployment didn’t reach its peak of nearly 19% until August 2020, according to the WBEZ analysis.\n\nHowever, overall unemployment estimates for white and Latino workers settled back to pre-pandemic rates much faster than they did for Black workers. White unemployment fell below 4% for three straight months by October 2021. Latino unemployment dipped below 6% for three consecutive months by November 2021. Unemployment for Black workers in metro Chicago didn’t drop below 9% for three consecutive months until July 2023.\n\nIn addition, for much of the past two decades, Black unemployment estimates in the region have typically remained at least twice as high as those for white unemployment. Since 2000, the average monthly unemployment estimate for Black workers in metro Chicago has been about 12.63%, which is comparable to the 13.19% average monthly unemployment estimate for white workers during the four months when it was at its peak — from April to July of 2020.\n\nSince 2000, those were the only four months when white unemployment estimates topped 10% in metro Chicago. However, for Black workers, unemployment estimates have topped that mark in 209 months since 2000.\n\nEssential workers meant lower pandemic unemployment\n\nThe surge in Latino unemployment may have been influenced by the large share of Latino workers in the restaurant and food services industry, one that was hit hard during the earliest months of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, restaurant and food services was the leading industry for Latino workers in metro Chicago. But by April 2020, unemployment for restaurant and food service workers was nearly 45%. It didn’t fall back to single digits until September 2021.\n\nIn recent months, however, the industry appears to have rebounded. Restaurant-related unemployment has been below 4% in six of the eight months between December 2022 and July 2023. And the region’s estimated number of workers in that industry topped 340,000 in July 2023, the highest such figure since June 2019.\n\nAs it might be expected in a public health crisis, unemployment for hospital workers has been much lower and far more stable. It was just 4% in April 2020. It climbed to 10% in May 2020 before falling below 7% in June 2020.\n\nThe leading industry for Black workers in 2020 was hospitals, the WBEZ analysis shows. That might have helped keep Black unemployment from growing as dramatically as it did for other groups during the first few months of the pandemic.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://chicagocrusader.com/unemployment-soaring-in-21-chicago-black-neighborhoods/', 'Headline': 'Unemployment soaring in 21 Chicago Black neighborhoods', 'Snippet': 'May 24, 2022. 9:12 am.

Despite the sizzling job market, unemployment continues to plague many Black job seekers.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national unemployment rate in April was 3.6 percent. For white Americans, it was 3.2 percent that month and 5.9 percent for Black Americans.\n\nBut in Black Chicago, the numbers are much, much higher.\n\nA Crusader review of unemployment data shows that 23 Black neighborhoods have unemployment rates in the double digits. Eighteen of those neighborhoods have unemployment rates above 15 percent. Nine had unemployment rates over 19 percent in April.\n\nMost of the high unemployment rates occurred in neighborhoods on Chicago’s South Side, where poverty and disinvestment have been been a problem for decades.\n\nRiverdale had the highest unemployment rate at 29.9 percent. In Englewood, 24.9 percent of its residents do not have a job. In neighboring West Englewood, 24.5 percent of residents are out of work.\n\nIn West Pullman, the unemployment rate is 20.7 percent. In Bronzeville’s Oakland neighborhood the unemployment rate is 19.9 percent and in Greater Grand Crossing it’s 19.8 percent.\n\nOn Chicago’s West Side, West Garfield Park had the highest unemployment rate at 23.8 percent. In East Garfield Park, the unemployment was lower at 19 percent.\n\nAccording to the nonprofit organization Equity and Transformation, almost 80 percent of Black men in West Garfield Park whose ages range from 17 to 34 are unemployed and the annual median income is just over $24,000.\n\nWith gun violence a longstanding problem in the neighborhood, the organization said there’s a direct connection between unemployment and life expectancy.\n\nIn Austin, 13.4 percent of its residents are out of work and 10.9 percent of residents do not have a job in Humboldt Park.\n\nWith its affluent, college-educated residents, Hyde Park has the lowest unemployment rate on the South Side, where just 6.4 percent of people were out of work. Neighboring Kenwood’s unemployment rate is 9.2 percent.\n\nSince the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics first started collecting data on Black labor statistics in 1972, the Black unemployment rate has stayed at, or twice above the white unemployment rate.\n\nAnalysts say only highly educated Blacks and experienced Black workers have reached unemployment rates that have been nearly the same as their white counterparts.\n\nBut not all college-educated Blacks find success in the job market. Crain’s Chicago Business reported what many Blacks knew for years as they experienced barriers to employment.\n\nThe publication told the story of Stella Ashaolu, an MBA job seeker who couldn’t find employment after she graduated at the top of her class at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business.\n\nLike most Blacks, Ashaolu lacked the business networks that were often available to white educated job seekers.\n\nAshaolu went on to form WeSolv, a platform that connects companies to a network of 30,000 diverse MBA candidates.\n\nAccording to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, U.S. employers plan to hire 31.6 percent more college graduates this year compared to 2021. This means that the job market is relatively strong for Black graduates entering the workforce in 2022.\n\nAnd according to Black Enterprise magazine, the average starting salary for recent graduates is $55,260. However, Black college graduates who responded to a survey expected an average annual salary of $104,810. White college graduates expected to make $103,820 at their first job.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/03/covid-child-tax-credit-low-income-working-parents/673528/', 'Headline': ""Working Parents Can't Win in America - The Atlantic"", 'Snippet': 'March 27, 2023.

The deposits were an expansion of the child tax credit, meant to help families cope with the pressures of lockdown, and recipients no longer needed to earn a minimum income to be eligible. Unlike before, unemployed parents could benefit too. Reaching many of the families left out by other cash-aid programs, the expanded child tax credit lifted millions of kids out of poverty, reducing food insecurity and anxiety among low-income parents along the way. But amid concerns from politicians and pundits that the credit would discourage parents from working outside the home, Congress allowed it to expire at the end of 2021. The decision reflected a position toward needy families that has dominated policy making for decades: The government doesn’t just give money away. If parents want help, they’re going to have to work for it.\n\nIt wasn’t always this way. At the beginning of the previous century, the U.S. had the exact opposite stance—it insisted that mothers stay home with their children. In the early 1900s, most states created so-called mothers’ pensions, which provided cash payments to mothers without a breadwinning husband. In addition to upholding various character requirements, recipients were typically forbidden from working for pay. In 1935, these pensions morphed into Aid to Dependent Children (later Aid to Families With Dependent Children), a national program similarly designed to allow single mothers (and later, poor parents more generally) to stay home.\n\nThe shift to our current philosophy began during the 1960s, when the program was altered to encourage recipients to seek employment, though parents caring for kids younger than 6 were exempt. This exception disappeared in the ’90s, when the Clinton administration severely restrained cash aid to unemployed parents and increased the earned income tax credit, which ties cash assistance to parents directly to income. Today, the bulk of financial support available to parents in America is funneled through a collection of tax credits—up to a certain point, the more you earn, the more you get. The paid labor that was once a disqualification from aid is now a prerequisite for it.\n\nWhile no less overbearing than modern-day policies, the concept of the mothers’ pension made some sense, because it recognized that someone caring for a child already has a job. A lot has to go right for parents—particularly single parents, who still make up the majority of earned income tax credit recipients—to balance employment and child-rearing. Assuming the job can’t be done with a child in tow or from home at the parent’s convenience, a working parent needs child care. She also needs a schedule with enough predictability to arrange that child care. Finally, she needs the ability to take time off or adjust her schedule as circumstances require—to recover from childbirth, for example, or to care for a sick kid. Many American jobs lack these accommodations, a problem that has real consequences for American parents and children, but which policy makers have largely failed to address. This is a cruel contradiction of American family policy: It’s designed to reward working parents but does very little to enable parents to work—or workers to parent.\n\nBalancing work and child-rearing is difficult for U.S. parents across the income spectrum, but the conditions are particularly egregious among low-wage workers. The cost of market-rate child care, which in 2021 averaged more than $1,000 a month, is prohibitive for poor parents, and subsidized child care is hard to come by. The main program that provides subsidies for child care—the Child Care and Development Fund—serves less than a quarter of eligible families. Some parents who manage to obtain a subsidy struggle to keep it, because of the challenges of navigating the bureaucracy. Others find themselves suddenly ineligible after a small raise or a temporary bump in hours places them above the income threshold, Alejandra Ros Pilarz, who studies working families with low incomes at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. What’s more, finding a child-care provider who is willing to accept a subsidy is difficult, because the program’s reimbursements are often too low to cover the costs of providing care. More options are available once kids turn 3, such as Head Start and public pre-K in some states, but those programs likewise provide care to a fraction of the families they are intended to serve. And there is precious little in the way of subsidized after-school or summer care for older kids.\n\nBut the lack of child care is only part of the problem. Parents in huge swaths of the labor market lack flexible, predictable schedules. Employees in the food-service and retail industries, which account for nearly one in five American jobs and the majority of near-minimum-wage positions, tend to work highly volatile hours—30 hours one week, 10 the next, a night shift today, a morning shift tomorrow—with very little notice. As of 2021, more than 60 percent of service-industry workers get their schedule less than two weeks in advance; one quarter get it just three days ahead of time. “And then, once the schedule is published, it’s subject to change,” Daniel Schneider, a social-policy professor at Harvard and a co-director of the Shift Project, an organization that tracks job quality and scheduling practices in the service industry, told me. A fifth of workers report having to be on call, waiting at the ready to come into work but unpaid if they aren’t needed. Nearly three in four are required to keep their schedule open for work at all times.\n\nThe picture doesn’t look much better when it comes to leave. Many low-wage workers don’t meet the work-history requirements to qualify for the unpaid leave protected by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act—they may not have accumulated sufficient hours or stayed with the same employer long enough. The few existing state-run paid-parental-leave programs exclude a lot of low-wage workers for the same reason. According to research done by the Shift Project, only about half of service workers surveyed have any paid sick leave. Those who have it don’t get much—maybe not even enough to make it through flu season with a toddler—and many don’t feel they can actually use what little they get. “A lot of these work sites are chronically understaffed,” Kristen Harknett, a professor at UC San Francisco and a co-director at the Shift Project, told me. “So there can be pressure to come in, even when you’re sick.”\n\nThe erratic nature of much low-wage work severely limits a parent’s child-care options. For many, center-based child care is practically unusable, not only because many service jobs involve weekend and evening hours, but also because just-in-time, on-call work requires just-in-time, on-call child care, which is functionally impossible for formal child-care settings to provide. But even informal care is extremely difficult to arrange without predictability. Harknett and her colleagues investigated how parents with unpredictable schedules manage child care and found that, in the best-case scenario, a grandparent or other loved one functioned as a just-in-time carer. (I will stop to point out the irony here: Our insistence on pushing single parents into the labor force often necessitates that another family member remain out of it.) But “that requires that somebody be at your beck and call to provide child care for you whenever it’s needed,” Harknett said. “That’s pretty uncommon.” More often, parents relied on a patchwork of family members, friends, neighbors, and babysitters.\n\nPiecing together informal care on the fly is a time-consuming process, and these last-minute requests can strain parents’ relationships, Harknett told me. It’s also risky. When none of the usual standbys was around, Harknett found, parents who couldn’t afford to lose their job sometimes left a small child in the care of a young sibling, or entirely unsupervised. The lack of sick leave presents vulnerable parents with a similar set of terrible options: risk losing their job to care for a sick child, send the sick child to school or day care, or leave the sick child unattended.\n\nParents who simply cannot work under these conditions are largely locked out of America’s cash-aid programs. But even for many of those who manage to hold a job, the cost and chaos of doing so can undercut the benefit of the aid they get. Children exposed to varied and unstable care arrangements have more behavioral problems than children with regular care arrangements; schedule instability negatively affects not only kids’ behavior, but also their sleep, school attendance, and health. None of this should come as a surprise. “Children thrive from stable and predictable routines,” Harknett said. This is the consequence of making caregivers work for aid in a labor market that is hostile to them: It pits children’s different needs against one another, forcing parents to choose between hunger and neglect, between the hardship of going without a paycheck and the strain of keeping it.\n\nThe expanded child tax credit offered parents a meaningful counterweight to these pressures when, during the crisis of the pandemic, it became politically viable to give parents money for the job of parenting. And, despite the concerns about parents dropping out of the workforce, these cash payments didn’t seem to budge employment much at all. But as the threat of the virus has waned, so too has the momentum behind more-supportive policies for parents. President Joe Biden reintroduced these cash payments in his latest budget proposal, but few expect the item to survive negotiations.\n\nIf the U.S. is unwilling to help unemployed parents, then it should make a far greater effort to ensure that parenting and work are compatible. Expanding funding for the child-care-subsidy program to meet the needs of eligible families would be a great place to start, Pilarz told me. That would require increasing reimbursement rates for providers, including informal providers whom families call on for nights and weekends. Building up access to Head Start and public pre-K programs would help too. But no amount of child care will make up for the chaotic conditions under which low-income Americans are expected to work. “We have to look for solutions both on the child-care side and on the employment side,” Pilarz said.\n\nThat could mean passing truly universal paid-family-leave laws, as well as laws for paid sick leave. It might also mean a national policy requiring employers to give workers at least two weeks’ notice of work schedules. Research suggests that these so-called fair-workweek laws, already on the books in a handful of cities and two states, make life meaningfully easier for working parents. But a more thorough transformation of the service industry would likely be required to address the thornier problem of understaffing, which creates strong pressure to go to work at all costs, Harknett told me. Ideally, employers would give workers some control over their schedule, allowing them to safeguard certain hours of the day.\n\nAmerica wants to have it both ways: insisting that poor single parents work while shrugging its shoulders about the conditions that can prevent them from doing so. The result is a system both careless and cruel. If we want needy parents to work, then we ought to take steps to ensure that it’s possible for them to both work and parent well. If we’re unwilling to take those steps, then we should find a way to support families regardless of whether they work or not. And if we won’t do either, then we must admit that we aren’t really interested in helping parents at all.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.chicagolandchamber.org/chamber-news/chamber-government-relations-team-gets-big-wins-in-veto-and-lame-duck-sessions/', 'Headline': 'Chamber Government Relations Team Gets Big Wins in ""Veto"" and ""Lame ...', 'Snippet': 'Advocacy efforts from the Chamber’s public policy team push Chicagoland towards a more business-friendly environment.

Legislators gathered back in November for the first time since adjournment in April 2022 for a two-week Veto Session. The two-week term was rather quiet, with legislators opting to leave many of the “bigger” issues unresolved until the Lame Duck Session, which ran from January 4 through January 11.\n\nWith numerous proposals being considered during that time, the Chicagoland Chamber worked to ensure that the interests of the Chicago business community were well represented.\n\nChamber and Business Groups Negotiate Successful Resolution of Historic $4.5B Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund Deficit\n\nDuring the 2022 fall Veto Session and January 2023 Lame Duck Session, the Chamber, working with business partner organizations, labor representatives, the Governor’s Office, and the General Assembly, agreed to a package that eliminates the $4.5 billion Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund deficit that accumulated during the early days of the pandemic, saving employers nearly a billion dollars in higher unemployment insurance taxes.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, the Chamber and other business groups successfully negotiated the utilization of $2.7 billion of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to be applied to the $4.5 billion Title XII debt incurred during the pandemic—largely in 2020, when government-mandated closures and operating restrictions were imposed on businesses. At the time, almost every other state used ARPA funds for repaying UI trust fund debt. Per federal law, when a state Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund drops to a negative balance, federal funds are automatically borrowed. If the borrowing occurs for a period of two or more years, employers lose credit against their federal unemployment insurance tax—meaning employers will pay higher taxes.\n\nIn September 2022, the Pritzker Administration swapped $450 million from the state UI Trust Fund balance to further pay down a portion of the $1.8 billion federal Title XII debt left outstanding after the $2.7 billion payment was made in mid-2022. Then in December, Governor Pritzker signed SB 1698 (P.A. 102-1105) to provide for the substantive language of the deal, which (1) authorizes the State to use surplus revenues to pay the remaining $1.36 billion Title XII debt and (2) provides for the substantive agreement reached between business and labor groups. The final deal will mitigate tax increases on employers, improve predictability for employers, and bring greater stability to the UI Trust Fund, which was an initial ask of the labor groups. The deal is fair for both employers and workers. In the January Lame Duck Session, SB 2801 passed both the Illinois House and Senate to provide for the appropriation language necessary to finalize the agreement. It is expected that the Governor will sign the bill soon.\n\nThe UI deal is significant for Illinois employers and negates roughly $913 million in additional taxes that employers would have had to pay over the next five years. Perhaps, just as importantly, the deal and bipartisan roll call that ensued preserves the Unemployment Insurance Agreed Bill process, which has been in place since the 1980s and informally requires any legislation impacting the Unemployment Insurance System from advancing without an agreement from both business and labor groups. Without the agreed bill process, we most certainly would see annual employer tax increases. You can find the Chamber and business coalitions fact sheet on the agreement here.\n\nBusiness Development Proposal Passes with Chamber’s Strong Support\n\nEvery year, the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce advocates for more State funding, support, and investment by the State in business development. Although the State has many programs and services in place that are meant to help employers throughout the state, amendments are often required.\n\nThe Government Relations team successfully managed to secure transformational changes to some of these state programs, including the following:\n\nGovernor’s “Invest in Illinois” Program: Given the State received an unexpected amount of tax revenue in 2022, due in large part to the lingering positive impact of the pandemic on consumer spending and business earnings, the Governor proposed the creation of a “closing fund”, which would grant the State the ability to offer new or existing businesses that are relocating, expanding, or making substantial investments in Illinois the ability to offer one-time cash grants to incentivize the projects. Other states, such as Ohio, Texas, among others, have perennial closing funds that they use to attract projects to their states. This year, the General Assembly headed the call and created the Invest in Illinois Program. $400 million were allocated to the program this year.\n\nEDGE Tax Credit Program. The bill (1) increases EDGE credits in projects located in underserved areas equal to 50% of the tax attributed to retained employees, (2) erodes the ‘but for” clause requiring EDGE credit applicants from demonstrating other State offers and cost differentials; and (3) reduces the requirement to self-certification. The EDGE program is one of the State’s biggest economic development tools used to attract and retain jobs in Illinois through a series of income and payroll tax credits.\n\nFilm Tax Credit Program. Extends the sunset date of the program from January 1, 2027 to January 1, 2033 to allow prospective film or TV productions to have reliability in the program. The Film Tax Credit Program each year helps sustain the rapid growth of the film and TV industry in Illinois by offering productions with several tax incentives to film in Illinois.\n\nExpands Enterprise Zones. Expands the allowable square mileage of a Zone. The EZ program allows for various tax benefits to be offered to businesses that are activated in a Zone.\n\nImproves High Impact Business Program. Doubles the length of an allowable designation of a HIB and removes the requirement for businesses to prove that the incentive is needed. HIB is a tool that the State offers large business expansions or investments in new projects in the State.\n\nREV Credit Program. Expands the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles (REV) in Illinois Act (currently, Reimagining Electric Vehicles in Illinois Act) to allow renewable energy product manufacturers to be eligible for REV credits, in addition to changing eligibility requirements to allow small-to-mid size businesses to apply for the credit. REV was first created in 2021 to incentivize new electric vehicle manufacturers and component part manufacturers to build in Illinois.\n\nMakes changes to the MICRO Act to grant DCEO the ability to determine criteria for the renewal of incentives provided under the Act. Increases the amount of MICRO credits for projects meeting retained employee goals to match new employee incentives. Allows for MICRO credits to be renewed for a total of either 20 or 30 years.\n\nCreates a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchase sales tax credit from fuel purchased in Illinois by an air carrier from June 1, 2023 to January 1, 2033 in the amount of $1.50 per gallon of sustainable fuel. Prohibits the collection of the credit on soybean oil-derived SAF until air carriers collectively purchase SAF containing 10 million gallons of soybean oil feedstock.\n\n“Paid Leave for All Workers Act” Passes, Chamber Negotiates Deal\n\nPaid Leave is an issue that has been hotly debated for over five years in the Statehouse, with advocates typically leading the way to push for convoluted, onerous, and punitive proposals on employers. An agreement was finally brokered last week—with the Chamber playing a key role in making sure the best deal for business was reached.\n\nOnce it was clear that advocacy groups, unions, and Democratic leadership were eager to pass a bill in the last week of Session before the start of a new term, the business community came to the negotiating table seeking two main provisions: (1) require that any paid leave law passed by the General Assembly would be clear, easily implemented, and require no more than five days of leave and (2) prohibit the City of Chicago or Cook County (both jurisdictions that already have paid sick leave mandates in place) from enacting their own version of paid leave. In the end, through much negotiation, the final bill that has been sent to the Governor for his signature will contain the following:\n\n5 days of paid time off a year\n\nThere is no requirement for an employee to qualify why their leave is being taken, easing the administrative burden on employers\n\nThe employer may establish a specific process by which an employee may request time off if the request is made prospectively\n\nThe time may be front loaded or rolled-over\n\nExempts collective bargaining agreements\n\nRequires employers to maintain proper records for no less than three years\n\nFor employers that already have a leave policy in place that meets the requirements of this new law, no policy change is required\n\nProhibits retaliation\n\nAllows the Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL) to investigate any claims alleging a violation of the Law, and allows the IDOL to impose fines ranging from $500-$1000 for violations of the act, in addition to legal awards and additional civil penalties.\n\nThe new Law will go into effect on January 1, 2024 and does not apply to any employer that is currently subject to the paid sick leave ordinances that are in effect in the City of Chicago or Cook County.\n\nOther Notable Action\n\nSB 1720 (Sims/Harris) – FY23 BIMP 2.0, which has passed both Chambers and needs to be signed into law by 12 p.m. on January 16 in order for the salary increases to go into effect. Notable provisions include:\n\nProvides for increased salaries for Constitutional Officers, Agency Directors, and members of the General Assembly\n\nThe establishment of the Warehouse Safety Standards Task Force\n\n$5 million to DCEO to administer a Local Chamber Recovery Grants program\n\nAllows the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board to make grants to local units of governments and schools for the purpose of hiring and retaining law enforcement officials\n\nIncreases the cap on the Budget Stabilization Fund from 5% to 7.5% of total general funds estimated for the fiscal year and transfer $850 million from GRF to the Budget Stabilization Fund\n\nProvides the authorizing language to appropriate $460 million to hospitals throughout Illinois as hospital pandemic recovery stabilization payments\n\nProvides that, if and only if House Bill 4285 of the 102nd General Assembly becomes law, then the small purchase limit in the Procurement Code is reduced from $250,000 to $100,000\n\nHB 969 (Harris/Harmon) – FY23 Supplemental Appropriations package\n\nSB 2801 (Holmes/Welch) – Finalizes the agreed-bill Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund deal to (1) appropriate $1.37 billion from GRF to UI Trust Fund to pay the remaining outstanding federal UI Title VII debt and (2) appropriate $450 million to the UI Trust Fund as a loan to be repaid over a 10-year period. The bill as amended by the House Exec Committee unanimously is awaiting House Floor action before going back to the Senate for concurrence.\n\nSB 1001 (Belt/Zalewski) – Eliminates state and local fees for liquor delivery throughout Illinoi and brings parity for liquor delivery between home-rule and non-home rule municipalities to regulate liquor delivery.\n\nHB 240 (Jones/Gillespie) – Hospital and health care omnibus package\n\nHB 4412 (Willis/Cunnningham) as amended by SA #1 – Limited changes to various energy-related provisions. The most controversial changes pertain to facility siting changes opposed by some units of local government.\n\nHB 268 (Williams/Feigenholtz) as amended by SA #1 – Creates the Tourism Preservation and Sustainability District Act, otherwise known as Tourism Improvement Districts. Similar to Business Improvement Districts, the legislation allows hotel owners to opt into a districts whereby special surcharges are assessed to be used only for the development, services, and benefits of the businesses contained in the Tourism Improvement District. The Chamber continues to discuss a similar model known as Business Improvement Districts with the City of Chicago and other stakeholders.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://newschannel20.com/news/local/new-data-shows-illinois-has-a-higher-unemployment-rate-than-national-average', 'Headline': 'New data shows Illinois has a higher unemployment rate than ... - WICS', 'Snippet': 'The national average unemployment rate is at 3.5%.

Almost a quarter (24%) say government aid packages during the pandemic have incentivized them to not actively look for work. Meanwhile, one in five have been able to channel money from government programs like rent or mortgage assistance to help make ends meet.\n\nHealth concerns and caring for others are top reasons why they aren’t actively looking\n\nOver a quarter (28%) of respondents say they’ve been ill, and their health has taken priority over them looking for work (unchanged from November 2021). Additionally, 27% say the need to be home and care for children or others has made it difficult or impossible to search for full time employment (this is up four points from November 2021). Still, women were more likely to say that staying home to care for children or others in the family is a barrier for them returning to work (36%, compared to 16% of men).\n\nYounger respondents, aged 25-34, are prioritizing personal growth over searching for a job right now; 36% say they’re more focused on acquiring new skills, education or training before re-entering the job market.\n\nIncentives to bring people back to work have lost some of their impact\n\nWhen asked what would increase their urgency to return to full time employment, the top three incentives were a hiring bonus of $1,000 (36%, down from 46% in November 2021), flexible work hours (31%, down from 43% in November 2021), and a positive work environment (30%, down from 41% in November 2021).\n\nThe option to work remotely is extremely favorable. Three in four (73%) are strongly opposed to jobs that require you to be in the office full-time. About half (49%) of the unemployed are not willing to take jobs that do not offer the opportunity for remote work; one in four (24%) are strongly opposed.\n\nNearly one in three want to, and expect to, switch industries\n\nJust under a third (30%) prefer to work in a different industry than the one they last worked in (statistically unchanged from the 32% who said the same in November 2021). If they return to work, 30% said they are likely to switch industries. Of those likely to change industries, 39% previously worked in leisure/hospitality, 32% in retail, and 29% in manufacturing.\n\nDownload the full report findings\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation launched America Works, a nationwide initiative mobilizing industry and government to swiftly address America’s deepening worker shortage crisis.

But he says ‘Ashli Babbitt’.""\n\nThat is how Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt, described the way Donald Trump talks about her daughter, who died one year ago today on 6 January, 2021, while trying to overturn the former president’s election defeat.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old US Air Force veteran from San Diego, California, was shot dead by a police officer as she climbed through the window of a barricaded door inside the Capitol building. She was part of a crowd of Trump supporters that had stormed the seat of the US Senate to stop it ratifying the election result, with some allegedly planning to do so by armed force.\n\nIn a less polarised era, American politicians in both parties might have rallied around the officer who shot her. Today, though, she has become a martyr to many of Mr Trump’s followers, praised and venerated by a movement that is increasingly willing to endorse political violence to keep its opponents out of power.\n\nRepublican members of congress including Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Matt Gaetz of Florida have taken up her cause, as have Fox News, the pro-Trump TV station Newsmax and even Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne right-wing group, Look Ahead America, has called for a vigil in Babbitt’s name for those in prison awaiting trial for their alleged actions on 6 January. Donations to a ""Justice for Ashli Babbitt legal fund"" continue to pour in, with more than $378,000 (£278,500) raised as of Wednesday.\n\nFollow live updates on the January 6 anniversary\n\nMr Trump himself has been her cheerleader in chief, referring to her death as a murder. and offering her family his ""unwavering"" support"". ""To Ashli’s family and friends, please know that her memory will live on in our hearts for all time,"" he said in a video specially filmed for her birthday on 10 October. ""There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli.""\n\nTerrorism experts and anti-racist groups find the former president’s intervention deeply disturbing, comparing it to the way Islamic fundamentalists and the Nazi Party in the 1940s used manufactured martyrs to inspire further acts of violence.\n\nFor Cara Castronuova, a pro-Trump activist who co-founded the group Citizens Against Political Persecution to advocate for alleged January 6 rioters, it is a vindication of many months fighting to reframe the storming of the Capitol as a peaceful protest and its alleged invaders as political prisoners.\n\n""At first her name was taboo, even in conservative media,"" Ms Castronuova tells The Independent. ""Nobody would talk about her, nobody would mention her, nobody would mention anybody’s name from 6 January. There was a three to four month block of time at the beginning of 2020... and then it just snowballed.""\n\nWho was Ashli Babbitt?\n\nWhen Ashli Babbitt quit the US military in 2016, she left at the rank of senior airman with 12 years of service and eight deployments behind her. Having enlisted in the US Air Force (USAF) straight out of high school in 2003, she protected bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, protected USAF bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Katar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAt one point, she had even guarded the seat of the US government, serving in an Air National Guard unit known as the ""Capital Guardians"" at a base near Washington DC. In 2013, she was part of the DC Air National Guard’s security detail for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nBabbitt grew up in Lakeside, California, not far from San Diego, the oldest sister to four younger brothers. One former classmate told Insider that she was ""disruptive"" in class, highly opinionated and always trying to be ""one of the guys"".\n\nThat bolshy nature survived throughout her service, with former comrades saying she struggled to be promoted and was demoted at least once due to spats with superiors. One friend described her as ""small but mighty"" (Babbitt was 5 feet 2 inches tall), unafraid to contradict her officers when she disagreed.\n\n""Ashli was headstrong and impulsive,"" said Sgt Eirik Blackwolf, who served with her in the DC Air National Guard. ""She didn’t hold back on her opinion to anyone, no matter their rank, especially if she thought they were wrong or behaving unethically.""\n\nDuring one deployment Babbitt was injured in a mortar strike that knocked her onto a pile of debris. Augustine Luna, a close friend, told Insider that the impact damaged Babbitt’s uterus and left her unable to bear children, but that Babbitt rarely mentioned this.\n\nIn 2015 Babbitt began working as a private security guard for a nuclear power plant in Maryland, where she met her future second husband Aaron Babbitt. That was also the year Mr Babbitt’s then-girlfriend Celeste Norris first encountered Ashli.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ms Norris said Mr Babbitt at first described the new girl as ""this foul-mouthed chick that’s on shift"". Later, Ms Norris found out the two were dating, and broke up with Mr Babbitt.\n\nThe next year, Ms Norris said, she was waiting at a stop sign when a white SUV barged through nearby traffic and repeatedly rammed into her car. When they stopped, Babbitt got out and began hammering with her hand on the window. ""It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was,"" said Ms Norris. ""Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.""\n\nA court acquitted Babbitt of criminal charges, but Ms Norris secured a restraining order against her, and later mounted a personal injury lawsuit that Babbitt settled out of court. In court documents from 2017, Ms Norris wrote that Babbitt had continued to follow her home from work and harass her. ""I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,"" she told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Babbitt moved to San Diego to help buy out and run a swimming pool supply company where her brothers, her uncle and her husband all worked together. ""It was kind of nice, a family affair,"" her brother Roger said.\n\nBabbitt and her husband became daily customers at a brewery near the San Diego sea front, often with their three ex-military dogs in tow. According to brewery owner Jim Millea, the pair had a polyamorous relationship with one of his bartenders. Babbitt herself often arrived fuming about a political issue that had grabbed her attention.\n\nYet the pool supply business quickly got into trouble. Babbitt took out a short term business loan with a steep interest rate and was sued by the lender for failing to make payments, ultimately being ordered by a judge to pay it all back. In 2019, she sold the house where her parents had lived for nearly 20 years, reportedly making them feel ""kicked out of their own home"".\n\nBy this time, Babbitt was a staunch Trump supporter and an opponent of lockdown measures. Her company’s office bore a sign reading: ""Mask-free autonomous zone, better known As America"".\n\nHer brother told the New York Times that she had felt free after leaving the military, and had been angry with the number of homeless people in San Diego and the challenges for small business owners.\n\nOne customer told CBS 8 San Diego that he dropped Babbitt’s company after she went on an unprovoked political rant. “She just started talking about people who oppose Trump and about Nancy Pelosi and [Chuck] Schumer and homeless people,"" the customer said. ""A lot of it didn’t even make any sense. It literally went on for about a minute and a half... it was shocking that she would be talking to a customer the way she was talking to me.""\n\nEven so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents. ""I don’t really know why she decided to do this,"" her mother-in-law toldFox 5 Washington DC last year.\n\nHer social media accounts, however, told an all too familiar story.\n\n‘Nothing will stop us’\n\nOn 7 September, 2020, tweeting under the username @CommonSenseAsh, Ashli Babbitt posted a photo of herself smiling in sunglasses and a black tank top, posing in front of an old-fashioned boat in the harbour of San Diego.\n\nTo many the photo might have looked innocuous, a happy selfie from a nice day out. But her shirt bore the slogan ""We are Q"" – a reference to the anonymous purported government insider who inspired the cult-like millenarian movement known as QAnon.\n\nFor almost a year, Babbitt had been posting in support of QAnon, which believes Mr Trump’s Democratic opponents are part of a global Satanist paedophile ring. Adherents think Mr Trump himself is the figurehead for a secret plot by ""white hats"" (ie, good guys) to sweep the Satanists from power in a military coup, resulting in mass imprisonment or execution.\n\nThe movement has been tied to violent acts including murders, kidnappings, terror plots, attempted bombings, and vehicular attacks, as well as campaigns of online harassment and death threats.\n\nBabbitt’s radical shift came gradually. Back in 2018, she had told another user that she had voted for Barack Obama and still believed he had done ""great things"", but had turned to Mr Trump because she could not stomach Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Ms Luna, Babbitt had voted for Trump in 2016 because he was not a career politician, but soon began calling Democrats ""commies"" and skirmished aggressively offline and online with anyone who disputed her anti-mask beliefs.\n\nIn November 2019, she tweeted about Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that went viral among Trump supporters in 2016 and was a key precursor to QAnon. Online activists had fixated on chance words in hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders as evidence of a secret child sex dungeon beneath a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. Later one of them stormed the restaurant with a rifle to rescue the supposed children, but found nothing.\n\nIn February 2020, Babbitt tweeted her first of many QAnon slogans. Most often she retweeted QAnon influencers such as the lawyer Lin Wood. Ms Luna told Insider that Babbitt was drawn in by the idea that children were in danger, spending hours every week reading about missing kids and appalled that QAnon’s claims were not being taken seriously in the mainstream media.\n\nAccording to Prof Mia Bloom, a terrorism researcher at Georgia University, QAnon’s appeals to ""save the children"" are ""almost verbatim"" how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) recruited three British schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, London, in 2015.\n\n""This kind of message that builds upon someone’s innate goodness is a very different pathway into terrorism than we ordinarily think,"" says Prof Bloom. ""We assume that it’s about hatred, it’s about violence, it’s about racism and white supremacy on the Right and jihadi ideology for [Islamic] groups, when in fact a lot of the pull factors can be based in what we would consider to be very positive attributes.""\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Babbitt did not accept the results of the 2020 election and plunged wholeheartedly into the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. On 1 January, 2021, Babbitt tweeted that she would be in Washington DC on the 6th for a rally addressed by Mr Trump.\n\nOn 5 January, she boarded a plane in San Diego and texted to her friend that there were ""tons of Trump supporters"" flying with her. Another user tweeted that some flights to DC were being cancelled, supposedly to prevent people from attending the 6 January rally.\n\nBabbitt replied: ""Nothing will stop us. They can try and try and try, but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.""\n\nWhen Trump’s army stormed the Capitol, Ashli Babbitt was among the mob that gathered in a stairwell near the chamber of the House of Representatives, where up to 80 members of congress and staff were sheltering. She was wearing a Trump flag on her shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe crowd began hammering on the doors out of the stairwell, which were barricaded from the other side with furniture. One window broke, and Ashli Babbitt, who was unarmed, climbed through. A gunshot rang out, and she fell back with a bullet in her shoulder.\n\nPro-Trump activists have found their George Floyd\n\nLast August, the police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt finally broke his silence. For months Lt Michael Byrd, who is black, had been in hiding due to repeated death threats and racist attacks after Mr Trump falsely claimed he worked for a ""high-ranking"" Democratic politician.\n\n""I know that day I saved countless lives,"" Lt Byrd told NBC News. “I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nBabbitt did not become a Trumpist hero overnight. The day after the riot, Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin, who saw Babbitt’s death, said that Lt Byrd had not had any choice. ""The mob was going to come through the door,"" he told ABC. ""There was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many Trump supporters believed she was a plant or a stooge, put into the crowd by the FBI or other dark forces. In April, the US Department of Justice closed its investigation with no criminal charges.\n\nBy the time of Lt Byrd’s interview, however, Babbitt’s name had become a clarion call in what Ms Castronuova calls the conservative ""underground"" of alternative media and social media. Ms Castronuova was among the first people to interview Babbitt’s family on InfoWars, a fringe news site that often promotes conspiracy theories and has been banned from most major social networks for hate speech.\n\n""[Trump] is really in tune with the community, his base,"" Ms Castronuova says. ""The underground will start to buzz, then Donald Trump picks up on it."" Soon enough, at rallies and in interviews last summer, Mr Trump was calling Babbitt ""an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman"", someone who was on his ""side"", and said there was ""no reason for"" her to die. Ms Castronuova says his backing was ""instrumental"".\n\nMr Trump’s efforts increased after a personal phone call to Mrs Witthoeft, who had become politically active. She has now spoken at a Trump rally and has backed her daughter’s actions, saying: ""She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.""\n\nMs Castronuova says: ""[Babbitt’s] mother has been really instrumental too. She became quite an advocate. She was afraid to speak out at first... but when she finally started speaking out, things really started to change.""\n\nBabbitt’s family sued the District of Columbia to uncover Lt Byrd’s identity, and plans to file wrongful death lawsuits against Lt Byrd himself and the Capitol Police. Terrell Roberts III, a lawyer for Babbitt’s husband Aaron, declined to comment and declined an interview on Mr Babbitt’s behalf.\n\nDonations to Mr Babbitt’s legal fund continue to roll in, with many donors identifying themselves as military veterans. Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating Democratic secrets.\n\nMany Trump supporters have compared Babbitt to George Floyd, a black man murdered by police in Minnesota, lifting the Black Lives Matter slogan ""say her name"" used in reference to many victims of police brutality.\n\nOn the private messaging app Telegram, which is popular on the far right, pro-Trump channels frequently invoke Babbitt’s name, sharing news articles about her family’s lawsuit or claiming that she was set up by informants. Many asked the question ""who killed Ashli Babbit?"" which Mr Trump later echoed.\n\n""The entire scenario looks to be staged. So who is the rotting fish head of what appears to be a deliberate false flag? Who or what group set this up?"" said the evangelist channel Veteran Patriots. The Proud Boys, a fascist militia, have begun using a stylised image of Babbitt as a logo, with the slogan: ""They can’t kill us all.""\n\nBritish radicals have also taken up her cause. ""Her name was Ashli Babbitt,"" said British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. ""She was murdered by the state and her name was dragged through the mud by the media."" An account identifying itself as former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has invoked her name several times.\n\nSome appear to believe she is not even dead. ""Ashli Babbitt false [is a] flag, she’s alive living underground,"" said a QAnon channel called Gitmo TV.\n\n‘A weapon of mass radicalisation’\n\nTo Prof Bloom, Babbitt’s transformation into an innocent victim of Leftist injustice has a worrying historical echo: Horst Wessel, the young Nazi street-fighter who was turned into a symbol of fascist heroism by Josef Goebbel’s propaganda apparatus.\n\nWessel was shot in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party, probably as part of a dispute over unpaid rent with his Communist landlady. By 1936, after the Nazis took power, official media referred to him as greater than Jesus Christ and the Horst Wessel Song was Germany’s joint national anthem.\n\n""Fake martyrdoms succeed because they feed off the shared grievances and anger of the crowd, serving as justification for future retaliatory violence,"" wrote Prof Bloom and another researcher, Sophia Moskalenko, with whom Prof Bloom has co-authored a book about QAnon. ""Ashli Babbitt’s unfortunate death is a weapon of mass radicalisation, just like Horst Wessel’s death was manipulated by Goebbels.""\n\nIndeed, the Nazis’ modern successors have particularly embraced Babbitt, turning an enthusiastic Trump supporter with a chequered past who was killed in a chaotic riot into a towering hero or innocent victim of police brutality while seeking to pin the blame on black and Jewish people.\n\n""Unlike ‘Saint Floyd’, Ashli Babbitt will receive no justice from this sick anti-white system,"" said one white supremacist Telegram channel. ""But we will always remember her sacrifice and she will never be forgotten. There is a day coming not far from now when we will erect statues in her honor.""\n\nThe same channel referred to Lt Byrd as a ""black parasite who gets to kill an unarmed white woman and walk around unbothered"", threatening to make him ""account for his actions"". Another neo-Nazi channel claimed that ""Ashli Babbitt was killed because she was white"".\n\nAlex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates against antisemitism and other forms of racism, says such messages are part of a widespread effort by white supremacists to lure recruits from the broader pro-Trump community.\n\n""White supremacists will always try to twist whatever major story is in the news to fit their agenda,"" says Mr Friedfeld. It’s unclear how successful these efforts have been, but the fact that they are trying to leverage the Babbitt story is deeply concerning because it raises the likelihood that someone is radicalised.""\n\nProf Bloom agrees, comparing it to the Proud Boys’ attempts last summer to recruit ""incel"" anti-feminists. She says that while many QAnon believers are not consciously racist, and not all are white, the movement has a pervasive racial bias, with trafficked children usually depicted as white whereas real world child trafficking disproportionately affects children of colour.\n\nProf Bloom also points out that another protester, Rosanne Boyland, died during the riot but has not been turned into a martyr in the same way. The reason, she argues, is that unlike Babbitt’s family, the Boyland’s have blamed Mr Trump for their loved one’s death.\n\nA threat from within America’s military\n\nThe martyrdom of Ashli Babbitt paints a foreboding picture of where American politics is going. To Prof Bloom and Prof Moskalenko, martyrs are a ubiquitous manufactured product of radical movements, useful because of their potency in rallying followers to stay in the fight and seek revenge against the enemy.\n\nMs Castronuova stops short of saying Babbitt was an example others should follow, describing her as a good person sucked into an ""emotionally charged"" and chaotic situation. She is happy to call Babbitt a martyr, claiming: ""She was killed because of her political beliefs, and they continue to kill her image and her memory because of her political beliefs. If she was a liberal and she hated Donald Trump, she would be remembered very fondly by the media.""\n\nMr Friedfelder, however, fears that Babbitt’s lionisation could contribute to an escalating cycle of conflict, and considers politicians’ embrace of Babbitt to be dangerous. While most Republicans have not embraced the idea that she was unjustly killed, few have publicly rebuked it, apparently reluctant to openly challenge Mr Trump even now he is out of office.\n\nThat does not mean they are happy behind the scenes. On Wednesday Mr Trump cancelled a press conference on the anniversary of the riot, reportedly under pressure from mainstream Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he had played golf with Mr Trump at the weekend and warned him that there ""could be peril"" in such an event. Still, history suggests that Mr Trump’s concessions to moderates are rarely permanent.\n\nMr Friedfelder says: ""Her martyrdom turns her into a call to action... it is one thing for extremists to embrace Babbitt, but it is another for the former president and several high-profile members of the Republican Party to do the same. These officials are supposed to be trusted figures and people look to them for guidance when trying to understand national events.""\n\nClaims that Babbitt was murdered or assassinated continue to spread on social media, according to data from the online discussion tracking firm Zignal Labs. Mr Trump’s and Mr Putin’s comments caused spikes in mentions of Babbitt, and the general discussion around 6 January has barely waned over the past year.\n\nProf Bloom believes there is a more acute threat too: Babbitt’s military record. According to a report from START, an academic coalition that studies terrorism, at least 118 of the 719 people charged in connection with the riot, about 16 per cent of the whole, are veterans. In a START extremism database, about 7 per cent of all far-right cases had military experience, with the rest simply listed as unknown.\n\n""We don’t know how many American military [members] have been radicalised, either by MAGA or specifically by QAnon and white supremacy,"" says Prof Bloom. ""There has been a problem of white supremacy in the military for decades that the military has been reticent to deal with.\n\n""It’s dangerous because it’s not just some flunky who wants to make a name for themselves. It’s someone with military training who has weapons and knows how to use them."" She compares most pro-Trump extremists with the bumbling jihadists in 2010’s Four Lions, with lots of anger but limited ways to direct it. ""When you have someone who has been trained by the military or law enforcement, they know how to use that anger.""\n\nProf Moskalenko worries that the conditions are set for yet more political violence in America. ""A martyrdom is a symbol of perceived widespread injustice and suffering. There’s a lot of that going around,"" she says. ""With or without Ashli Babbit, we have problems. Addressing them, rather than getting stuck in the never-ending cycle of rhetoric, competing narratives, and shifting moral frames, is our only hope.""'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://reason.com/2022/01/04/ashli-babbitts-violent-past-doesnt-justify-her-death/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's Violent Past Doesn't Justify Her Death - Reason.com"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt\'s Violent Past Doesn\'t Justify Her Death. After the cops killed her, the A.P. gave her the ""no angel"" treatment. On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli ...', 'Full_text': 'On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli Babbitt, the Capitol rioter who was shot and killed by a police officer while trying to enter the Speaker\'s Lobby on January 6. In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-breach/police-chief-turned-yoga-instructor-insists-ashli-babbitt-is-not-dead-before-jan-6-judge-locks-him-up-for-more-than-a-decade/', 'Headline': ""Alan Hostetter insists Ashli Babbitt didn't die on Jan. 6 - Law & Crime"", 'Snippet': 'The shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.

Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas.

The officer’s actions were consistent with the officer’s training and USCP policies and procedures.”\n\nWhen that investigation concluded in August 2021, authorities had not released the name of the officer who pulled the trigger, citing “numerous credible and specific threats” against him.

It relied on an interpretation of Jan. 6 footage from a right-wing outlet that made unsubstantiated claims about Babbitt’s words, actions and frame of mind in the moments before she died.\n\nIn reality, there is no clear evidence that Babbitt was fighting to halt the mob — or that the attack was a false flag spurred on by antifa.\n\nThe insurrection was carried out by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, many of them whipped up by his false claims of a stolen election. The officer who fired the bullet that killed Babbitt — Lt. Michael Byrd, a Capitol Police officer for 28 years — was cleared of wrongdoing in two investigations.\n\nA video spread on YouTube and other platforms wrongly claimed Ashli Babbitt tried to stop an antifa false flag on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThis video spread widely anyway, racking up 200,000 views on YouTube and tens of thousands more on the alternative platforms like Rumble and Bitchute.

They are for entertainment purposes only and are probably wrong.""\n\nMany of his claims in the nearly 10-minute video were, as promised, wrong:\n\nHe called the attack a ""false flag hoax."" It wasn’t. It was an effort to flip an election that left several people dead, more than 140 officers injured, and $1.5 million in property damage.\n\nHe insisted that a man named Ray Epps instigated the siege as one of several ""FBI assets."" That’s not true. There is no evidence that the FBI orchestrated the attack, and Epps, a former Oath Keeper seen near the Capitol on videos, told the House committee investigating the attack that he has no ties to the FBI or law enforcement.\n\nHe said that the rioters who supported Trump were sentenced to 40 years in prison for ""staying in between the velvet lines."" That’s false. Claims that Jan. 6 was a ""normal tourist visit"" are Pants on Fire, and the longest sentence handed down to date was for 63 months.\n\nNo documented antifa presence\n\nThroughout his video, the Salty Cracker claimed that Babbitt was trying to stop antifa activists in disguise ""who were breaking into the f------ Speaker’s Lobby over here, and then got shot.""\n\nHere’s how he described what happened before her death:\n\n""All of the Trump supporters (were) trying to stop these people from breaking windows, trying to stop these people from setting the place on fire.

Was Babbitt trying to fend those rioters off?\n\nThroughout his video, the Salty Cracker read from an article in the Epoch Times, a pro-Trump outlet, with the headline: ""Babbitt tried to stop attack on Capitol Speaker’s Lobby, video shows.""\n\nThe article largely ignored the actions that prompted Babbitt’s fatal shooting, when she tried to push through the window to the Speaker’s Lobby. In an interview after the riot, Baranyi said the police were warning her to stop, but that ""she didn’t heed the call.""\n\nThe article instead focused on the buildup to that moment, claiming that the footage captured by those who were there, when slowed down, showed Babbitt trying ""to prevent the attack, not join it."" Some of that footage came from John Sullivan, an activist controversial on both sides of the political spectrum, whose presence fueled the antifa falsehood, and who faces several charges.\n\nThe Epoch Times’ evidence for its assertion: that Babbitt had ""looks of shock and concern"" on her face; that she was ""so distressed at the violence, she jumped up and down in frustration""; that she ""confronted"" Alam before he punched the window she later climbed through; that she winced at his punch; that and she at one point shouted, ""Stop! No! Don’t! Wait!""\n\nThose claims are speculative and unsubstantiated. Videos of the incident do not clearly capture all that Babbitt was saying and doing, let alone feeling, at the time.\n\nWhether Babbitt was feeling shocked and concerned, and whether she was jumping because she was frustrated, is also a matter of interpretation.\n\nOther footage from Tayler Hansen, a self-described ""independent journalist"" whose Twitter account includes statements of support for conservative causes, shows Babbitt leaning toward Alam and appearing to say something. But it’s not clear that she was confronting him.\n\nExperts in multimedia forensics told PolitiFact it’s nearly impossible to discern from Sullivan’s video what Babbitt was saying. She’s far away from Sullivan’s microphone in a loud room with many people shouting, making it difficult to attribute speech directly to her.\n\n""This is a classic ‘cocktail party effect’ recording of an unknown number of speakers, overlapped, speaking loud,"" said Catalin Grigoras, director of the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado, Denver. Grigoras and other experts said the science available to experts would likely be unable to isolate Babbitt’s voice from Sullivan’s video.\n\nOne rioter recalled for investigators that Babbitt said something along the lines of, ""Just open the door. They’re not gonna stop."" And another video recorded by Hansen showed Babbitt shouting at the officers. (It’s not clear what Babbitt is saying in that clip, either, experts said.)\n\nTrump supporters try to break through a police barrier on Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington. (AP)\n\nThe Epoch Times article also quoted from Hansen and Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt.\n\nHansen told the Epoch Times that Babbitt was ""literally trapped"" in a corner. Aaron Babbitt said she climbed through the window because she feared for her life and wanted to escape.\n\nBut Hansen’s video shows that Babbitt was the first to reach the doors leading to the Speaker’s Lobby. Footage shows her not pinned but moving freely prior to the incident..\n\nOur ruling\n\nA YouTube video claimed, ""Ashli Babbitt tried to stop antifa false flag on Jan. 6.""\n\nThe video was posted by a creator whose website includes a disclaimer saying his opinions are meant ""for entertainment purposes only and are probably wrong.""\n\nIn this case, the video’s central claim that Babbitt was fighting to thwart an antifa false flag is a ridiculous rewriting of what happened inside the Capitol. Babbitt was shot as she attempted to climb through the shattered window of a door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby.\n\nThere was no documented trace of antifa involvement at the Capitol or in her shooting, and the suggestion that Babbitt was trying to stop the mob’s advances was based largely on speculation about what she was doing, saying and feeling in the moments leading up to her death.\n\nWe rate this YouTube video Pants on Fire!'}}",86.0,1

Bowers said it ran counter to his oath to the Constitution and that he would “never do anything of such magnitude without deep consultation with qualified attorneys.”\n\n“It is a tenet of my faith that the Constitution is divinely inspired. My most basic foundational beliefs,” he went on to say. “So for me to do that because somebody just asked me to, is foreign to my very being. I will not do it.”\n\nBowers said that when he met with Trump attorneys Jenna Ellis and Rudy Giuliani, he pressed them for names of people they claimed had voted illegally in Arizona, but they never had any evidence, just “lots of theories.”\n\nTuesday’s focus reviewed how Trump was repeatedly told his pressure campaign could potentially cause violence against the local officials and their families but pursued it anyway, according to a committee aide.\n\nAnd it underscored that fallout from Trump’s lies continues, with election officers facing ongoing public harassment and political challengers trying to take over their jobs.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/21/us/jan-6-hearing-trump/rusty-bowers-arizona-trump-jan-6', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Hearings Day 4: Panel Ties Trump to False Electors Plan - The ...', 'Snippet': 'An aide to Senator Ron Johnson tried to arrange for the senator to provide fake electors from Michigan and Wisconsin to Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021. ... of Arizona’s electors for ...', 'Full_text': 'The hearing demonstrated the human costs of the waves of threats and intimidation set off by Mr. Trump and his supporters as they pressured state officials and election workers to find a way to deprive Joseph R. Biden Jr. of his victory.\n\nHere are four takeaways.\n\nTrump was directly involved in the ‘fake electors’ plan.\n\nThe committee showed evidence that Mr. Trump was directly involved behind the scenes in trying to put forward the alternate slates of Trump electors that he hoped could replace the electors awarded to Mr. Biden through his victories in swing states like Arizona and Georgia.\n\nMr. Trump called Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, to ask her to talk to one of his outside lawyers, John Eastman, who was on the line, about the plan, Ms. McDaniel said in a video clip of her deposition to the committee. Mr. Trump wanted Ms. McDaniel, she said, to talk to Mr. Eastman “about the importance of the R.N.C. helping the campaign gather these contingent electors” if Mr. Trump’s legal challenges were successful.\n\nAs Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman were undertaking the scheme, the White House Counsel’s Office held a meeting with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani; the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and other aides, where they were told that the plan was not legally sound, according to recorded testimony from a West Wing aide, Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nThe committee did not say whether Mr. Trump was told about the meeting with the White House Counsel’s Office. Last week, the panel revealed that Mr. Trump had been told by Mr. Eastman that the broader effort they were pursuing to convince Vice President Mike Pence to block or delay certification of the Electoral College count in Mr. Biden’s favor had no legal basis — a fact that legal experts say could help prosecutors build a criminal case against Mr. Trump.\n\nG.O.P. elected officials pushed the electors scheme.\n\nThe committee showed that Republicans in Congress were pushing the alternate electors plan even on Jan. 6, hours before the day’s violence, which had the effect of stopping the certification of the electoral count as Mr. Pence was whisked away from the mob.\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, told an aide for Mr. Pence on Jan. 6 that Mr. Johnson wanted to give Mr. Pence a list of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, two states won by Mr. Biden.\n\n“Johnson needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise,” Sean Riley, an aide to Mr. Johnson, texted an aide to Mr. Pence, according to messages released by the committee.\n\n“What is it?” Chris Hodgson, the aide to Mr. Pence, replied.\n\n“Alternate slate of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Mr. Riley said.\n\n“Do not give that to him,” Mr. Hodgson texted back.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Johnson, Alexa Henning, said on Twitter that he “had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office.”\n\nThe communications with the vice president’s office, she said, were “staff to staff” and the documents were never sent to Mr. Pence.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, another Trump ally on Capitol Hill, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, reached out to Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and a Republican, to see if he would support the decertification of Arizona’s electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Mr. Bowers recounted telling Mr. Biggs.\n\nTrump’s allies could not produce evidence of election fraud.\n\nThe committee showed examples of how Mr. Trump and his allies knew that there was no evidence that the election had been stolen.\n\nMr. Bowers recounted how Mr. Giuliani acknowledged to him at one point in a phone call that they could not find the evidence of fraud that they needed.\n\n“He said, ‘We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence,’” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani telling him. “And I don’t know if that was a gaffe or maybe he didn’t think through what he said, but both myself and others in my group, the three in my group and my counsel, both remembered that specifically, and afterwards, we kind of laughed about it.”\n\nAt another point, Mr. Eastman was pressing Mr. Bowers to embrace the plan to push a slate of Trump electors from Arizona despite the state’s certification of Mr. Biden’s victory there. Mr. Bowers said that he questioned how he could legally participate in the scheme and that Mr. Eastman responded by saying, “Just do it and let the courts sort it out.”\n\nThreats and intimidation started well before Jan. 6.\n\nThe public pressure that Mr. Trump and his allies put on state election officials resulted in the officials being targeted in frightening and intimidating ways by Trump supporters.\n\nShaye Moss, an elections worker in Fulton County, Ga., who, along with her mother, had been falsely accused by Mr. Giuliani of committing election fraud, provided a dramatic portrait of the harassment that Mr. Giuliani’s false claims had spawned. She described the racist messages she received on Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me, telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, ‘Be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Ms. Moss said.\n\nShe said that the entire episode, and the attention that came with it, had “turned my life upside down.”\n\n“I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” she said. “I don’t want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something. I don’t go to the grocery store at all. I haven’t been anywhere at all. I’ve gained about 60 pounds. I just don’t do nothing anymore. I don’t want to go anywhere.”\n\nShe said she loved her job as an election worker but ultimately quit.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, recounted how the home of his son’s widow had been broken into.\n\nMr. Bowers was the target of protests and threats as his daughter was dying. And he described how his office had received over 20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voice mail messages and texts that made it impossible for him and his staff to communicate.\n\n“It is the new pattern or a pattern in our lives to worry what will happen on Saturdays because we have various groups come by and they have had video panel trucks with videos of me proclaiming me to be a pedophile and a pervert and a corrupt politician and blaring loudspeakers in my neighborhood,” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nChris Cameron contributed reporting.\n\nNeither Mr. Holder nor the committee has disclosed the contents of the full trove of videos, and neither has commented on whether it provides substantial new information about Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss.\n\nBut the small piece of it seen by The Times was striking for how it shows Ms. Trump using a different tone in describing her father’s efforts to overturn the outcome than she did in the portion of her deposition to the House committee that has been made public so far.\n\nThe interview for the documentary was conducted on Dec. 10, 2020, the person with access to the video said. That was nine days after a public statement by Attorney General William P. Barr, who declared at the time that there was no widespread fraud impacting the election’s outcome, a rare public rebuke of Mr. Trump’s claims at the time.\n\nIn her recorded interview with the House committee, Ms. Trump said that Mr. Barr’s comments “affected my perspective.”\n\n“I respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he said,” she said. The committee may release additional video of her recorded testimony.\n\nPeople close to Ms. Trump have insisted that she had distanced herself from what was taking place around her father at that time. Those people have said that, after the race was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Trump began focusing on winding down her office and looking toward a new life in Miami.\n\nYet in the video with the filmmaker, Ms. Trump, describing her father’s gains in votes among key demographic groups, had a different reaction when asked whether she had a “take” on her father’s “very clear position on the results and what’s going on.”\n\n“I think that, as the president has said, every single vote needs to be counted and needs to be heard, and he campaigned for the voiceless,” Ms. Trump replied. “And I think a lot of Americans feel very, very disenfranchised right now, and really, question the sanctity of our elections, and that’s not right, it’s not acceptable.”\n\nShe went on, “And he has to take on this fight. Look, you fight for what you love the most and he loves this country and he loves this country’s people, and he wants to make sure that their voice is, is heard and not muted.”\n\nShe said that he “will continue to fight until every legal remedy is exhausted and that’s what he should do.”\n\nAn aide to Ms. Trump did not respond to a message about the new video.\n\nThe filmmaker was connected to Mr. Kushner by Jason Greenblatt, a former lawyer at the Trump Organization and then the White House envoy to the Middle East. The film was envisioned as a legacy project for Mr. Trump, according to two people familiar with how it came about.\n\nMr. Bowers, who spoke about the Constitution in reverential and spiritual terms, had tears in his eyes as he described his gravely ill daughter enduring some of the harassment outside their house. (She died in late January.)\n\n“It was disturbing,” he said. “It was disturbing.”\n\nThe effort to persuade him to take steps to flip the outcome in Arizona to Mr. Trump’s column — the state was won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. — began with pressure from Mr. Trump, and one of his lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who maintained that he had evidence of fraud. “Aren’t we all Republicans here? I would think we would get a better reception,” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani saying at one point.\n\nSoon after Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, certified the state for Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani and an associate, Jenna Ellis, met with Arizona lawmakers, including Mr. Bowers, Mr. Bowers recalled. Mr. Bowers described Ms. Ellis asserting that they had evidence of widespread voter fraud, only to provide none.\n\n“I said, ‘I want the names. Do you have the names of the supposedly dead or fraudulent voters?’” Mr. Bowers said. “She said, ‘Yes.’”\n\nNothing was produced. Eventually, he recalled, Mr. Giuliani said, “We’ve got lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”\n\nMr. Bowers also recalled speaking to Mr. Trump, making clear to the president that he “wouldn’t do anything illegal for him,” as one questioner, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said. Nonetheless, another lawyer advising Mr. Trump, John Eastman, called Mr. Bowers in early January and urged him to schedule a legislative vote to “decertify the electors, because we had plenary authority to do so.”\n\nMr. Eastman, Mr. Bowers testified, said that he should “just do it and let the courts figure it all out.”\n\nMr. Bowers again rejected the push, saying, “I took an oath — for me to take that, to do what you do would be counter to my oath.”\n\nFinally, he testified, there was a call from another Trump supporter, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, when the Electoral College vote was to be confirmed by a joint session of Congress. Mr. Biggs, he said, pushed him again to undo the state’s certification of its electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“We have no legal pathway” to “execute such a request,” Mr. Bowers recalled saying. He also recalled his reaction when he learned that Trump advisers pushed ahead with a scheme to put forward slates of “alternate” electors. “I thought of the book, ‘The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,’” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nMr. Bowers’s personal journal contained an entry in which he said, “I do not want to be a winner by cheating. I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” He was invited to read it into the testimony.\n\nHe was also asked for his reaction to a statement from Mr. Trump criticizing Mr. Bowers’s testimony in advance, in which he claimed that Mr. Bowers had told him the election was “rigged” and that he had won the state.\n\n“I did have a conversation with the president,” Mr. Bowers said. “That certainly isn’t it.”\n\nA moment later, more emphatically, he said, “Anywhere, anyone, any time has said that I said the election was rigged — that would not be true.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/07/what-are-fake-electors.html', 'Headline': 'How the Fake Electors Scheme Was Supposed to Work', 'Snippet': 'Testimony from the House Jan. 6 committee revealed that Eastman, one of Trump’s lead lawyers, told Pence directly in an Oval Office meeting, “I’m here to request that you reject the electors ...', 'Full_text': 'You may be hearing the phrase “fake electors scheme” a lot lately—in fact, just this week, 16 people in Michigan were charged with a slew of felonies because of it. The “scheme” has also been under investigation by the Department of Justice since last year. But what exactly is it?\n\nIt’s a plan allegedly devised by Donald Trump, his lawyers, and his advisers to overturn the 2020 election results and keep Trump in the White House for another term, despite Joe Biden winning the general election.\n\nThe details are a bit convoluted. We’re here to fill you in.\n\nPart I: Seed Doubt\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2020 election, there were signs that Trump might not accept an election loss. When asked, Trump wouldn’t commit to a peaceful transfer of power. Instead, he seeded doubt in the integrity of the U.S. voting system, specifically mail-in ballots. “I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster. Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very peaceful—there won’t be a transfer, frankly, there’ll be a continuation,” said Trump. Around that time, a group of bipartisan experts had produced a white paper laying out scenarios of how Trump could react to an election loss, predicting a constitutional crisis. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also warned the country of a “nightmare scenario” where Trump refused to step down from the presidency despite losing the election.\n\nSure enough, as it became clear in the days and weeks following the Nov. 3, 2020, election that Biden was going to become the next U.S. president, Trump’s camp began to target seven battleground states—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—where Biden had won. According to evidence presented during the House Jan. 6 committee hearings, Trump adviser Kenneth Chesebro was the one to initially suggest this plan, and he pulled in attorneys John Eastman, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and other Trump allies like chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn to help execute it.\n\nPart II: Lawsuits and Demands for Recounts\n\nTrump and his allies launched 62 legal challenges in battleground states. But 61 failed; one Pennsylvania judge ruled that voters couldn’t go back and “cure” their ballots, if they had failed to provide proper identification, within three days after the election. The decision didn’t change Biden’s victory in Pennsylvania.\n\nUndeterred, the Trump camp asked for the support of local Republican officials, who are in charge of facilitating their local elections. Trump infamously called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and demanded he “find 11,780 votes,” the exact number needed to win over Biden. Trump also personally contacted the speaker of the Pennsylvania House, Bryan Cutler, to request his help in reversing his state’s election results.\n\nGiuliani also addressed the Georgia Legislature in an attempt to convince them that Georgia’s election results had been skewed by fraud. Meadows traveled to Georgia to watch an audit of absentee ballots and sent the Department of Justice multiple emails alleging voter fraud and requesting investigations be started.\n\nPart III: Assemble Electors\n\nBefore an election, political parties in each state choose their electors—the people who will represent them in the Electoral College, should their candidate win. Most states award all of their electors to the party that earns the most votes, except for Nebraska and Maine, which send a proportional distribution of electors from both parties.\n\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, all the electors gather in their respective states to officially enter their votes for president. They record the vote on an official certificate, called the Certificate of Ascertainment, which they send to Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Constitution does not actually require electors to vote according to their state’s popular vote, but since the winning party got to choose them in advance, it’s pretty rare for them not to. Some states have also passed laws that penalize “faithless electors.”\n\nThis process usually runs smoothly, but there have been instances of trouble.\n\nIn 1960, when Sen. John F. Kennedy was running against Vice President Richard Nixon, the race was so tight that the Kennedy campaign demanded a recount in Hawaii, despite Nixon winning the state. As the recount took place, both campaigns organized their chosen slates of electors and sent signed certificates to Congress. Once the recount finished, Hawaii flipped for Kennedy, which then sent a second round of official electors and a new certificate to Washington, D.C.\n\nAs vice president, Nixon was also president of the Senate, and faced three different slates of electors, but chose to honor Kennedy’s.\n\nThe Trump campaign argued this set a precedent for them to object to states’ election results and put forth their own slates of electors. Though their excuse for doing so—the claims of voter fraud—had been widely disproven, the Trump campaign allegedly played a hand in assembling a hodgepodge of local Republicans in each of the seven battleground states to serve as fake electors.\n\nRepublican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel testified before the Jan. 6 Commission that Trump called her asking for the RNC’s help in gathering pro-Trump electors across the country. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers also said Trump pressured him to reconvene the Arizona Legislature and recall electors who were going to vote for Biden (Bowers refused).\n\nAt the time, however, the government’s top cybersecurity agency refuted Trump’s allegations of widespread voter fraud. And Trump’s own attorney general, Bill Barr, rejected the claims as “bullshit.” A Department of Justice investigation completed in 2022 also ultimately found no evidence of fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election.\n\nEven states that were more forgiving to Trump could not stand by his claims. The state of Georgia went through three rounds of recounts and Biden remained the clear winner every time. The same goes for Arizona, which held a hand recount of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County and found Biden actually gained 99 more votes.\n\nAlthough many Republican officials across all seven states refused to bend to Trump’s demands, Trump supporters in all seven battleground states, who had no authority to act as state electors, still signed fake certificates declaring Trump as their state’s winner and sent them to the National Archives.\n\nPart IV: Convince the Vice President\n\nAll of these efforts would be futile unless the vice president would play along. On Jan. 6, 2021, Mike Pence, in his capacity as president of the Senate, was scheduled to preside over the receiving and counting of electoral ballots. It’s mostly a ceremonial role, but Trump and his allies were convinced Pence had the authority to throw out the legitimate electoral votes for Biden and only count Trump’s fake ones, though the law does not explicitly grant him that authority.\n\nThe pressure campaign culminated in the days before the attack on the Capitol. Testimony from the House Jan. 6 committee revealed that Eastman, one of Trump’s lead lawyers, told Pence directly in an Oval Office meeting, “I’m here to request that you reject the electors.”\n\nPence did not oblige Eastman’s request, and days later, on Jan. 6, an angry mob of Trump supporters chanted “Hang Mike Pence.” Trump allegedly said the vice president “deserves it.”\n\nIn the end, the fake electors were not considered in Congress—despite an aide for Republican Sen. Ron Johnson attempting to hand them to Pence minutes before the electoral vote count started—and soon enough the world learned of Trump’s plan.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nAmerican Oversight, a progressive watchdog group, reported on this plan in March 2021 when, through a records request, they got their hands on copies of phony electoral vote certificates from the seven battleground states. Almost a year later, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow also revealed the scheme on her show.\n\nThen came the House Jan. 6 committee, which, through a series of public hearings, revealed some pretty shocking details. For example, when Bowers, Arizona’s governor, testified, he alleged that Republican Rep. Andy Biggs called him the morning of Jan. 6 to try to convince him to sign on to a fake slate of electors, a request he refused.\n\nThe committee voted to refer Trump to the DOJ on at least four criminal charges, handing over all of its evidence and transcripts. That’s when the department decided to appoint special counsel Jack Smith to investigate whether any person or entity unlawfully interfered with the transfer of power following the 2020 election or the Electoral College vote certification. And now that Trump has received a target letter in the investigation, it seems another indictment is going to come any day now.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/youre-one-arizonas-fake-electors-132532224.html', 'Headline': ""If you're one of Arizona's fake electors, Monday could be a no ... - Yahoo"", 'Snippet': 'Meanwhile in Wisconsin, 10 fake electors settled a civil l awsuit this week, admitting their actions were part of a scheme to overturn Biden’s victory.

He also agreed to turn over all emails and text messages to prosecutors.\n\nNow he’s apparently coming clean about his part in the conspiracy elsewhere.\n\nHis testimony could be key in Arizona\n\nNevada is the third state to bring criminal charges against its fake electors, following Michigan and Georgia. Chesebro is listed as a witness in the indictments.\n\nAnd Arizona?\n\nThe Post reports he’ll be here on Monday.\n\n“My client, Kenneth Chesebro, will travel anywhere in the United States to tell the truth about what happened leading up to the events of Jan. 6, 2021,” Robert Langford, his Nevada attorney, told the Post last week.\n\nChesebro’s testimony could be be key.\n\nAccording to his Fulton County, Ga., indictment, one of Chesebro’s memos “provides detailed, state-specific instructions for how Trump presidential elector nominees in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin would meet and cast electoral votes” for Trump, even though he lost the election in those states.\n\nThose memos “evolved over time from a legal strategy to preserve (Trump’s) rights to a corrupt plan to subvert the federal government function by stopping Biden electors’ votes from being counted and certified.”\n\nHow did that 'corrupt plan' evolve here?\n\nI, for one, would love to know how that evolution played out here in Arizona.\n\nSpecifically, how Arizona’s 11 Trump electors came to be meeting at state Republican Party headquarters on Dec. 14, 2020, signing documents falsely claiming to be “duly elected and qualified” to cast Arizona’s electoral votes for the guy who didn’t win.\n\nHow these “patriots” — including two who are now state senators (Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern), the now-former chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party (Kelli Ward) and a top executive with Turning Point USA (Tyler Bowyer) — came up with the same wild idea that just coincidentally occurred to Republicans in six other swing states won by Biden.\n\nOr how, even as those phonies were meeting in Phoenix to cast their non-existent votes for Trump, across town a group of Republican legislators were signing a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and Congress urging them to accept Arizona’s “alternate” electoral votes.\n\nIn all, 29 incoming and outgoing Republican legislators signed the request, calling it “A Joint Resolution of the 54th Legislature” and attaching the state seal so it would look official.\n\nThe plot involved more than 11 fake electors\n\nI’d also be curious how then-Rep. Mark Finchem, one of the state’s loudest stop the stealers, came to be hand carrying the lawmakers’ request to Washington on Jan. 5, 2021, putting it into the hands of one of Trump’s strongest acolytes on Capitol Hill, Rep. Andy Biggs.\n\nOr how Biggs came to be videoconferencing with Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, asking him to sign onto the legislators’ request and support the decertification of Arizona’s vote.\n\nBowers declined.\n\nBiggs went forth anyway, joining with Reps. Paul Gosar, Debbie Lesko and more than 140 esteemed members of Congress to reject Arizona’s vote.\n\nYou begin to understand those reports that Biggs sought a presidential pardon, though he denies it.\n\nArizona’s fake electors have mostly laid low since details of this scam on America have trickled out. Their enablers and supporters insist they were merely a backup plan, casting Arizona’s electoral votes for Trump in the event that lawsuits challenging the election were successful.\n\nFake electors, beware: A Trump ally is ready to come clean\n\nThat might actually work if we were in Pennsylvania or New Mexico, where the Trump electors added that caveat to the official certifications they sent to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nIn New Mexico, the Trump electors signed, “on the understanding that it might later be determined that [they] are the duly elected and qualified Electors.”\n\nIn Pennsylvania, they said their votes for Trump should count only “if, as a result of a final non-appealable court order or other proceeding prescribed by law, we are ultimately recognized as being the duly elected and qualified electors.”\n\nMayes should broaden her investigation\n\nBut Arizona’s fake electors offered no such hedge. They signed documents simply declaring themselves “duly elected and qualified electors” and casting their votes for the guy who didn’t win.\n\nMe? I’m hoping Mayes will broaden her investigation to look beyond the 11 “electors” who so proudly put their name to a fake document.\n\nThis wasn’t just 11 rubes who decided on a whim to protest Biden’s win by casting a symbolic electoral vote for Trump.\n\nThis was a carefully planned scheme, meticulously coordinated — from the seeds of doubt deeply planted to erode trust in our elections to the fake electors who were part of a plot to steal the vote in Arizona and other swing states to the storming of the nation’s Capitol to stop Joe Biden from becoming president.\n\nI’m guessing Kenneth Chesebro knows exactly what happened here, and on Monday he’ll be in Phoenix.\n\nThat thump you just heard? I picture Arizona’s fake electors dropping into a dead faint.\n\nReach Roberts at laurie.roberts@arizonarepublic.com.

David Farnsworth was leading with 64% of the vote to Bowers\' 36% as of Wednesday morning, according to the Arizona secretary of state\'s office. Trump supported Farnsworth in the race, and blasted Bowers as a ""RINO coward"" at a rally last month.\n\nBowers testified on June 21 before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The hearing focused on a plan by Trump\'s allies to put forward alternate electors that supported Trump in seven battleground states in the 2020 election that President Biden won, including Arizona.\n\nBowers resisted that effort, telling the committee that the scheme to replace Mr. Biden\'s electors with a fake slate for Trump was a ""tragic parody.""\n\nEarlier this year, Bowers helped block a bill to empower the legislature to choose its own electors, regardless of how the people voted.\n\nBowers has been a Republican for 30 years. But ahead of a visit by Trump to Arizona in July, the state Republican Party voted to censure him. Kelli Ward, chair of the Arizona GOP, announced the condemnation by the panel on Twitter, saying Bowers is ""no longer a Republican in good standing & we call on Republicans to replace him at the ballot box in the August primary.""\n\nIn an interview ahead of Tuesday\'s primary, Bowers\' told CBS News\' Ed O\'Keefe said he had heard from people who called the censure ahead of a visit by Trump ""cheap theatrics.""

Andy Biggs urged Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers to throw out Biden electors and replace them with Trump electors on the morning of January 6. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images)', 'Full_text': 'The latest hearing before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection revealed new details Tuesday about how former President Donald Trump pressured state officials to help him overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe panel featured testimony from three Republican officials who were all on the receiving end of Trump’s outreach after the election: Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, his deputy Gabe Sterling and Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers.\n\nLike previous hearings, these officials testified about their unwillingness to participate in legally dubious schemes that would undermine the election, including efforts to subvert the Electoral College with fake pro-Trump electors.\n\nThe panel’s next hearing is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET on Thursday and will focus on Trump’s attempt to use the Justice Department to back his election disinformation.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Tuesday’s hearing:\n\nRepublican witnesses tie Trump directly to fake electors effort\n\nMultiple witnesses told the committee that Trump was personally involved in the effort to put forward slates of fake electors in key battleground states — a key part of the broader effort to overturn Biden’s legitimate election victory.\n\nCNN has previously reported on the role that key Trump allies, including his former attorney Rudy Giuliani, played in overseeing the effort but witnesses revealed new details Tuesday about how the former President himself was not only aware of the push, but seemingly endorsed it.\n\nBowers told the committee that he received a call from Trump and Giuliani during which they urged him to go along with a plan to put forward illegitimate, pro-Trump electors from the state.\n\n“I told them I did not want to be used as a pawn,” Bowers said on Tuesday, recalling what he told Giuliani and Trump on the Nov. 22, 2020 phone call.\n\nCommittee reveals new details about how congressional Republicans helped Trump’s efforts to overturn election\n\nTuesday’s hearing featured new details about two congressional Republicans played a role in Trump’s sprawling efforts to try to overturn his 2020 election loss. The first was Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who called Bowers on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, asking him to support decertification of his state’s electors for Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Bowers testified on Tuesday.\n\nThe second occurred several hours later, minutes before then-Vice President Mike Pence gaveled in the joint session of Congress to certify the electoral votes. According to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin asked an aide to Pence how Johnson could hand-deliver him the fake slates of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, which had not been sent to the National Archives. Pence’s aide responded that Johnson should “not give that to him.”\n\nBoth the effort to decertify Biden electors and put forward fake Trump electors were part of the Trump team’s scheme to stop the congressional certification of the election on Jan. 6. The role that Trump’s allies in Congress played have been of interest of interest to the committee, which has subpoenaed five House GOP members, including Biggs and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWitnesses describe how Trump’s lies had serious consequences — including threats\n\nThe committee’s hearing underscored how the lies about the election spread by Trump and his team spiraled into multi-faceted disasters for the state officials forced to grapple with them.\n\nAll of the witnesses who appeared at Tuesday’s hearing talked about the serious repercussions they faced as a result of the false claims that Trump and his team put forward. That included pressure to help in the effort to overturn the election, the repeated attempts to try to debunk the claims and the threats they faced from pro-Trump supporters for refusing to go along with Trump’s efforts.\n\nBowers delivered emotional testimony about “disturbing” protests outside his home. He got emotional as he discussed the impact protests at this house had on his wife and his daughter, who was at home gravely ill at the time and was “upset by what was happening outside.” He also read passages from his personal journal about friends who had turned on him.\n\nRaffensperger described the attacks that his wife faced after the election, which he said he suspected was an attempt to pressure him to quit. Schiff cited Raffensperger’s book, in which he wrote, “I felt then and still believe today that this was a threat.”\n\nRepublican officials take the lead testifying against Trump\n\nYet again, the Democratic-run January 6 committee turned to Republican officials to make their case against Trump. In fact, the majority of the in-person witnesses so far have been Republicans.\n\nTuesday’s hearing featured in-person testimony from three conservative Republicans who endorsed Trump in 2020. The committee also played deposition clips from two other GOP officials: Michigan State Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and Pennsylvania House Speaker Bryan Cutler.\n\nThey all provided damning testimony against Trump, describing how he repeatedly tried to twist their arms and cajole them to overturn the results. They also described the threats and pressure they faced from Trump supporters who believed his election lies and protested outside their homes and offices and bombarded them with calls and text messages.\n\nTop Arizona Republican refutes Trump in real-time\n\nBowers said under oath Tuesday that Trump lied about him in a press release that came out shortly before the hearing started, where Trump claimed Bowers told him in November 2020 that he believed the election was rigged.\n\nIn the statement, Trump attacked Bowers and described a call they had after the election, claiming, “during the conversation, he told me that the election was rigged and that I won Arizona.” Trump added, “Bowers should hope there’s not a tape of the conversation.”\n\nUnder questioning from Schiff, Bowers confirmed that he “did have a conversation with the president, but that certainly isn’t it.”\n\nEmotional testimony highlights victims of Trump’s disinformation\n\nLater in the day, the committee heard from Wandrea “Shaye” Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, who were election workers in Atlanta during the 2020 election. Trump, Giuliani and other GOP figures put them both at the center of their unhinged lies about massive voter fraud in Georgia.\n\nCoverage of Trump’s presidency often focused on his words and lies. But the emotional and deeply personal testimony from Moss and Freeman flipped the script and showed the human toll of Trump’s lies.\n\nThey described in devastating terms how Trump’s lies essentially destroyed their lives.\n\nMoss said she felt “helpless” and stopped giving out her business card because “I don’t want anyone knowing my name.” Her mother said she gets “nervous when I have to give food orders” because someone who believes Trump’s lies might recognize her name. She said she felt “homeless” while she lived in hiding for two months after the FBI told her she wasn’t safe at home.\n\n“I have lost my sense of security, all because of a group of people, starting with (Trump) and his ally Rudy Giuliani, decided to scapegoat me, and my daughter, Shaye, to push lies about how the election was stolen,” Freeman said in a videotaped deposition, a clip of which was played during Tuesday’s hearing.\n\nGOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee, made a public appeal for testimony from former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone at the end of Tuesday’s hearing.\n\nThe request raises a new tension behind the scenes, where the House is still seeking testimony from one of the most significant advisers to former President Donald Trump in the last days of his White House.\n\nCheney noted that upcoming hearings will shed light on Cipollone and others in his office doing “what was right,” as they tried to stop some Trump’s movements leading up to Jan. 6, 2021. Others who sided with Cipollone and against Trump at crucial moments, including former top Justice Department officials, have already spoken with the committee and had clips of their depositions used in hearings so far.\n\nNearly every person in Trump’s innermost circle in the White House, including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, sat for questioning in the House. Cippoline has met informally with the committee, but clips of any closed-door interview with Cipollone have not been shown in any of the hearings so far.\n\nCNN reported last week that Cipollone was not expected to appear. One other inner circle White House adviser, Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff, has refused to testify.\n\nTestimony from Cipollone would be especially notable because his predecessor in the Trump White House, Donald McGahn, resisted testifying in a congressional probe about the Russia investigation for years. The Trump administration claimed the former White House counsel had absolute immunity — a position the Biden administration rolled back, leaving McGahn to testify about Trump to Congress last year.\n\nThe Biden administration has not used broad claims of executive privilege to protect large amounts of testimony from the Jan. 6 committee, though Trump has repeatedly said he believes some of his conversations with top advisers should be kept confidential.\n\n“Our committee is certain that Mr. Trump does not want Mr. Cipollone to testify here,” Cheney said.\n\nCheney spoke to reporters in the hallway after Thursday’s hearings, telling them that the committee will “continue to reach out” to Cipollone.\n\nAsked by CNN’s Manu Raju if Tuesday’s hearing showed any criminal behavior by Trump, Cheney said: “I think that you’ve seen throughout the hearings that we are putting forward very clearly a number of instances in which there are serious questions about the actions of the former President. We’ll continue to do so.”\n\nAccording to a person familiar with the matter, Cipollone has resisted providing public testimony, believing that he has sufficiently cooperated with the committee by sitting for a closed-door interview along with his deputy Pat Philbin,\n\nThe Biden White House cleared Cipollone and Philbin’s private interview after weeks of discussions that navigated the sensitive issues raised by having a White House counsel, one of the closest advisers to a president, sit down with the committee.\n\nTrump has not raised objections to Cipollone and Philbin talking to the committee despite claiming executive privilege claims over other testimony and documents, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.\n\nThe prospect of having Cipollone appear at a public hearing harkens back to John Dean and the Nixon era, an uncomfortable prospect for Cipollone who has long sought to keep a low profile.\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju and Morgan Rimmer contributed reporting to this post.\n\nA video produced by the House Select Committee detailed former President Donald Trump and his team’s efforts to sway election officials and intimidate election workers following President Biden’s 2020 election win.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the details the committee laid out:\n\nProtests outside officials’ homes: In a video played by the committee, protesters stood outside the home of Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson calling her a “tyrant and a felon,” as she was putting her child to sleep. She described to the committee, via audio recording, her fear for her family’s safety.\n\nPersonal phone numbers posted online: In late November 2020, Trump invited delegations from Michigan and Pennsylvania to the White House. After Michigan State Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Republican, told Trump that he would not break the law to keep Trump in office, he said Trump posted Shirkey’s personal phone number for his millions of followers on Facebook, urging them to contact him and demand he decertify Michigan’s election results. Shirkey said he received “just shy of 4,000 text messages over the short period of time, calling to take action.”\n\nDaily phone calls: Following his refusal to contest his state’s election results, Pennsylvania House Speaker Brian Cutler said he received daily phone calls from former Trump lawyer’s Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Lewis asking to discuss the election. Cutler said he asked his lawyers to tell the pair to stop calling, saying their efforts were inappropriate: they did not stop. One month later, long-time Trump ally Steve Bannon announced a protest against Cutler at his home and offices. Cutler said his then-15-year-old son was home alone when the first protest happened. He said that his personal information was leaked online and received so many calls to his home phone, that he had to disconnect it because messages were filling up so fast at all hours of the night. The select committee showed an anonymous voice mail Cutler received saying that the caller was outside his home.\n\nMillions of dollars in ads: According to the committee, the Trump campaign spent millions of dollars on ads pushing election fraud claims and urging Americans to call their legislators and demand they inspect voting machines.\n\n“20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voicemails and texts”: Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers described to the committee the harassment he and his family faced after refusing to decertify his state’s election results. Bowers said he and his team received “20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voicemails and texts.” At home, Bowers’ Saturdays were filled with protests by various groups disrupting the neighborhood with trucks playing videos claiming he was a pedophile and pervert. He recalled a confrontation between a protester with a gun who was vocally threatening his neighbor. Bowers detailed his family’s strength during this time, especially that of his wife and then “gravely-ill” daughter.\n\nDeath threats and a home break in: The committee played excerpts of a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call obtained by CNN between Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Trump where the former President urged Raffensperger to “find” votes to overturn the election. Raffensperger refused, claiming Georgia’s election results were accurate. Following this conversation, he said both he and his wife were doxed and received death threats, he told the committee. Additionally, he said his widowed daughter-in-law’s home was broken into while she was alone with her two young children.\n\n“I’ve lost my name, I’ve lost my reputation, I’ve lost my sense of security”: Former Fulton County, Georgia, election workers Wandrea “Shaye” Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman were specifically targeted by Trump’s team to push false allegations of voter fraud. The pair worked the 2020 presidential election and were named 18 times by Trump in the call made to Raffensperger. In that call, Trump called Freeman a “professional vote scammer and a hustler.” Moss detailed the harassment her grandmother faced as well, including a home invasion where people were looking for Moss and Freeman, claiming to be making a citizen’s arrest. In a video testimony to the committee, Freeman said, “I’ve lost my name, I’ve lost my reputation, I’ve lost my sense of security.” Prior to Jan. 6, the FBI advised Freeman to leave her home for safety — she was gone for two months.\n\nThe House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, just wrapped up its fourth hearing of the month.\n\nThe panel heard live testimony from several Georgia election officials about former President Trump’s efforts to try to pressure state officials to overturn the 2020 election, incorrectly claiming there was voter fraud.\n\nThe witnesses testified about the details of their conversations with the former President. They also said they experienced threats and harassment as a result of Trump’s lies. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his chief operating officer Gabe Sterling and former Fulton County, Georgia, election worker Wandrea “Shaye” Moss were on the panels.\n\nRaffensperger emerged as a national figure in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Trump urged Georgia’s chief elections officer to “find” enough votes to overturn the state’s election results.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had already spoken privately with the Jan. 6 committee about his experience in addition to testifying before the special grand jury in the criminal probe into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the Peach State.\n\nHere’s what the officials told the Jan. 6 committee:\n\nBrad Raffensperger: Raffensperger said he and his team investigated “every single allegation” of election fraud from former President Trump — and they came up with nothing indicating any fraud whatsoever.\n\nHe said in the face of threats and harassment to him and his family, he didn’t walk away because he knew his office had followed the law. “I think sometimes, moments require you to stand up and just take the shots,” he said. “We followed the law and we followed the Constitution, and at the end of the day, President Trump came up short.”\n\nRaffensperger said the numbers don’t lie, explaining to the committee how the ballots were checked three separate times, all with very close accuracy. “Every allegation we checked. We ran down the rabbit trail to make sure our numbers were accurate,” he said.\n\nGabe Sterling: Sterling described the misinformation and threats that were being directed at workers in the days after the election. During testimony, he recalled the moment he “lost it” when he found out an election contractor working for Dominion Systems was receiving death threats “that had been posted by some QAnon supporters.” After that, he started trying to combat misinformation at news conferences and said that he even argued with some family members about false claims of election fraud.\n\nHe said the job of the secretary of state’s office is to continue to combat that feeling and “get the facts out, do our job, tell the truth, follow the Constitution, follow the law and defend the institutions… and the institutions held.”\n\nWandrea “Shaye” Moss: Moss was accused by Trump and others of carrying out a fake ballot scheme in Fulton County, Georgia. She said she and her family received threats and Trump’s lies turned her life “upside down.” Moss told the committee about “hateful” and “racist” threats she received via Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me. Telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like ‘be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Moss said, adding that she loved her job and loved helping voters with any questions they had.\n\nThe committee also played video of recorded testimony from Moss’ mother, Ruby Freeman. She said she lost her “name and her reputation,” adding that she left her home for about two months ahead of Jan. 6, 2021, after the FBI told her it wouldn’t be safe. Freeman said agents told her she needed to stay away until “at least the inauguration.” She also testified that even today there is “nowhere” she feels safe.\n\nRead takeaways from today’s hearing here.\n\nThe head of the Republican Party testified to the House select committee that former President Donald Trump called her as part of an effort to use fake electors to support him.\n\nThe new detail links Trump directly to efforts to put forward rogue, alternate slates of electors in states that he lost, even though his top lawyers in the White House and the campaign knew the approach wasn’t legally sound.\n\nShe noted that the electors were being pulled together in case Trump legal challenges succeeded in blocking Biden wins.\n\nThe campaign wasn’t entirely on board, however.\n\nSome of the top officials in the Trump campaign and White House believed the fake electors plan wasn’t legal, and left the push to lawyers like Eastman and Rudy Giuliani who had swarmed after the election, the committee said.\n\nIn an interview with the committee, Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to the White House chief of staff, confirmed to the committee that lawyers with the White House counsel said the plot was not legally sound. She said former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani were involved in the meeting.\n\nTwo top campaign lawyers, Matt Morgan and Justin Clark, said in their taped depositions that they told Trump lawyers pushing the fake electors scheme they didn’t want to take part.\n\n“You just get after it. I’m out,” Clark told the House, about a conversation he had with another lawyer who backed the fake electors plan, Kenneth Chesebro. “I don’t think this is appropriate. This isn’t the right thing to do.”\n\nMorgan described directing another campaign official to tell Chesebro: “This is your task. You are responsible for the Electoral College issues moving forward. This was my way of taking that responsibility to zero.”\n\nBefore Tuesday, it wasn’t known that Clark had spoken to the House select committee.\n\nA source familiar with Clark’s testimony says he testified “a while back” and that Trump is likely not pleased his former lead campaign attorney is shown saying essentially his campaign didn’t have a case to back up Trump’s lies.\n\nClark still works with Trump. Last year he directed witnesses the House had subpoenaed to preserve executive privilege, and he represented Trump in his unsuccessful appeal to try to stop the release of White House documents from the National Archives.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol turns its attention Tuesday to the campaign to pressure state-level officials to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nThe hearing will focus in particular on then-President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results in Arizona and in Georgia — where Trump infamously asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” the votes he needed to win.\n\nCommittee aides said the witnesses testifying in person on Tuesday from Arizona and Georgia will be able to speak to the pressure campaign that came from the White House, as well as the backlash they received from Trump’s supporters.\n\nThe witnesses from Georgia include Raffensperger and his chief operating officer, Gabe Sterling, both of whom faced relentless attacks from Trump after certifying the state’s election. Fulton County election worker Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, who was falsely accused by Trump of ballot fraud, will also testify about the backlash she faced.\n\nArizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican, will testify about the pressure he received from Trump and Giuliani, according to committee aides.\n\nHere are key things to watch for during today’s hearing:\n\nThe Meadows connection: Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee member who will lead Tuesday’s hearing, told the Los Angeles Times on Monday that the hearing would show how Trump’s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had played an “intimate role” in the efforts to pressure Georgia state legislators and election officials.\n\nThe California Democrat said the committee would release new text messages showing that Meadows had wanted to send autographed “Make America Great Again” hats to those conducting Georgia’s post-election audit.\n\nCommittee aides said the hearing would “demonstrate his involvement” in Georgia in the run-up to Jan. 6.\n\nMeadows reached out multiple times to Raffensperger after the 2020 election, according to text messages obtained by CNN, and he participated in Trump’s January 2021 call where the former President asked Raffensperger to “find” the votes the then-President needed to win.\n\nWhile that call was going on, Meadows was texting with the deputy secretary of state, who urged him to end the call that now stands at the center of Fulton County’s investigation into whether any of the actions Trump or his allies took related to Georgia’s election were criminal.\n\nTestimony from those who faced backlash from Trump’s attacks: The witnesses will be able to testify firsthand on Tuesday about the impact of Trump’s pressure campaign and false claims about the election — as they all were subjected to attacks and threats.\n\nAides said that Bowers, the Arizona secretary of state, will be able to testify about the “campaign of harassment” he was subjected to in the run-up to January 6 and the months that followed.\n\nRaffensperger and Sterling were attacked by Trump and his allies for certifying Georgia’s election. Sterling warned in a December 2020 news conference that “it’s all gone too far” after local election officials had been subjected to threats and harassment.\n\nMoss, who was a Fulton County election worker in 2020, will testify how her mother’s and her lives were upended and they were forced to go into hiding after Moss was accused by Trump of carrying out a fake ballot scheme, according to committee aides. She and another election worker sued Giuliani last year.\n\nIn her written testimony provided on Monday, Moss said the false stories accusing her of taking part in voter fraud had led to her receiving death threats.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nBritish filmmaker Alex Holder acknowledged Tuesday that he has complied with a subpoena from the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, turning over footage that includes never-before-seen interviews with former President Donald Trump, members of the Trump family and then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nHolder, who was filming a documentary series surrounding the final six weeks of Trump’s re-election campaign, wrote in a statement Tuesday that the interviews were filmed before and after the events of Jan. 6.\n\nHolder also says he will be deposed by the committee on Thursday. Politico first reported the committee’s subpoena of Holder. A Select Committee spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nSenior Trump campaign officials were caught off guard when they learned that the British filmmaker was given extensive access in the final weeks of President Trump’s 2020 campaign, several told CNN.\n\nThe first time senior campaign staff heard of the documentary was when it was reported by Politico Tuesday morning, according to one of the senior staffers. Another senior official on the campaign told CNN he was totally unaware Trump was cooperating with Holder, who says he has complied with a subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee to share his footage.\n\nThis aide, who traveled often with the President and worked out of his Arlington, Virginia, campaign headquarters, said he was also never asked to sign anything granting his permission to be filmed.\n\n“I don’t remember it. I honestly don’t recall ever being told about something like that,” the official said.\n\n“The first time senior 2020 campaign leadership ever heard of the documentary was this morning’s Politico Playbook,” another added.\n\nStephanie Grisham, who was chief of staff to former first lady Melania Trump during the campaign, told CNN she “had no idea” a filmmaker was documenting Trump’s reelection campaign and final days in the White House.\n\nA third campaign official also said the committee’s subpoena of a documentary filmmaker who was cooperating with Trump was news to him even though he spent most of his time on the campaign trail with the candidate himself.\n\n“I heard about it in passing,” said a third Trump campaign official, who is now involved in Trump’s post-presidential operation. “It wasn’t necessarily a secret.”\n\nTwo attorneys for Trump’s 2020 campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the two Republicans on the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot, said Sunday he thinks the committee is presenting a case against former President Trump that would “rise to a level of criminal involvement,” while also making clear that the Justice Department will ultimately decide whether to bring criminal charges for what happened on and leading up to Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Obviously, you know, we’re not a criminal charges committee. So I want to be careful in specifically using that language, but I think what we’re presenting before the American people certainly would rise to a level of criminal involvement by a president and definitely failure of the oath,” he added.\n\nCNN has reported committee members are in wide agreement that Trump committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. But they are divided over whether to make a criminal referral of Trump to the Justice Department, according to four sources connected to the panel.\n\nThe Illinois Republican reiterated this week’s hearings will focus on Trump’s efforts to push state officials to overturn 2020 election results, as well as a broader pressure campaign to involve the Justice Department in his scheme.\n\nHe said the committee’s purpose is to lay out Trump’s actions to the American people, and “what can the Department of Justice do in a court of law…that’s up to them. They can, you know, have their own information, they’ll be able to see what we’re doing here.”\n\nABC’s George Stephanopoulos said Kinzinger’s staff shared threatening communications with ABC News that the congressman had received that was too “ugly” and “dangerous” to share with viewers on screen.\n\nKinzinger explained the message was mailed to his house a few days ago from the local area, threatening to execute him, his wife and their five-month-old child.\n\n“I don’t worry, but now that I have a wife and kids, of course, it’s a little different,” he said. “There is violence in the future. I’m going to tell you. And until we get a grip on telling people the truth, we can’t expect any differently,” he said.\n\nThe House Jan. 6 committee will show evidence at its upcoming hearing about then-President Donald Trump’s involvement in a scheme to submit fake slates of electors in the 2020 presidential election, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the panel, said Sunday.\n\nFederal prosecutors are reviewing the fake Electoral College certifications created by Trump allies that falsely declared him the winner of seven states that he lost in 2020. The fake certificates were sent to the National Archives in the weeks after the election and had no impact on the electoral outcome.\n\nWhen asked by Bash specifically if the committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol had evidence Trump directed the fake electors scheme, Schiff responded, “I don’t want to get ahead of our hearing.”\n\n“We’ll show during the hearing what the President’s role was in trying to get states to name alternate slates of electors, how that scheme depended initially on hopes that the legislators would reconvene and bless it,” he said, adding, “We will show you what we know about his role in this.”\n\nThe committee’s upcoming hearing on Tuesday will also feature Georgia election officials and the Arizona House speaker who resisted pressure from Trump and his campaign to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nWith regards to witnesses: Schiff also said the committee still has “several key people we have not interviewed we would like to” and could still possibly subpoena former Vice President Mike Pence as part of its investigation.\n\n“(He’s) certainly a possibility,” Schiff said. “We’re not excluding anyone or anything at this point.”\n\nAlso Sunday, another House January 6 panelist said there needed to be “accountability” for the wrongdoing displayed in evidence and testimony before the select committee, but stopped short of calling on the Department of Justice to charge Trump.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that “accountability can mean two things. One is individual criminal accountability that people pay for their particular crimes, as more than 800 people have already been prosecuted for everything from assaulting a federal officer to interfering with a federal proceeding to seditious conspiracy.”\n\n“But accountability also means collective accountability, and that’s the real project,” he continued. “Telling the truth to the people so we can make decisions about how to fortify democratic institutions going forward.”\n\nMeanwhile, when asked by Bash about the January 6 committee’s decision not to turn over documents related to its investigation to the DOJ, Schiff defended the panel’s stance, saying, “I don’t think Congress has ever done that.”\n\nThe Justice Department had raised concerns in court that the select committee had not shared transcripts and was jeopardizing its ability to prosecute and investigate the Jan. 6 events. Schiff said the committee will work with the DOJ and “want them to be successful in bringing people to justice, but I can’t go into the private conversations.”\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol wrapped up its third hearing of the month on Thursday. The panel presented evidence that outlined former President Donald Trump’s role in pressuring former Vice President Mike Pence into blocking the 2020 election results.\n\nThrough live testimony from former Pence attorney Greg Jacob and retired judge J. Michael Luttig, recorded depositions and excerpts from emails and memos, the committee showed that Trump was told the plan to reverse the results of the election was not legal — but he tried it anyway.\n\nHere are the top headlines you might have missed:\n\nTrump’s attempts to pressure Pence: In her opening statements, committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney said that what Trump wanted Pence to do “was not just wrong, it was illegal and unconstitutional.” Members of the committee are in wide agreement that Trump committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. But they are split over what to do about it, including whether to make a criminal referral of Trump to the Justice Department, four sources connected to the panel told CNN.\n\nA “constitutional crisis:” Luttig testified that if Pence had followed Trump’s orders to reject the 2020 election result, it “would have been the first constitutional crisis since the founding of the republic.” He also testified that he believes the Jan. 6 committee is examining the “profound truth” of the US. He later said he “would have laid (his) body across the road” before advising Pence to overturn the election.\n\nProximity to the mob: The committee also laid out a timeline detailing the effort going on during the insurrection to protect Pence. The panel said the vice president was very close to the rioters, and at one point there was only “40 feet between the vice president and the mob.” According to committee member and Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar: “Make no mistake about the fact that the vice president’s life was in danger.”\n\nThe John Eastman memo: Eastman, a former Trump attorney, perpetuated the theory that Pence had the authority to decide the results of the election. In the memo presented by Cheney, Eastman argues there is a “historical precedent” for the vice president to reject electors. Luttig said in his testimony that Eastman was “incorrect” and there is no precedent and nothing in the Constitution or US laws that support the theory in the memo. Jacob then testified that Eastman told him that he knew the theory would lose at the Supreme Court unanimously.\n\nPressure even after the insurrection: Even after the Capitol riot was over, the committee said Eastman wrote an email that night imploring Jacob to suspend the session to certify the election. Jacob said he did not show Pence the email right away, but shared it a “day or two later.” Eastman argued a technical violation of the Electoral Count Act, the law that governed the Jan. 6 congressional certification of the electors. A few days after the insurrection, Eastman emailed Rudy Giuliani asking to be included on a list of potential recipients of a presidential pardon, according to the committee.\n\nIn the West Wing: Jacob testified that Pence called him into his office when he first heard the theory that the vice president could announce the outcome of the election. “The vice president’s first instinct when he heard this theory was that there was no way that our framers, who abhorred concentrated power and who had broken away from the tyranny of George III, would ever have put one person — particularly not a person who had a direct interest in the outcome because they were on the ticket for the election — in a role to have a decisive impact on the outcome of the election,” Jacob said, adding that instinct was correct. He said Pence’s legal team reviewed every election in American history, and no vice president in 230 years has ever claimed to have that kind of authority.\n\nRead key takeaways from the hearing:\n\nThe Republican who serves as Georgia’s top elections official is set to testify before the hearing held by the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol, multiple sources familiar with the plans told CNN.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, 66, is probably best known for refusing then-President Donald Trump’s push in a bombshell phone call to “find” votes in Trump’s favor needed to overturn the 2020 presidential results in Georgia. During the Jan. 2, 2021, call, Trump lambasted his fellow Republican for refusing to falsely say that he had won the election in Georgia and repeatedly touted baseless claims of election fraud.\n\nRaffensperger has continued to defend his performance and remains committed to the idea that the election was conducted fairly and offered a warning to those who charged otherwise without evidence.\n\nIt was among the strongest public stands for election integrity taken by a Republican under immense pressure from Trump and his followers — and it wasn’t without consequences.\n\n“You and your family will be killed very slowly,” read one anonymous text that Raffensperger’s wife, Tricia, told Reuters in an exclusive interview last year that she had received, an example of the kinds of threats and scrutiny his family faced. Brad Raffensperger told CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” at the time that the threats were unacceptable.\n\nRaffensperger became a pariah of sorts within the GOP, facing calls for resignation from within his own party and censure at the Georgia GOP convention in 2021 due to “dereliction of his constitutional duty.”\n\n“Let me start by saying that is not going to happen. The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,” he said at the time in response to the calls for him to step down.\n\n“As secretary of state, I’ll continue to fight every day to ensure fair elections in Georgia, that every legal vote counts and that illegal votes don’t count,” Raffensperger continued.\n\nRaffensperger, whose term is set to end next year, is running for reelection. He faced three opponents in the primary election in May, and CNN projected Raffensperger would win andbe the GOP nominee.\n\nHis leading opponent, Republican Rep. Jody Hice, had aligned himself with Trump’s political brand and previously said Trump would’ve won the 2020 election in Georgia if it had been “fair” — a stance that garnered an endorsement from the former President.\n\nIn a primary field in which his Republican opponents had committed themselves to fighting voter fraud — despite the fact that such fraud barely exists and President Biden’s 2020 victory in the Peach State was affirmed by three ballot counts — Raffensperger has expressed commitment to the same issue.\n\nRaffensperger has also supported a controversial law passed in the wake of Biden’s victory to impose new voting restrictions.\n\nThe secretary of state, who touts himself as a conservative Republican, took office in 2019. He had served two terms in the Georgia General Assembly in 2015-2019.\n\nRead more about the official here.\n\nJustice Department officials are watching the House select committee Jan. 6 hearings for what kind of possible crimes the committee believes it has uncovered.\n\nMembers of the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol are in wide agreement that former President Donald Trump committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. But they are split over what to do about it, sources close to the committee said.\n\nIt’s possible that at the end of the panel’s investigation, it makes criminal referrals or something less formal by turning over evidence that prosecutors could examine.\n\nRemember: A criminal referral is not an official responsibility of the Jan. 6 panel. And the DOJ would be under no legal obligation to act on the committee’s request, though it could force Attorney General Merrick Garland and his prosecutors into a difficult public position.\n\nAt the same time, if the committee opts not to make a referral, it would likely miss its best chance of making a forceful statement that it believes Trump committed a crime. Choosing not to make a referral would also mean abdicating one of the committee’s only levers of political pressure at its disposal.\n\nDuring a hearing for the criminal case against the Proud Boys, Justice Department prosecutors said that the committee is planning to release all 1,000 witness transcripts from its investigation in early September, coinciding with the trial of five Proud Boys charged with seditious conspiracy for their involvement in the riot.\n\nWhere the DOJ investigation stands: Seventeen months after the riot, the Justice Department has arrested over 840 individuals, charging roughly 255 with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers that day – 90 of whom are charged with using a weapon or causing serious injury to an officer.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, over 50 defendants have been charged with conspiracy, ranging from conspiring to obstruct a congressional proceeding to conspiring to obstruct law enforcement.\n\nSixteen individuals – members of the far-right groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers – have been charged with seditious conspiracy for their alleged actions that day, three of whom have pleaded guilty to the charge.\n\nBut the investigation is not close to being over. The Justice Department is still looking for over 350 individuals who they say “committed violent acts on Capitol grounds.”\n\nMost recently: A Capitol rioter pleaded guilty Friday to carrying a loaded firearm on Capitol grounds and assaulting police officers with one of their own batons during the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nMark Mazza told federal investigators he regretted not seeing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the riot and that they would be talking “for another reason” if he had seen her. He faces a maximum of 20 years for assaulting officers with a dangerous weapon.\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, Mazza, 57, carried a revolver loaded with shotgun and hollow point rounds in a holster under his shirt during the “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the riot and on Capitol grounds later that day.\n\nThe fourth Jan. 6 hearing this month is about to start. Here are some key points to catch up on before the next hearing gets underway.\n\nFormer President Trump didn’t want the Capitol riot to stop\n\nDuring the committee’s first prime-time hearing, it revealed testimony from Trump White House officials who said the former president did not want the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, to stop. He angrily resisted his advisers urging him to call off the rioters and thought his own vice president “deserved” to be hanged, according to the testimony.\n\nVice Chair Liz Cheney described a witness who said Trump was aware of chants to “hang Mike Pence” and seemed to approve of them.\n\nLater, at the hearing last week, the committee sought to connect Trump’s pressure campaign against Pence to the violence on Jan. 6 by weaving together testimony from Pence aides, as well as Trump’s public statements and comments from rioters at the Capitol.\n\nMany of the rioters had listened to Trump’s rallies where he claimed — inaccurately — that the election was rigged against him, and Pence had the power to do something about it while presiding over the Electoral College certification, the committee said.\n\nAnd many of them saw, in real time, Trump’s tweet criticizing Pence while the Capitol was under attack, where he said Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done.”\n\nThe committee showed that the mob got about 40 feet from Pence.\n\nJohn Eastman knew his theory to overturn the election was illegal\n\nThe hearing underscored how John Eastman, a former Trump attorney, had pushed over and over for Pence to try to overturn the election, despite facing sharp resistance from White House lawyers and Pence’s team.\n\nThe committee showed memos in which Eastman laid out his theory. Witnesses from Pence’s legal team testified that there was nothing in the Constitution or US law that supported the scheme. The committee played testimony from video depositions where White House officials explained how they thought Eastman’s theory was “nutty” before Jan. 6 — and told him so. Former Pence attorney Greg Jacob described Eastman’s plans as “certifiably crazy.”\n\nOn the evening of Jan. 6 — after rioters had attacked the Capitol and forced the vice president and his team to flee — Eastman tried to leverage the delay in certification by arguing there had been a minor violation of the Electoral Count Act and Pence should delay for 10 days as a result.\n\nJacob also testified that Eastman told him that he knew the theory would lose at the Supreme Court unanimously. Eastman emailed Rudy Giuliani a few days after Jan. 6 and asked to be included on a list of potential recipients of a presidential pardon, the committee said.\n\nTrump was told Eastman’s plan was illegal but tried it anyway\n\nAccording to witness testimony, Pence himself and the lawyer who concocted the scheme advised Trump directly that the plan was unconstitutional and violated federal law. Committee members argued that this shows Trump’s corrupt intentions and could lay the groundwork for a potential indictment.\n\nIn a videotaped deposition, which was played Thursday, Pence’s chief of staff Marc Short said Pence advised Trump “many times” that he didn’t have the legal or constitutional authority to overturn the results while presiding over the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 to count the electoral votes.\n\nEven Eastman, who pitched the scheme to Trump, admitted in front of Trump that the plan would require Pence to violate federal law, according to a clip of a deposition from Jacob.\n\nLegal scholars from across the political spectrum agree that Eastman’s plan was preposterous. J. Michael Luttig, the former federal judge who advised Pence during the transition, testified that he “would have laid my body across the road” before letting Pence illegally overturn the election.\n\nCommittee argues Trump peddled fraud claims after he was personally told they were not legitimate\n\nOne of the primary areas of focus of the committee has been to underscore the idea that Trump and some of his allies continued to peddle false claims of election fraud after they were personally told those claims were not legitimate.\n\nThe committee made the argument that Trump was repeatedly told by his own top officials, including former Attorney General William Barr and ex-Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, that the myriad of fraud claims he was pushing were groundless and were certainly not evidence that the election was stolen.\n\nYet, Trump and some of his allies continued to push these false claims all the way through January in what the committee attempted to show was a bad-faith effort to overturn the election despite consistently being told those claims were not valid.\n\nTrump’s team and family turn against him\n\nThe committee’s first hearing was bolstered with never-before-seen video clips showing members of Trump’s White House and campaign – as well as his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner – speaking about how they didn’t believe Trump’s claims that the election was stolen.\n\nBarr said that Trump’s claims of voter fraud were “bullshit.” Ivanka Trump said that she respected Barr and “accepted what he was saying” about the election.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said a campaign data staffer told Trump in “pretty blunt terms that he was going to lose.”\n\nAnd the committee cited testimony from Trump campaign lawyer Alex Cannon, who testified he told Meadows by “mid-to-late November” that the campaign had come up empty trying to find widespread fraud in key states that Trump lost. Cannon said Meadows responded to his assessment by saying, “so there’s no there there.”\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is set to continue to lay out its findings during a public hearing this morning. When and how the events occurred that day have been a key part of their probe.\n\nSupporters of then-President Trump breached the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, engulfing the building in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to protest against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to certify President Biden’s win.\n\nHere’s how key events unfolded throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump’s speech:\n\nAt 1:10 p.m. ET, while Congress began the process of affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, Trump encouraged his supporters to protest at the US Capitol. Despite promising he would join them, Trump retreated to the White House in his SUV and watched on television as the violence unfolded on Capitol Hill.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. ET, hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers “traitors” for doing their jobs.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Then-Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.\n\nAn armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.\n\nThe Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they had successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they were removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.\n\nThe US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first, and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building.\n\nWith about 30 minutes to go before Washington, DC’s 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds. It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.\n\nLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business — namely, confirming Biden’s win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.\n\nProceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence — who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary — bringing the Senate session back into order.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier on the evening of Jan. 6 that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session that night.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the “United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.”\n\nIt took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning (Jan. 7, 2021), but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden’s election win.\n\nSee the full timeline of events here.\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol — and now they are presenting what they discovered to the public.\n\nThe committee is holding another hearing Tuesday as it continues to roll out preliminary findings from its investigation in a series of presentations this month.\n\nThe committee is made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the panel.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel — and key things to know about them:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, chairman: Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, is the chairman of the House select committee. Thompson also serves as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, the first Democrat to hold the position. As chairman of the Homeland Security panel, Thompson introduced and oversaw the House’s passage of the legislative recommendations after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Thompson is a civil rights pioneer who started his political career by registering fellow African Americans to vote in the segregated South. His first political victory was being elected the first Black mayor of his hometown of Bolton, Mississippi. He is the only Democrat serving in Mississippi’s delegation. Thompson views the work of the Jan. 6 committee in the same vein as his work in the civil rights struggle.\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar: Aguilar is a Democrat from Southern California. Before coming to Congress, he served as the mayor of Redlands, California. Aguilar is considered a rising star in the House Democratic Caucus. As vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus he is the highest-ranking Latino member in congressional leadership. In addition to his role on the Jan. 6 committee, Aguilar has several high-profile committee assignments. He also is a member of the committees on Appropriations and House Administration. Aguilar believes the committee’s most important job is creating a full, comprehensive record of what led to the violence of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren: Lofgren is a Democrat from California who served as an impeachment manager in the first impeachment trial against Trump. Lofgren is also chair of the Committee on House Administration. She was first elected to Congress in 1994 and also served as a staffer on Capitol Hill for eight years. Lofgren has a background as an immigration lawyer and has made reforming immigration law a key part of her portfolio as a member of Congress. She also represents a big part of the Silicon Valley and as a result has had a heavy focus on tech related issues. She is a long-time ally and friend to Pelosi. The duo has served in the California Congressional delegation together for close to three decades and both represent different parts of the bay area in Northern California.\n\nRep. Elaine Luria: Luria is a Democrat from the Virginia Beach area who represents a community with a significant number of constituents connected to the military. Luria is a Navy Veteran. She served 20 years as an officer on Navy ships, retiring as a commander. She has attributed her military background as part of her motivation for serving on the Jan. 6 committee and getting to the bottom of what happened on that day. Of the nine members of the committee, Luria is facing the toughest general election in the fall midterms.\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy: Murphy is a Democrat from Florida and is the first Vietnamese American woman elected to Congress. Before serving in Congress, Murphy was a national security specialist in the office of the US Secretary of Defense. Murphy said the challenge for committee members is to translate the mountains of information learned through the investigation into a digestible narrative for the American people. Murphy announced in December 2021 that she would not be seeking reelection.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin: Raskin is a Democrat from Maryland who previously served as the lead impeachment manager for Democrats during Trump’s second impeachment trial. In the days before the Capitol insurrection, Raskin announced the death by suicide of his 25-year-old son, Tommy, on New Years Eve 2020. Raskin reflected on the tragic loss of his son, and his experience living through the attack on the Capitol, in his book “Unthinkable: Trauma, Truth and the Trials of American Democracy.” Raskin said that becoming the lead House impeachment manager last year served as a “lifeline” in the aftermath of his son’s death, describing to David Axelrod on “The Axe Files” podcast how Pelosi asked him to lead the second impeachment managers.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff: Schiff is a Democrat from California and also serves as the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He was the lead impeachment manager representing Democrats during Trump’s first impeachment trial. “January 6 will be remembered as one of the darkest days in our nation’s history. Yet, more than a year later, the threat to our democracy is as grave as ever. January 6 was not a day in isolation, but the violent culmination of multiple efforts to overturn the last presidential election and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in our history,” Schiff said in a statement to CNN.\n\nRepublicans\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, vice chair: Cheney, who represents Wyoming, serves as the vice chairwoman on the committee. Cheney has been an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump and was one of 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach him. House Republicans have punished her for her public opposition to Trump by removing her as their party’s conference chairwoman in May of last year and she faces a Trump-endorsed challenger in the GOP primary in her reelection bid. That primary is in August. Cheney told CBS in an interview that aired over the weekend that she believes the January 6 attack was a conspiracy, saying when asked, “I do. It is extremely broad. It’s extremely well organized. It’s really chilling.” She has even gone as far to say that Trump’s inaction to intervene as the attack unfolded was a “dereliction of duty.”\n\nAdam Kinzinger: Kinzinger of Illinois broke with his party by accepting the appointment from Pelosi. Kinzinger, once thought to have a bright future in GOP politics, has taken heavy criticism from his colleagues because of his criticism of Trump. He has placed much of the blame of inciting the violence that day on Trump and his allies. Kinzinger is one of 10 Republicans who voted twice to impeach Trump after the Capitol insurrection. He also voted for the bipartisan independent commission to investigate the riot. His willingness to take on Trump led to the former President personally promising to back a primary opponent. Instead of facing the prospect of a Trump back challenge, he chose to retire from Congress at the end of his current term.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/arizona-fake-electors-face-legal-130045420.html', 'Headline': 'Arizona fake electors face legal jeopardy, experts say - Yahoo', 'Snippet': 'GOP members in seven states where Joe Biden won the election, including Arizona, falsely signed documents in 2020 in an attempt to thwart the Electoral College.', 'Full_text': 'The people who falsely claimed to be Arizona\'s 2020 electors might not be named in the federal indictment of Donald Trump, but they still face serious legal peril, as do the people from Trump\'s team who directed them, some experts say.\n\nBut the legal debate over the issue has experts taking both sides, perhaps signaling that if an Arizona case develops, it won\'t be a slam dunk.\n\nGOP members in seven states where Joe Biden won the election, including Arizona, falsely signed documents in 2020 in an attempt to thwart the Electoral College. The federal indictment of Trump said this was part of a criminal conspiracy aimed at keeping him in office.\n\nThe Michigan electors were each charged with eight felonies and released on $1,000 bonds.\n\nAt least eight of the 16 fake electors in Georgia have been offered immunity.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes\' office has said Arizona\'s electors are under investigation. The office declined further comment Friday.\n\nJoshua Stanton, counsel at Perry Law who is based in Washington, D.C., said that it’s not just the fake electors who face jeopardy, but those who might have misled those people before they signed the documents claiming to be the rightful electors.\n\n“There is significant evidence that a lot of these false electors it seems across the country were aware that Trump had definitely lost, that his litigation attempts were bogus, and that this was really being used as part of an effort, an illegal effort, to overturn the election,"" said Stanton, who clerked at U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.\n\nAt a previous firm he represented recording artists, professional athletes, actors and business executives.\n\nHe said prosecuting the electors might depend on what they were told by people working with Trump to overturn the election, and whether they thought they were only to be used if the elections in those states were overturned by the courts for some reason. They in fact were used even though court challenges to overturn the state elections all failed.\n\n“If the false electors, when they signed that form, honestly believed that (they would only be used if the GOP won in court), then it seems likely that they didn’t do anything wrong,” Stanton said. “It would be hard to actually prosecute them.”\n\nNone of the Arizona GOP representatives who signed false documents contacted by The Arizona Republic in recent months have agreed to talk on the record.\n\nStanton said it’s possible prosecutors already have evidence to show they knew the documents would be sent to Congress even if the courts didn\'t overturn the state elections. It appears the co-conspirators named in the indictment didn\'t plan to use the fake electors only as a contingency.\n\n“Even if the false electors themselves maybe potentially avoid liability, there are a number of people at the higher levels that could face charges in Arizona,” Stanton said.\n\nHe said that based on what is known publicly so far, charges could still come from the federal or state level for those people.\n\nThe indictment seems to offer an out to the false electors by stating they were misled by people trying to help Trump overturn the election.\n\n“It’s not necessarily the false electors who could end up getting indicted,"" Stanton said. ""It’s the folks who maybe misled them.""\n\nElection exodus: The exodus of Arizona election officials continues. This time, it\'s in ruby-red Mohave County\n\nStanton referenced emails from Arizona lawyer Jack Wilenchik, reported last year in The New York Times, including one in which Wilenchik referred to the electors as ""fake.""\n\n“We would just be sending in ‘fake’ electoral votes to Pence so that ‘someone’ in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the ‘fake’ votes should be counted,” Wilenchik wrote in a Dec. 8, 2020, email to Boris Epshteyn, a strategic adviser for the Trump campaign, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik later wrote that “alternative” was a better term than “fake.”\n\nWilenchik also wrote the idea that it could launch an objection in Congress to certifying the vote for Biden, and acknowledged that the electors\' votes should not count, according to another email reported by the Times.\n\n“His idea is basically that all of us (GA, WI, AZ, PA, etc.) have our electors send in their votes (even though the votes aren’t legal under federal law — because they’re not signed by the Governor); so that members of Congress can fight about whether they should be counted on January 6th,” Wilenchik wrote in the email on Dec. 8, 2020, to Epshteyn and others, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik told The Arizona Republic on Friday that in those emails he was only offering an opinion on the plan for Trump\'s campaign staff when asked, and he believed the actions were legal.\n\n""I believed then and I believe now it is completely legal, as do a number of legal scholars,"" Wilenchik said. ""There is no crime I can even conceive of here.""\n\nHe referenced recent comments from legal scholar Alan Dershowitz supporting the idea that submitting alternate electors is the proper way to protest an election.\n\nDershowitz, a nationally recognized constitutional lawyer, recently said during a FOX News appearance that submitting the alternate electors was the proper way to address state elections where the rightful winner is undecided.\n\n""The way you protest an election is to come up with an alternate slate of electors. That was done in 1960,"" Dershowitz said, referencing the race in Hawaii that year between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.\n\nNixon was certified the winner by the state governor after prevailing by 140 votes that year, but a recount was underway the day electors met to cast votes. Electors for both candidates signed certificates and delivered them to Congress.\n\n""And a court in Hawaii said that\'s the right way to do it,"" continued Dershowitz, who was recently among a team of lawyers sanctioned for filing a meritless lawsuit on behalf of Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake that sought to force counties to hand count ballots.\n\nWilenchik said Dershowitz\'s comments support the move as legitimate, and he called the prosecution in Michigan ""bogus and political.""\n\n“What these people put on their certificates here in Arizona was just that we believe we are the duly elected electors. They didn’t say they were certified. They weren’t certified,"" Wilenchik continued. ""That is what I was pointing out in the email. Certified means the governor and secretary of state were signing off on it.”\n\nWilenchik said he did not mislead any of the people who signed the documents or tell them the documents would only be submitted if courts overturned Arizona’s election.\n\nExpert says state charges more likely than federal\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political sciences in the School of Global Politics and the Sandra Day O\'Connor College of Law at ASU, said state charges are more likely than federal charges for the Arizona fake electors.\n\n“It may be that the federal government has concluded this is best left to the state attorneys general to prosecute,” she said.\n\nLindquist clerked for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia and practiced law at Latham and Watkins in Washington, D.C.\n\nEven setting aside the possibility of charging the electors with a criminal conspiracy, Arizona has a statute that criminalizes creating a public record ""knowing that it has been falsely made,"" that could apply to the document the electors sent to Congress, she said.\n\nIt doesn\'t help the Arizona fake electors that two states, Pennsylvania and New Mexico, offered conditional language in their documents stating they would only be valid if those state elections were overturned, while Arizona and the other states did not.\n\nThe federal indictment states that Trump’s allies wanted to prevent the other fake electors from using similar conditional language, which she said was improper on their part.\n\n“What a cynical, fraudulent thing to do to these dupes in the state legislatures,” she said. “It’s not that these people shouldn’t have known better. I think they should have. There’s no doubt they were manipulated by the conspirators.”\n\nIt’s possible the Justice Department intentionally let the electors off the hook so that it might secure testimony from those people to help prosecute Trump or the co-conspirators, she said.\n\nThe states where fake electors submitted documents were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe fake electors in Arizona were: Tyler Bowyer, an executive with Turning Point USA and a committeeman for the Republican National Committee; Nancy Cottle, who chaired the Arizona Trump electors; lawmaker Jake Hoffman; state senator Anthony Kern; Jim Lamon, a failed U.S. Senate candidate; Robert Montgomery of the Cochise County Republican Committee; Samuel Moorhead of the Gila County Republican Party; Loraine Pellegrino, the secretary of the Arizona Trump electors; Greg Safsten, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; Kelli Ward, the state GOP chair at the time; and Michael Ward, her husband and a GOP activist.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/11-republicans-affirmed-donald-trump-130058456.html', 'Headline': '11 Republicans affirmed Donald Trump won in Arizona.

In 2020, legitimate electors designated by the Democratic Party cast their votes for Joe Biden, who had won Arizona by a 10,457-vote margin.\n\nThe 11 Republicans weren\'t qualified electors for the 2020 election, Trump didn\'t win Arizona, and their votes were not official. They celebrated anyway, immortalizing the moment in a Twitter video.\n\nIn all, 84 people — including elected officials, candidates, former officeholders and Republican party leaders — from groups in seven swing states falsely claimed to be alternate electors in a coordinated plot to keep Trump in office.\n\nJump ahead two years. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has launched an investigation into the state\'s fake electors, after similar probes by federal and state prosecutors in Nevada, Georgia and Michigan.\n\nAnd the 11 Arizonans who applauded eagerly at the time are unwilling to talk about their decisions, declining interview requests, hanging up on calls and retreating from questions.\n\nHere is what you need to know about the GOP\'s slate of fake electors.\n\nTyler Bowyer\n\nBowyer, 37, is the chief operating officer at Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that advocates for conservative politics on high school, college and university campuses.\n\nBowyer\'s biography on Turning Point\'s website touts his ""strong desire to combat Marxist-Leninist philosophy from entering the American political mainstream."" He describes himself as a seventh-generation Arizonan.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jan Brewer appointed Bowyer as a student regent on the Arizona Board of Regents in 2011. He has worked for the Republican National Committee and served as chairman of the Maricopa County Republican Party from 2015-2017.\n\nIn July 2015, Bowyer helped to convene a rally at the Phoenix Convention Center that served as an early national sign of the future president\'s appeal.\n\nBowyer has declined recent interview requests about the electors. In 2022, he told The Arizona Republic he didn’t know “all the details and facts” but emphasized his role as an elector.\n\n“I was an elector − I want to make sure we’re clear here − I was an elector for the Republican Party.”\n\nNancy Cottle\n\nNancy Cottle, 71, of Mesa, chaired the Arizona Trump electors.\n\nCottle was subpoenaed by House Select Committee investigating the riot at the U.S. Capitol for her ""role and participation in the purported slate of electors casting votes for Donald Trump and, to the extent relevant, your role in the events of January 6, 2021.”\n\nCottle, has served on the Arizona GOP Executive Committee and the Maricopa County Republicans Committee. She led the Pledge of Allegiance at a Jan. 15, 2022,Trump rally in Florence, ending with the rallying cry, ""Let\'s Go Brandon.""\n\nShe describes herself on Twitter as a ""political junkie"" and an ""ultra MAGA."" Her LinkedIn page lists her as a ""strong consulting professional"" with a background in business planning. Cottle is the owner of The Branded Image.\n\nShe has a master\'s degree in operational management from the University of Phoenix and a bachelor\'s in health, physical education and speech from Kent State University, according to her bio.\n\nCottle has not responded to multiple interview requests.\n\nState Sen. Jake Hoffman\n\nState Sen. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, chairs the Legislature\'s conservative Freedom Caucus.\n\nOn Jan. 5, 2021, Hoffman sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence asking him not to accept the state\'s official electoral votes. Although Hoffman had not yet taken office, the letter was sent on official state letterhead and had a return address of the state Capitol.\n\nHoffman has proposed and supported so-called election integrity bills, including one that would trigger an automatic redo of an election in which voters had to wait in line more than 90 minutes and another to break up Maricopa County into four counties. Both of those failed.\n\nHoffman, 38, is the married father of five, according to online biographies. He previously served on the Higley School Board and the Queen Creek Town Council. He was a communications director with Turning Point USA and runs several conservative digital marketing companies.\n\nIn 2020, a company he operated called Rally Forge was accused of operating a troll farm for a Turning Point affiliate and was banned from Facebook and suspended from Twitter. The company paid teens to set up bogus accounts and flood social media with posts sowing distrust in mail-in ballots and downplaying COVID-19.\n\nAnother of Hoffman\'s companies, 1Ten, received $2.1 million from a political action committee that used spoof donors to boost the campaign of failed gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. The owners of California businesses who were listed as the source of funds said they had never heard of the PAC − or Lake.\n\nHoffman has avoided questions about the fake electors. In a brief interview outside the Capitol in 2022, he told The Arizona Republic electors wanted to provide Congress and Pence with ""dueling opinions"" before walking away.\n\nHe dodged questions again in June. When asked about investigations, Hoffman retreated to a members-only stairwell at The Capitol.\n\nState Sen. Anthony Kern\n\nState Sen. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale, is an ardent Trump supporter who spoke at ""Stop the Steal"" rallies and was at the U.S. Capitol when it was sacked by rioters. He has given conflicting accounts about where he was that day, but photos and videos show him on the Capitol steps.\n\nKern, 61, predicted in speeches he gave before the riot that Jan. 6 would be a ""big day,"" frothing up crowds by asking if this was ""a revolution."" He told The Republic in 2022 what happened at the Capitol was a partisan hoax.\n\nKern in 2005 was hired as a civilian code enforcement officer for The El Mirage Police Department. He was fired in 2014 for lying to a supervisor after a string of disciplinary problems. The department also put Kern on the Brady list, a database of officers accused of dishonesty.\n\nKern was elected to Arizona\'s House of Representatives in 2015. He falsely claimed on financial disclosure forms that he was a certified law enforcement officer. In 2019, he tried to pass a law to overhaul the Brady List without acknowledging he would directly benefit by getting his name removed. He lost his seat in the 2020 election.\n\nAfter swearing an oath of fealty to Trump in 2020, Kern was tapped to help count and inspect ballots during the Arizona Senate\'s ""audit"" of Maricopa County election results led by Cyber Ninjas. Contractors ousted Kern after several days later because of ""optics.""\n\nKern has repeatedly declined to discuss his role as a Trump elector. During a June interview, he brushed off questions and said he didn\'t need a lawyer.\n\nOnly people who have done something wrong or had something to hide would need to hire a lawyer, he said.\n\nJim Lamon\n\nJim Lamon ran for U.S. Senate in 2022 and lost in the Republican primary.\n\nLamon, 67, of Paradise Valley, is married with two children. He grew up on a farm in Alabama before joining the U.S. Army. He was stationed in Germany in the Cold War and served as an airborne officer.\n\nLamon earned a bachelor\'s degree in civil engineering from the University of Alabama in 1979.\n\nHe describes himself on LinkedIn as a Fortune 500 executive. Lamon is the founder of Scottsdale-based Depcom Power, a solar engineering and construction company that employed 1,600 across the nation when he sold it.\n\nBefore entering politics, Lamon was known as a reliable donor to Republican causes and candidates, including Trump. He was a behind-the-scenes player in the Arizona Senate\'s ""audit"" and helped bankroll security.\n\nLamon made immigration and border security a cornerstone of his platform and sought to restore Trump-era policies that returned asylum seekers to Mexico while awaiting court hearings. He was also critical of the Biden Administration\'s COVID-19 relief package.\n\nDespite pouring millions of his own money into his campaign, Lamon lost to Republican challenger Blake Masters, who was defeated by Democrat Mark Kelly.\n\nLamon has not responded to interview requests about the electors. In 2022, while he was running for Senate, he appeared on KTVK-TV’s “Politics Unplugged” and claimed the electors were part of a backup plan in case Trump succeeded in his election fraud challenges.\n\n“The Republican electors put forth a valid document that said, in the event that the election certification was overturned, there would be no excuse not to recognize those electors,” Lamon said.\n\nThe signed document, however, had no such proviso.\n\nRobert Montgomery\n\nRobert Montgomery is the former chair of the Cochise County Republican Committee. He was unseated by a surprise challenger in December and resigned from the committee in response.\n\nMontgomery, 72, of Hereford, pushed for hand counts of votes as committee chair and before the 2022 election told Cochise County Supervisors they should ignore warnings about it from then-Secretary of State Katie Hobbs.\n\nHe told the supervisors to throw Hobbs\' letter “in the bucket somewhere” and argued a full hand-count would be “easy to do,” according to a report by Votebeat.\n\nMontgomery said former State Rep. Mark Finchem − an election denier and conspiracy theorist − would support hand counts if he won his bid for secretary of state. Finchem lost in a landslide to his Democratic challenger.\n\nThe Cochise County Board of Supervisors in September appointed Montgomery to the Palominas Fire District board. The decision came despite protests from some Sierra Vista residents who said Montgomery\'s role as a fake elector should disqualify him. They complained Montgomery should not be rewarded for trying to overturn the election.\n\nHe is also on the county\'s planning and zoning commission.\n\nMontgomery has repeatedly declined to discuss his role as a fake elector. He did not respond to messages left at his home or at the fire district in July.\n\nSamuel Moorhead\n\nSamuel Moorhead is the elected vice president of the Gila County Community College District governing board, which he joined in 2012.\n\nHe was serving as the second vice chair of the Gila County Republican Party when he signed as a Trump elector.\n\nAccording to online biographies, Moorhead, 78, of Globe, is married and has four children and five grandchildren. He was born in Pennsylvania and served as a Navy corpsman for 14 years, doing multiple tours in Vietnam.\n\nMoorhead has a bachelor\'s degree in education from Edinboro State University in Pennsylvania and earned a master\'s degree in special education and teaching from New Mexico State University in 1999. He is listed as a consultant on his LinkedIn page.\n\nHe taught at schools in New Mexico and Arizona. Moorhead also was a commercial driver for Werner Enterprises until his retirement in 2007.\n\nMoorhead has not responded to calls and messages about his role as a Trump elector.\n\nLoraine Pellegrino\n\nLoraine Pellegrino, 65, of Phoenix, was secretary for the Arizona Trump electors.\n\nPellegrino is one of four electors subpoenaed by House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nShe has an extensive background in Arizona Republican politics. Pellegrino is past president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women and is a founding member of the Ahwatukee Republican Women\'s Club.\n\nHer online biography highlights her election as a delegate to Republican National Committee conventions in 2012, 2016 and 2020. She has served three terms on the Arizona GOP Executive Committee. She lists the recruitment of Republican women to run for office as one of her personal achievements.\n\nPellegrino has lived in Arizona for 25 years. She was born and raised in Connecticut and has a bachelor\'s degree in media studies from Sacred Heart University. She is married and has one son.\n\nPellegrino in a January 2022 interview said the electors met as a contingency “in case there was a change in the decision here in the state."" She couldn\'t say how the plan came together but bristled at the characterization of the group as ""alternate"" electors.\n\n“We were electors for Trump and we were hoping things would change,” she said. “Just in case, we signed our paperwork to be ready in the event that something was overturned.”\n\nPellegrino told The Republic in May 2022 nothing had come of subpoenas from the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nPellegrino hung up when contacted in July about the attorney general\'s investigation.\n\nGreg Safsten\n\nGreg Safsten was executive director of the Arizona Republican Party when he signed as a Trump elector.\n\nSafsten, 35, of Gilbert, was hired as a campaign consultant in 2022 by U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters, who was defeated in the general election. He had previously worked as an adviser and director for Rep. Andy Biggs and Rep. Matt Salmon.\n\nAccording to his Legistorm biography, Safsten got his start in 2012 as a field director for Salmon\'s campaign and was later hired as his legislative assistant. In 2016, he went to work for the Biggs campaign and ultimately rose to the position of deputy chief of staff.\n\nPolice and court records show in 2022 he was arrested and pleaded guilty to extreme DUI.\n\nAccording to a March 2022, search warrant affidavit filed in Maricopa County Superior Court, a Gilbert police officer saw Safsten speed away from a Taco Bell restaurant ""losing control of his vehicle as it fishtailed"" and nearly collided with another vehicle.\n\nThe officer said Safsten kept going when he initially tried to pull him over, driving at a high rate of speed and weaving between lanes until finally pulling over about a half-mile later. He failed a field sobriety test, records show.\n\nSafsten was fined and sentenced in January to 60 months\' probation, records show.\n\nSafsten\'s LinkedIn page has no employment information after August 2022. He bills himself as a ""seasoned public relations, communications, public policy & political executive.""\n\n""I work to be the leader and teammate I\'d want on my own team,"" he writes on his page. ""Having formed and led teams in various conditions for over a dozen years, I know what it takes to win.""\n\nSafsten was born and raised in Mesa. He attended Mountain View High School and obtained a bachelor\'s degree in international studies from Arizona State University in 2007. He also studied clinical laboratory science at Weber State University in Utah.\n\nSafsten did not respond to an interview request.\n\nKelli Ward\n\nKelli Ward is the past chair of the Arizona GOP. She helped to organize the signing of the fake electors, sat at the head of the table during the ""signing"" video and boasted about the moment on Twitter.\n\n""Oh, yes we did!"" Ward wrote in a Dec. 14, 2020 post. ""We are the electors who represent the legal voters of Arizona! #Trump2020 #MAGA.""\n\nWard, 54, of Lake Havasu City, was among those subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee and the Department of Justice over the slate of fake electors. Her attorney said in 2022 Ward was engaging in First Amendment-protected activity.\n\nIn testifying before the Jan. 6 committee, Ward exercised her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 200 times.\n\nWard is an osteopathic physician turned politician. She was elected to the Arizona Senate in 2013. She resigned to go after John McCain\'s U.S. Senate seat in 2016, losing in the Republican primary, 39% to McCain\'s 51%. She tried again for U.S. Senate in 2018 and lost in the Republican primary to Martha McSally.\n\nWard became party chair in 2019 and after the 2020 election became one of Trump\'s most ardent supporters, launching several unsuccessful lawsuits to overturn Arizona\'s election.\n\nWard promoted various voter fraud conspiracies and championed the Arizona Senate\'s ""audit,"" delivering frequent YouTube updates as the ballot count unfolded, which turned into a fundraising bonanza for the party\'s candidates and causes.\n\nThe party took in more cash during the first four months of 2021 than it had during full election cycles.\n\nWard is married and has three children. She was born in West Virginia. She earned a bachelor\'s degree in psychology from Duke University and a doctorate from West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine. She has a master\'s degree in public health from A.T. Still University, according to her legislative biography.\n\nShe practiced emergency medicine in Lake Havasu City and Kingman.\n\nWard was replaced as party chair in 2023. She and her husband announced on YouTube they bought a 44-foot catamaran and were starting a charter business called Sail American Honey.\n\nWard has not responded to interview requests about the electors.\n\nMichael Ward\n\nMichael Ward is Kelli Ward\'s husband and a GOP activist. He, too, has been subpoenaed by the Department of Justice for his role as a Trump elector.\n\nWard, 58, of Lake Havasu City, is an emergency physician and is the state air surgeon in the Arizona Air National Guard, according to his LinkedIn page. He formerly worked at Havasu Regional Medical Center.\n\nWard first enlisted in the US Air Force in 1983 and began his military medical career. He joined the reserves and was commissioned to active duty in 1992, according to a listing on America\'s Mighty Warriors, a veteran\'s support group.\n\nWard earned a doctorate in osteopathic medicine in 1995 from A.T. Still University, where he met Kelli, according to her biography. They were married in 1995. Ward served as his wife\'s campaign manager from 2011-2015.\n\nHe was accused in 2019 of spitting in the eye of one of his wife\'s former volunteers. Police records indicate the alleged incident happened at the Arizona Republican Party\'s general election night gala in Paradise Valley.\n\nThe former volunteer said Michael Ward was angry because the volunteer was supporting Kelli Ward\'s political opponent, Martha McSally, according to police reports. Michael Ward emailed the Paradise Valley police and denied the allegations. He told police his accuser was an attention seeker and known storyteller.\n\nMichael Ward also had a reputation for confronting people on his wife\'s behalf. He was accused of bullying a staffer of Sen. John McCain at a Tea Party event in 2016. The moment was captured on video.\n\nMichael Ward did not respond to an interview request about the attorney general\'s investigation into the Trump electors.\n\nArizona\'s second slate of fake electors\n\nArizona spawned a second group of fake electors in 2020 who certified that it, too, had cast the state\'s votes for Trump.\n\nThe lesser-known Trump loyalists called themselves “The Sovereign Citizens of the Great State of Arizona” and sent the National Archives in Washington, D.C., notarized documents that carried the state seal on their letterhead. The signers were:\n\nFederico Buck, a real estate professional.\n\nCynthia Franco.\n\nSarai Franco.\n\nStewart A. Hogue.\n\nJamie Hunsaker, a Trump enthusiast.\n\nCarrie Lundell.\n\nChristeen Taryn Moser.\n\nDanjee J.

They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nInstead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.\n\nMuch attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.\n\nNow those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.\n\n“They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.”\n\nAttorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.\n\n“It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.”\n\nAll 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.\n\nOf the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.\n\nEach of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.\n\n“The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.\n\nElectors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.\n\nCNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.\n\nFive vocal fake electors\n\nThe most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results.\n\n“We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.\n\nWard’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.\n\n“My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22.\n\nAnother prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.\n\n“It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.\n\nIn repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.\n\n“It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.\n\n“We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback.\n\nA spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.\n\nBowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.\n\nThe spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ.\n\nNewly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.\n\n“It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman.\n\nIn interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.\n\nThen-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing “stop the steal” content and participating in their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector.\n\n“On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December.\n\n“There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added.\n\nKern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with CNN.\n\n“Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said.\n\nKern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol.\n\n“In DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in a tweet.'}}",98.33333333333333,1

Viral online posts distorted his comments to misleadingly claim that half of employees at federal health agencies “are refusing” the vaccines, which Fauci never said.\n\nAt the time, NIAID told us that 67% of the NIH staff were vaccinated, but the “actual number may be higher” because reporting was voluntary.\n\nSee, “Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations,” May 21, 2021\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. But a Gateway Pundit story shared on Facebook in June 2021 declared, “SMOKING GUN: FAUCI LIED, MILLIONS DIED — Fauci Was Informed of Hydroxychloroquine Success in Early 2020 But Lied to Public Instead Despite the Science.”\n\nThe story was based on two emails that were sent to Fauci in February 2020. In one email, two doctors expressed the possibility that the drug could be effective against COVID-19. Fauci forwarded the email to an NIH deputy director who works in microbiology and infectious diseases and wrote: “Please take a look and respond to them. Thanks.”\n\nIn the other email, a pharmacologist made reference to “data from 2005 showing inhibition of SARS infection,” which is a different disease caused by a different coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) from the one that leads to COVID-19. We previously wrote about a 2005 study that found the drug prevented the spread of that SARS virus in cell culture — which is not the same as working in humans.\n\nThose emails are not evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, or that Fauci kept this from the public. In fact, randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The drug was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nA viral social media post falsely claimed that Fauci was “pushing” remdesivir because he “invented” it with Bill Gates and they would profit from its use.\n\nFauci does not hold a patent for remdesivir, and a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told USA Today that the foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of the drug.\n\nSee, “Fauci Didn’t Invent, Won’t Profit from Remdesivir,” May 21, 2020\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nIt is still uncertain how SARS-CoV-2 originated, but many scientists suspect the virus “spilled over” into humans from an animal. There is no evidence the virus was created in a lab, let alone as part of any U.S.-funded research.\n\nA June 2021 Facebook post claimed that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” because of an email he received from Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. In that Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” He mentioned others, too, found “the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\n\nBut Andersen said in his email that more analysis was necessary and “opinions could still change,” which is what later happened.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists that said they determined that the coronavirus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The authors added that they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.”\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nFormer White House trade adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that Fauci “killed a lot of people” by funding some bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is in Wuhan, China, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified.\n\nNIAID did provide a multimillion-dollar grant to fund some of the lab’s research, but the NIH has explained that those experiments could not have led to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because the viruses that were being studied were very different.\n\n“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” then-NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20, 2021, statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”\n\nSee, “Navarro Falsely Links Fauci to Pandemic Origin,” May 19, 2022\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul accused Fauci of lying when Fauci said in a May 2021 Senate hearing that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” But there’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in a July 20, 2021, hearing, about funding gain-of-function research — which the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to “increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.”\n\nFauci has said that the research that was funded “was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,” and the NIH has said the same. The issue is that scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul has posited that Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” if the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research. But there is no proof of a lab leak, and there is evidence that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant could not have caused the pandemic.\n\nSee, “The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,” May 21, 2021, and “Fauci and Paul, Round 2,” July 22, 2021\n\nIn December 2014, the NIH posted a photo of Fauci and former President Barack Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The photo showed Obama speaking about Ebola research with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, and Fauci was shown standing next to Sylvia Burwell, who was the health and human services secretary at the time.\n\nBut the years-old photo was circulated in 2020 along with the false claim that the image showed “Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015,” suggesting a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee, “Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab,'”July 17, 2020\n\nOther Claims\n\nA series of reports in 2021 from a group that opposes federal funding for research relying on animal testing prompted dozens of readers to ask us if Fauci had a history of cruelty to animals, specifically beagles.\n\nThe NIAID admitted to FactCheck.org in a statement that Fauci was involved in the process of awarding funding for a number of research projects that used beagles as test subjects. But the agency denied that it funded one particular project in Tunisia that went viral on social media because of images from a published study that showed sedated beagles with their heads stuck in mesh cages filled with diseased sand flies.\n\nSee, “Answering Questions About #BeagleGate,” Nov. 2, 2021\n\nFauci is among the many federal employees who are required to submit an annual public financial disclosure report to their employing agency or department. His reports — which list his assets, income, employment agreements and other financial information — are available upon request from the NIH’s FOIA office.\n\nBut in a January congressional hearing, Republican Sen. Roger Marshall asked Fauci if he would be willing to publicly release “a financial disclosure form,” suggesting that Fauci’s reports are not available to the public and are being hidden by “the big tech giants.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/politics/biden-admin-suspends-wuhan-lab-funding/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden administration suspends funding for Wuhan lab', 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that ...', 'Full_text': 'The Biden administration has suspended funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology following a monthslong review that determined that the Chinese research institute “is not compliant with federal regulations and is not presently responsible,” according to a memo from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHHS, which conducted the review, also proposed barring the Wuhan Institute from doing business with the federal government going forward, according to the memo, which is dated to Monday and was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe lab has not received any federal funding from the US National Institutes of Health since July 2020, according to an HHS spokesperson.\n\nThe determination came after the research institute failed to provide the National Institutes of Health with requested documents amid reported safety concerns at the lab.\n\n“This action aims to ensure that WIV does not receive another dollar of federal funding,” an HHS spokesperson said in a statement. “The move was undertaken due to WIV’s failure to provide documentation on WIV’s research requested by NIH related to concerns that WIV violated NIH’s biosafety protocols.”\n\nIn Monday’s memorandum, HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for acquisition concludes that the Wuhan Institute’s “disregard of the NIH’s requests” and the NIH’s conclusion that the institute’s research likely violated biosafety protocols present a risk that the institute “not only previously violated, but is currently violating, and will continue to violate, protocols of the NIH on biosafety.”\n\n“Therefore, I have determined that the immediate suspension of WIV is necessary to mitigate any potential public health risk,” the official, whose name is redacted, writes in the memo.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology is at the center of a theory that Covid-19 escaped from the lab in late 2019, triggering the global pandemic and nearly 7 million recorded deaths. The virus was first identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report last month that stated the US intelligence community could not determine whether researchers at the lab who fell ill in the fall of 2019 were infected with Covid-19, but identified safety and security issues at the lab. Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nationalreview.com/news/fauci-knew-nih-funded-wuhans-gain-of-function-research-as-pandemic-began-email-reveals/', 'Headline': ""Anthony Fauci Knew NIH Funded Wuhan's Gain-of-Function Research as ..."", 'Snippet': 'Months later, a top NIH official admitted in an October 2021 letter that the NIH did fund gain-of-function research on coronaviruses, despite Fauci’s argument to the contrary.', 'Full_text': ''}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01566-0', 'Headline': 'NIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research - Nature', 'Snippet': 'NIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research EcoHealth Alliance lost funding during the Trump administration, but can now proceed with its research — under extensive restrictions. By', 'Full_text': 'The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has reinstated a grant to a highly scrutinized research organization that studies bat coronaviruses — but the agency has placed several stipulations on the scope of the research and on the organization’s accounting practices.\n\nThe move caps a years-long saga that has thrust the EcoHealth Alliance, a small non-profit organization in New York City, into the political fray for its collaborations with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China. In April 2020, after then-US-president Donald Trump hinted that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a WIV laboratory, the NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant. Its goal was to study how coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, jump from bats to humans. A few months later, the NIH reinstated and immediately suspended the award until certain conditions were met that, at the time, EcoHealth said were impossible to complete.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature applaud the renewal, adding that this type of research is essential to avert the next pandemic. They claim that the NIH’s termination and subsequent suspension were politically motivated, and that, although long overdue, this renewal ends — for now — a drama-filled exchange between the agency and EcoHealth.\n\n“It’s about goddam time,” says Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, who organized researchers to push back against EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020. “The integrity of science requires a barrier against political interference,” he says.\n\nThe NIH “routinely considers processes and measures for strengthening [its] oversight over federal funds” and has been working with EcoHealth to strengthen its “administrative processes to meet NIH’s expectations”, says Amanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Washington DC.\n\nLengthy list of conditions\n\nAlthough the organization will now be able to continue its bat coronavirus research for the first time since the saga began, the NIH placed an extensive list of restrictions on the four-year, US$2.9-million award. None of the researchers who spoke to Nature had ever seen a grant with so many stipulations.\n\nAmong other things, EcoHealth is specifically forbidden from performing any in-country research in China, including with the WIV, or collecting any new samples from vertebrates — such as bats. The revised grant also mandates greater scrutiny of EcoHealth’s finances and accounting practices, driven in part by a federal watchdog report, released in January, finding that EcoHealth had misreported about $90,000 in expenses. The report also faulted the NIH for improperly terminating EcoHealth’s grant.\n\nFurthermore, EcoHealth will be forbidden from performing any work that is deemed by the NIH’s parent organization, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to have the potential to enhance the virulence or transmission of a virus. This restriction stems, in part, from criticism that research done at the WIV and funded by an EcoHealth subaward qualified as ‘gain of function’ research.\n\nDisputed research\n\nCongressional Republicans have alleged that this research, which involved attaching spike proteins from wild bat coronaviruses to an unrelated virus to determine whether the wild pathogens could infect human airway cells, should have undergone HHS review. Anthony Fauci, then-director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the agency concluded that these experiments did not meet the bar to undergo such review, and noted that the WIV did not intend to enhance the viruses.\n\nTens of thousands of people exposed to bat coronaviruses each year\n\nVirologists say this type of research is essential for developing vaccines and therapeutics against emerging pathogens and for understanding how likely a pathogen is to spark a pandemic. The NIH and HHS have been finalizing guidance that will probably tighten the oversight of such research in the United States.\n\n“I don’t know if any other single grantee from NIH has been subjected to this level of oversight,” says Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance. Yet he is “positive and optimistic” about the grant restart, despite all the restrictions. A key priority for the newly released funds will be analysing nearly 300 partial or complete genomes of SARS-related coronaviruses from samples that the organization collected before the funding halt, he says.\n\nThird rail of virology\n\nThese restrictions seem reasonable, in light of the enormous public attention to and scrutiny of gain-of-function research, says Lawrence Gostin, a health-law and policy specialist at Georgetown University in Washington DC. Still, Gostin says he is surprised the agency restarted its funding for EcoHealth, given that it has been the “third rail of politics” the past few years.\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, says she is pleasantly surprised to see the grant renewed, but worries about the “terrible precedent” that the NIH set by “arbitrarily” terminating an award on the basis of “unfounded rumours” regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2. She hopes that these same restrictions will not apply to other scientists doing similar work, but is encouraged by the number of research groups that are now studying coronaviruses following the COVID-19 pandemic.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://thebulletin.org/2022/08/nih-to-terminate-ecohealth-alliance-grant-after-its-wuhan-partners-refuse-to-deliver-information-on-coronavirus-studies/', 'Headline': 'NIH to terminate part of EcoHealth Alliance grant after its Wuhan ...', 'Snippet': 'In an Aug. 19 letter to Kentucky Rep James Comer, the top Republican member of the US House Oversight Committee, Michael Lauer, the deputy director of extramural research at NIH, said the agency had informed EcoHealth that it was terminating the sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology “for failure to meet award terms and conditions ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institute of Health (NIH) is partially terminating a grant to a nonprofit that worked extensively with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on bat coronavirus research. In letters posted by Republicans on the House Oversight Committee this month, an NIH official said EcoHealth Alliance had not been able to hand over lab notebooks and other records from its Wuhan partner that relate to controversial experiments involving modified bat viruses, despite multiple requests.\n\nIn an Aug. 19 letter to Kentucky Rep James Comer, the top Republican member of the US House Oversight Committee, Michael Lauer, the deputy director of extramural research at NIH, said the agency had informed EcoHealth that it was terminating the sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology “for failure to meet award terms and conditions requiring provision of records to NIH upon request.”\n\nThe termination notice comes after the NIH chided EcoHealth last fall for not immediately notifying the agency after its experiments showed modified coronaviruses replicated at a faster rate in experimental mice than an unmodified virus. The agency then asked for lab notebooks and other files pertaining to the experiments, and EcoHealth reported that it would relay the request to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the new NIH letters, the Wuhan institute never delivered.\n\n“NIH has requested on two occasions that [EcoHealth] provide NIH the laboratory notebooks and original electronic files from the research conducted at [the Wuhan Institute of Virology]. To date, [the institute] has not provided these records,” Lauer told Comer. NIH verified to the Bulletin that the letters were authentic.\n\nA letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide the requested records, and [EcoHealth’s] failure to include the required terms in [the] subaward agreement represent material failures to comply with the terms of award,” the letter said.\n\nBetween June 2017 and May 2019, scientists working on EcoHealth’s grant tested genetically engineered coronaviruses with the backbone of one virus and the spike proteins—which bind to host cells—of another on mice that expressed human cell receptors. In one case, the NIH reported last fall, one of the chimeric viruses caused mice to become “sicker.” EcoHealth reports show that in the infection experiments, conducted in years four and five of the grant, chimeric viruses replicated faster in mice lungs and killed a higher percentage of mice than the unmodified virus. Last fall, the NIH said that EcoHealth was supposed to report the increased viral growth to the agency “immediately” to assess whether further biosafety measures were necessary.\n\nThe NIH said the Wuhan institute’s experiments under the EcoHealth grant involved viruses that were too genetically distant to have evolved to become SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But some critics of so-called gain-of-function experimentation—in which pathogens are enhanced in way that makes them, say, more transmissible—have said last fall’s revelations point to risky research projects being undertaken at the laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the first reported cases of COVID were reported. Research published recently in Science points to the pandemic having sprung from a seafood market in the city where animals that could have harbored coronavirus infections were kept. That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth has not responded to a request for comment about NIH’s decision to partially terminate its grant.\n\nAccording to the new NIH letters, EcoHealth can work with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to revise the grants without involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If that is not possible, the NIH will ask that the grant be “bilaterally terminated.” Should a reworked grant be possible, the agency will add new terms to it, including increased NIH oversight over EcoHealth for at least three years and increased reporting requirements for the nonprofit. The nonprofit will also be required to visit its sub-awardees every six months to ensure compliance with the grant.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/extremely-disconcerting-nih-didnt-track-us-funds-going-to-chinese-virus-research-watchdog-finds-004808475.html', 'Headline': ""'Extremely disconcerting': NIH didn't track U.S. funds going to ... - Yahoo"", 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, a new government ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, according to a new government report that is sure to raise new questions about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe report is evidence of “major failures in past NIH oversight of high-risk research on enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” Rutgers molecular biologist Richard Ebright told Yahoo News in an email.\n\nIssued by the inspector general of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the new report says nothing about the origins of the coronavirus. For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners. But he has also conceded that much about how the virus came to be remains unknown.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/covid-origins-researchers-house-subcommittee-hearing/index.html', 'Headline': 'Scientists at House hearing refute claims they were bribed and ...', 'Snippet': 'Members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei, Province on January 11 ...', 'Full_text': 'Democrats on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic said they aimed to use a hearing Tuesday to set the record straight on Republicans’ claims that Drs. Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins steered scientists investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic away from the idea that the virus was created in a lab in Wuhan, China.\n\nIn a report released in advance of the hearing, Democrats highlighted sworn testimony by authors of the “Proximal Origin” paper that was published in March 2020 in the journal Nature – the paper that first concluded that the pandemic was most likely caused by a viral spillover event from animals to humans.\n\nThat testimony, they said, shows that Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British biomedical scientist who was then director of the Wellcome Trust health research charity and is now chief scientist for the World Health Organization, organized and led the scientific effort that produced both that paper and the February conference call that laid the groundwork for it, rather than Fauci or Collins. Fauci was then head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Collins was head of the National Institutes of Health. Both played critical roles in the nation’s pandemic response.\n\nThe conference call and the paper have become fodder for conspiracy theories claiming that Fauci and Collins pressured scientists to abandon the “lab leak” theory in favor of the natural origins hypothesis.\n\nDr. Kristian Andersen, who studies the genetics of infectious diseases at the Scripps Research Institute, testified Tuesday that in the early days of the pandemic, he first thought the virus that causes Covid-19 had genomic features that might have pointed to laboratory manipulation.\n\n“My initial hypothesis was that SARS-CoV-2 was likely an engineered virus,” Andersen told the committee. “This was based on limited data and preliminary analyses where I had observed features that appeared to be unique.”\n\nHe shared those early concerns with Fauci, who advised him to draft a scientific paper outlining his theory. But Andersen said he changed his mind after learning more about these kinds of viruses.\n\n“We soon discovered that those features are readily found in related coronaviruses, and the virus itself looks to be a clear product of natural selection and not actual engineering,” he said.\n\nHe said scientists often adjust their thinking in the face of evidence. It’s not a flip-flop but how the scientific process works.\n\nAndersen, who said he found his name on online “kill lists” because of allegations that he was part of a coverup, also disputed allegations that he and his co-authors were bribed to change their public statements with promises of grant money.\n\n“It has also been suggested that a grant awarded to myself and colleagues from five different countries was a quid pro quo for changing our conclusions. These allegations are false,” he said.\n\nRepublicans on the committee weren’t happy with those explanations.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican, pressed Andersen to explain the change in his thinking.\n\n“Within a matter of days, something changed,” she said, between Andersen’s emails and calls to Fauci in late January 2020 and the February 1, 2020, conference call with about a dozen other researchers from around the world. “And that’s what this committee is trying to get to the bottom of. What happened within that three-day period between the conference call and the paper that all of a sudden you did a 180, and it couldn’t possibly come from a lab?” she asked. “What happened in those three days?”\n\nDr. Robert Garry, a microbiologist and immunologist at Tulane University, explained that they examined the genomes of other coronaviruses.\n\n“Well, we examined the genomes more closely. We looked at other coronaviruses. And there was some new data that came. There was the data come from the scientific literature,” he said.\n\nGarry said the publication of a similar coronavirus isolated from animals called pangolins showed some of the same changes as the virus that eventually infected humans.\n\n“It was a very important piece of data, because it showed that a lot of the theories about the virus having been engineered or put together in a laboratory were not true, because here was a virus in nature that had a receptor-binding domain with exactly” the same features, he said.\n\nAndersen said the genetic adaptation that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans was “suboptimal,” suggesting to him that it was of natural origin. If the virus had been engineered in a lab, he said, the changes probably would have been more precise.\n\nAndersen also pushed back on the timeline repeated by Republicans on the committee: He said he didn’t change his mind in three days but within about 45 days, as he drafted the Nature paper.\n\nBoth scientists said that if convincing evidence were to emerge that supported the theory that the virus came from lab manipulation, they would consider it.\n\n“It is still my opinion that there is no credible scientific evidence for a lab-based origin for SARS-CoV-2,” Garry said.\n\nRep. John Joyce, a Republican physician from Pennsylvania, asked how some US intelligence agencies – namely the Department of Energy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation – had concluded that the virus probably came from a lab.\n\n“Dr. Andersen, you also said in your testimony, ‘we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,’ and yet two conclusions by the Department of Energy and the FBI directly contradict your position. How do you bring that together?” Joyce said.\n\n“I think you could say that our conclusions completely contradict their conclusions, too,” Andersen said. “I think it’s important to understand that we’re looking at different things here. You’re talking about the intelligence community. If you look at the scientific literature, the scientific evidence for this pointing to a single market in the middle of Wuhan is overwhelming.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Raul Ruiz, an ER doctor who is ranking member of the committee, said that months of the panel’s work had been a biased effort that had shed no additional light on the pandemic’s origins but had sown mistrust in science and the nation’s scientists.\n\n“We have undertaken all of this work, but to what end? Has targeting these researchers and probing the publication of this paper meaningfully advanced our efforts to prevent and prepare for future pandemics?” he asked.\n\n“Or has it been about fishing for evidence to prove their confirmation bias, their theories with a goal of advancing a predetermined partisan narrative targeting Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins and our nation’s scientists and public health officials.”\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, chided her Republican colleagues for feeding public hatred of scientists and public servants.\n\n“I am so offended by some of the things I’ve heard today, of baseless allegations against our nation’s scientists, our public health experts, including Drs. Fauci and Collins, and instead of being on a mission to destroy two people, I wish we were on a mission to get the facts,” she said.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.statnews.com/2022/10/18/bu-lab-wasnt-required-to-clear-potentially-controversial-study-with-nih-director-says/', 'Headline': 'BU lab wasn’t required to clear Covid study with NIH, director says', 'Snippet': 'The director of a Boston University laboratory that conducted potentially controversial research on the viruses that cause Covid-19 said his institution didn’t clear the work with the NIH ...', 'Full_text': ""The director of a Boston University laboratory that conducted potentially controversial research on the viruses that cause Covid-19 said his institution didn’t clear the work with the National Institutes of Health because it wasn’t funded by the federal agency.\n\nRonald Corley said the research, which was designed to explore what makes some SARS-CoV-2 viruses more pathogenic than others, was paid for with money from the university itself. The work was approved by the institutional biosafety committee of BU’s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, and by Boston’s Public Health Commission.\n\nadvertisement\n\nScientists from the BU facility posted results from their work in a preprint, a study that has yet to go through peer review. The British tabloid The Daily Mail published an explosive article about the work on Monday, suggesting the group had fabricated a more dangerous version of the SARS-2 Omicron variant.\n\nIn response to questioning from STAT, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which had awarded two grants to the research group, said on Monday that it should have been informed about the nature of the work beforehand, in order for a review to be conducted.\n\nNewsletters\n\nSign up for Daily Recap\n\nA roundup of STAT's top stories of the day.\n\nPlease enter a valid email address.\n\nEmily Erbelding, director of NIAID’s division of microbiology and infectious diseases, said that is the policy set out in what’s known as the P3CO framework, which lays out the rules for work that could lead to enhancement of dangerous pathogens.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“What we would have wanted to do is to talk about exactly what they wanted to do in advance, and if it met what the P3CO framework defines as enhanced pathogen of pandemic potential, ePPP, we could have put a package forward for review by the committee that’s convened by HHS, the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response. That’s what the framework lays out and that’s what we would have done,” she said.\n\nBut the policy only applies to work of this type that is funded by the federal government. And NIAID money was not used for this research, Corley said.\n\nSome funding from NIAID went towards work that might be considered foundational to the questioned research. Corley said the team used some of the federal funds to develop a system for making plasmids it would need to do the later work.\n\nHe acknowledged it can be difficult to see where lines are drawn, when research groups are using different pots of money to fund their work.\n\n“It is a murky world, but in our view because the funding was not supporting the work that was supported in this paper, that it wasn’t necessary to report it to NIH,” he said.\n\nSTAT asked the NIAID if it was satisfied with Boston University’s response. The agency’s response, received by email on Tuesday evening, did not directly answer the question, though it indicated the situation is still being investigated.\n\n“NIH is examining the matter to determine whether the research conducted was subject to the NIH Grants Policy Statement or met the criteria for review under the HHS Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (HHS P3CO framework),” the statement said.\n\nCorley also challenged the notion that the work done by scientist Mohsan Saeed and colleagues was what is known as “gain of function” research. The group created a hybrid or chimeric virus — in which the spike protein of an Omicron version of SARS-2 was fused to a virus of the Wuhan strain, the original version that emerged from China in 2020. Omicron viruses first emerged in late 2021 and have since splintered into multiple different subvariants.\n\nThe purpose of the work was to see if the mutations in the Omicron spike protein were responsible for the lower rate of severity caused by Omicron viruses.\n\nThe testing actually showed, though, that the chimeric virus was more lethal to a type of lab mice than Omicron itself, killing 80% of the mice infected. But the original Wuhan strain killed 100% of mice it was tested in. That suggests that the spike protein itself is not responsible for the pathogenicity of SARS-2 viruses, Corley said.\n\nHe noted that because the chimeric virus was less dangerous in mice than the original strain, this work could not be characterized as gain of function research. That is unlikely to assuage critics of the work, who may argue that the Wuhan strain is not the right benchmark to use as a comparison, given that it no longer circulates. The chimeric virus was more pathogenic than the currently circulating SARS-2 viruses, which are Omicron variants.\n\nBut it is important to note that the severity in the species of mice used in the experiment is not reflective of what happens in people. All of the mice exposed to the original SARS-2 viruses died. Less than 1% of people who contracted those viruses died.\n\nCorley said that BU safety protocols require that if researchers produce a pathogen that is more virulent than the Wuhan strains, they must immediately report it to the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Saeed’s study protocol further stipulated that if such an event occurred, he would immediately stop the work and destroy the viruses, Corley noted.\n\nSTAT approached Saeed for an interview but he did not respond to the request.\n\nCorley said the principal investigators of the study — Saeed is one of two — spoke Tuesday with their program managers at the NIH.\n\n“They support the work that we’re doing and we certainly want to make sure that we are on comfortable ground,” Corley said.\n\n— This article has been updated with a comment from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/23/at-a-time-when-the-u-s-needed-covid-19-dialogue-between-scientists-francis-collins-moved-to-shut-it-down/', 'Headline': ""NIH director Francis Collins wanted a 'take-down' to stifle ... - STAT"", 'Snippet': 'In October 2020, the U.S. needed scientific debate on how best to control Covid-19. NIH director Francis Collins tried to quash it.', 'Full_text': 'This week, emails released through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Institute for Economic Research revealed what I see as worrisome communication between Francis Collins, Anthony Fauci, and others within the National Institutes of Health in the fall of 2020. At issue was the Great Barrington Declaration, an open letter written in October 2020 and eventually signed by thousands of scientists. It argues that Covid-19 policy should focus on protecting the elderly and vulnerable, and largely re-open society and school for others.\n\nAt the time, Americans would have benefited from a broad debate among scientists about the available policy options for controlling the Covid-19 pandemic, and perhaps a bit of compromise. The emails tell us why that isn’t what we got.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAn email written by Collins, the director of the NIH, which was addressed to Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and several others read:\n\nCollins appeared on television this week to confirm that the email was authentic, and that he stood by the message. At the time, he believed the Great Barrington Declaration idea of focused protection would result in more deaths than the alternative view of one-size-fits all restrictions. Collins also confirmed that he believed the three authors of the declaration were “fringe” scientists.\n\nOctober 2020, when Collins wrote that email, was a time fraught with uncertainty. Positive results from Pfizer’s ongoing vaccine trial were still four weeks away. Many Americans were fatigued with ongoing restrictions, either imposed by governments or self-imposed. And two dueling documents — the Great Barrington Declaration and the John Snow Memorandum — were released and garnered thousands of signatures. The declaration argued for focused protection and permitting many people to return to normal life. The memorandum favored prolonged one-size-fits all restrictions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAt the time, I did not take sides, and urged public dialogue between scientists who held both views. We needed “a Covid policy response that engages with people who hold views and perspectives different than our own,” I wrote then.\n\nWhat concerns me about the NIH director’s email and his interview on television is that he appeared unwilling to have this dialogue. Collins’s day job does not make him arbiter of scientific truth, the Pope for all scientists. On questions of unprecedented pandemic policy, he is surely entitled to his opinion — as we all are — but his is just one opinion of many.\n\nWhen it comes to lockdowns or school closures, the answer to the question of whether the benefits exceed the harms and, if so, under what conditions, is far from certain, and scientists will continue to study this for decades. As a good scientist, Collins should have recognized the massive uncertainty around these policies.\n\nCollins’s response to a memo signed by thousands of scientists should not have been to call for an immediate and devastating take down, but to use his pulpit as NIH director to hold a series of public discussions and dialogues. In a world where scientists were trapped in their own homes for months, a series of dialogues — even virtual ones — made available for the broader scientific community, policy makers, and the public would have benefited us all.\n\nIt is possible that through the heat of dialogue, weak premises of the argument for focused protection might have been revealed. But it is also possible that the idea might have attracted even more scientists to devise creative ways to achieve the goal, and who would have recognized the gargantuan trade-offs involved in pandemic policy to date.\n\nIt’s also possible that compromises might have been struck. One tenet of the Great Barrington Declaration was that schools should reopen immediately and broadly. In hindsight, it is now clear that reopening schools could have been done safely, as was done in many European nations in 2020 and in the U.S. in the fall of 2021, even before vaccines became available for children. A public forum between scientists might not have accepted all of the reasoning in the declaration, but might have reached a vital compromise, which would have benefitted millions of children, particularly poor or disadvantaged children — and their parents. Unfortunately, we failed them all.\n\nA dialogue might also have led to better strategies for nursing home residents, the group most decimated by Covid-19. The U.S. did not — but could have — launched a large, registry-based randomized trial in this cohort, similar to the U.K.’s recovery trial. Such a trial might have helped vaccinate more of these at-risk individuals sooner and, with the first hint of vaccine efficacy in November 2020, all participants could have been crossed over to receive vaccines. Other intense strategies to aggressively test nursing home workers may have been proposed and received unanimous support.\n\nJeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School, and I called for dialogue and debate among scientists without demonization in April 2020. I’m disappointed to see a few months later that the NIH director, a man uniquely positioned to foster such a debate, had actively sought to thwart and discredit scientists with alternative ideas to the pandemic response. His ad-hominem comment that the authors were “fringe” was unnecessary and unhelpful. In the weeks that followed, more and more mud would be slung against the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, as well as against scientists who held alternative policy views, and favored more and stronger restrictions. The vitriol ensured that the country would not have the dialogue it so desperately needed.\n\nI must admit that I don’t know what would have happened had scientists been more willing to talk to each other. I believe that the world of social isolation — a world of seeing each other through the Post-it-sized Zoom squares — led to dehumanization and irrational hatred, which led to two entrenched policy poles with little room for compromise.\n\nHad Collins, a man who has contributed greatly to science, chosen dialogue instead of contributing to animosity and combativeness, we might have been in a better place today.\n\nVinay Prasad is a hematologist-oncologist, associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California San Francisco, and author of “Malignant: How Bad Policy and Bad Evidence Harm People with Cancer” (Johns Hopkins University Press, April 2020).'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01930-0', 'Headline': 'NIH to intensify scrutiny of foreign grant recipients in wake ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'The Wuhan Institute of Virology in China has been at the centre of the debate over COVID-19’s origins. ...

The NIH’s dealings with ...', 'Full_text': 'Researchers are upset over a new policy released by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to tighten oversight of its ‘subawards’. These are funds that a primary grant recipient can give to a collaborator to perform research on their behalf. The biomedical funder’s policy, set to go into effect on 1 October, specifies that foreign subaward recipients, in particular, will be subject to extra scrutiny.\n\nForeign collaborators will have to provide copies of all relevant laboratory notebooks, data and documentation to the primary recipient every few months. The NIH also reserves the right to request access to this supporting documentation as part of its oversight responsibilities.\n\nNIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research\n\nThe NIH’s dealings with foreign researchers have drawn attention as debate rages over whether the COVID-19 pandemic started with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 passing from animals to humans or from a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China, which is located in the city where early cases were detected.\n\nThe non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, based in New York City, has been especially scrutinized. It had received NIH funds to study coronaviruses, and the WIV received a subaward on this grant to study bat coronaviruses in the wild and their potential to infect people. Part of this work involved creating hybrid bat coronaviruses, which some critics have decried as risky ‘gain of function’ research. (On the basis of EcoHealth’s grant application, the NIH determined that this study didn’t meet the bar for risky research.)\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature worry that the change to the NIH’s subawards policy will have a chilling effect on international collaborations; foreign researchers might forgo partnerships because of the requirements. They also say that scientists will have to spend an unreasonable amount of time on administrative tasks to comply with the policy.\n\nThe policy is “heavy handed” and disrespectful to international collaborators, says Sheela Shenoi, an infectious-disease physician at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “It suggests that international collaborators need additional oversight — that they don’t have capacity to do their own research in a rigorous and robust way.”\n\nAmanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, responds that this provision “empowers primary recipients to obtain, on a regular basis, records and data from foreign subrecipients without having to worry that they will not be able to access materials when needed”. She adds: “As part of high-quality science, there should be a free flow of information, documents and data.”\n\nUnder fire\n\nThe NIH has come under fire from federal auditors for, among other things, its handling of the EcoHealth grant. When it first funded EcoHealth, the NIH instructed the organization to report any evidence of unexpected transmissibility or virulence of the hybrid viruses. A progress report from EcoHealth was two years late owing to a miscommunication and a technical glitch, the organization has said. Federal auditors have criticized the NIH for not pursuing the late report and recommended that the agency intensify its monitoring of foreign subaward recipients.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nThe NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant in 2020, but then said it would reinstate it if EcoHealth could meet certain conditions, including obtaining the WIV’s lab notebooks. In part because EcoHealth was unable to do so, last August the NIH terminated the subaward altogether.\n\nPeter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, responds that oversight of federally funded research is important, but that the subaward policy might have unintended consequences that are counter to its mission. “This might lead to countries cutting collaborative ties with US scientists, rather than handing over their laboratory notebooks,” he says. “This would weaken America’s pandemic preparedness at the very time when we need to be developing partnerships in regions where the next pandemic is most likely to originate.”\n\nConcerns voiced\n\nResearchers have condemned the policy’s focus on foreign subrecipients. Stefano Bertuzzi, chief executive of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington DC, says he supports extra accountability and oversight for subawards, but he is “puzzled by why only foreign entities are singled out”.\n\nA virologist from Brazil, who requested anonymity out of fear that their chances of receiving funding could be harmed, says the policy adds a layer of bureaucracy, crafted with politics — not science — in mind.\n\n‘Heinous!’: Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions\n\nIn addition to concerns about international partnerships, Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, says that the policy imposes an administrative burden without providing more funding to meet the requirements. Keusch organized researchers to protest EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020.\n\nFor some researchers, this isn’t a trivial matter. Oleksandr Zeziulin, a specialist in drug abuse and mental health at the Ukrainian Institute on Public Health Policy in Kyiv, says that, because of Russia’s invasion last year, Ukraine has been struggling with constant power outages. “During the winter, we were struggling with our normal schedule, and we’re expecting the same next winter, given Russia’s attacks on power plants,” says Zeziulin, who is a subrecipient of a grant with Shenoi. “If this policy will require an extra 10% of our time, I think it’s going to be [difficult], given the situation we’re in.”\n\nNot all researchers think the policy is unreasonable, however. David Relman, a microbiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, says it addresses concerns that “US expectations and standards for research reproducibility and transparency may not be shared elsewhere in the world”. But he has concerns that it might discourage international collaborations and worries that it’s unclear which elements of lab notebooks would need to be shared. He calls on the NIH to clarify this provision and to clearly communicate to the research community the motivations and goals of the policy.\n\nThe ambiguity could mean that the policy will face legal challenges in some countries, says the Brazilian virologist. Many researchers work on several overlapping research projects from various funders, and some countries carefully safeguard data — for instance, biodiversity data in Brazil — that will be difficult to keep separate.\n\nThe agency is accepting comments on the policy until 26 June, but it’s unclear whether it will make revisions based on feedback. Fine says: “These changes have been made, they are not proposed.”'}}",95.55555555555556,1

The pair’s seminal paper in 2005 described how they were able to successfully deliver modified mRNA into the body and trigger an immune response—the kind that trains the immune system for future viral infections. Over the years, their research with mRNA vaccines solved some of the major issues confronting the technique, such as the inflammatory response by the body that involves the production of harmful cytokines. During the pandemic, this mRNA technology led to the production of highly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-causing virus, and particularly ones that were adaptable for large-scale rollout.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

This was “largely due to ... improvements in the technology and this basic discovery.”\n\nKarikó was born in 1955 in Szolnok, Hungary. In 1989 she became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained until 2013. She was a senior vice president at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals—a major manufacturer of an mRNA COVID vaccine—and is now an external consultant for BioNTech. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWeissman was born in 1959 in Lexington, Mass. In 1997 he established his research group at the Perelman School of Medicine. Weissman is Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation.\n\n“The award, to me, is really a victory for vaccines and the potential for vaccines to advance health and improve equity,” says Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccinology professor and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nMany vaccines had been created with weakened or deactivated whole viruses, but in recent decades many researchers have been investigating smaller viral parts, such as viral genetic material: DNA or RNA. When Karikó and Weissman injected the foreign in vitro mRNA into human cells, they found that it created a strong immune reaction that elevated protective antibodies. Subsequent inflammation, as well as enzymes in human blood and cells, would degrade the mRNA, however. Despite these scientific roadblocks, skepticism and difficulties with funding, Karikó and Weissman continued to search for solutions.\n\n“It was nonstop technical hurdles for 25 years,” Weissman reflects. “We couldn’t get funding, Kati [Karikó] kept getting demoted and pushed out. It was very difficult to do this research, but we saw early on the potential and how important RNA was likely to be. And that kept us going. We never gave up.”\n\nThe team found a way to modify mRNA to be less inflammatory—replacing uridine, one of its building block molecules, with a similar molecule called pseudouridine. They also developed a more efficient delivery system that used lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA and help it to enter cells for protein production.\n\n“In the early days of vaccinology, we would take a bacteria, we would take a virus, and we would weaken it, or we would combine it with another antigen. But here this was really a targeted immune system approach, both from the use of the mRNA and the use of the lipid nanoparticle,” Neuzil says. “So, to me, that was quite impressive—that they took an entirely different approach to vaccine delivery.”\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, Karikó and Weissman conducted several animal trials with mRNA vaccines for a variety of different pathogens such as Zika, influenza and HIV. “In every animal model we looked at, HIV was the only one that didn’t work well,” Weissman says. “Just about every single one of them gave us 100 percent protection.”\n\nThe research unlocked a new path for possible therapy and vaccine development—one that would prove critical during the COVID pandemic.\n\nAdapting for a Global Public Health Emergency\n\nWhen SARS-CoV-2 began to spread worldwide, Weissman and Karikó’s mRNA research quickly became a candidate and basis for vaccines against the virus. The mRNA vaccine approach had several advantages, Weissman explains. Only a sequence of the original pathogen was needed rather than an actual piece or full virus. “There’s no growing a virus and inactivating it. It’s a very simple procedure, and that’s because it’s a simple enzymatic reaction,” Weissman says. “It was two months from the sequence being released to the first patients getting the vaccine.”\n\nClinical trials, production and rollout of the vaccines greatly expanded, with companies creating hundreds of millions of doses within a year. “Switching over to COVID, it was just a technical thing,” Karikó told Scientific American in a 2021 interview. “It was already ready.”\n\nThe mRNA COVID vaccines work by injecting the genetic material specifically for SARS-CoV-2’s spike proteins—surface proteins on the virus that allow it to bind to healthy cells. Modified mRNA in the vaccine is taken by cells, which then decode it and produce those spike proteins so that the immune system can better identify and neutralize the real virus in the event of a future infection.\n\n“We’re coming off the worst pandemic in more than a century, and certainly these vaccines contributed to lives saved and to less morbidity,” says Neuzil, who has also been working on mRNA vaccines for malaria. “I think an adaptation of this technology and mRNA vaccines could really be transformative, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, because of the adaptability and flexibility of the platform.”\n\nFuture Therapies\n\nFor future vaccines, the application can be quite broad, Weissman says. When Karikó first became interested in mRNA research, she wasn’t initially seeking to develop vaccines. “I was making this modification in the RNA because I always wanted to develop it for therapies,” she told Scientific American in 2021.\n\nWhile the mRNA technology has helped to tackle the COVID pandemic, a tremendous number of people will benefit from the technology, says Niek Sanders, a principal investigator at Ghent University’s Laboratory of Gene Therapy in Belgium. “It can also be used to treat any disease that is due to a malfunctioning protein as it allows patients produce their own therapeutic proteins,” Sanders says. “Nobel Prizes with such a high impact on society are rare and occur only once in 25 or 50 years.”\n\nWeissman, Karikó and other research groups are already trying to apply the technology to autoimmune diseases, cancers, food and environmental allergies, bacterial diseases and insect-borne diseases. In July Weissman and his colleagues published a paper in Science that showed they could deliver RNA gene-editing machinery directly to bone marrow stem cells. This could be key for treating diseases such as sickle cell anemia, in which stem cells are typically taken from an individual, cultured and treated, and then put back into the body. “Now we can give them an off-the-shelf injection of RNA and cure their disease, and that has applicability to thousands of other bone marrow diseases. And then you can expand that to liver, to lung, to brain, to every other organ therapeutics,” Weissman says. “The potential is just enormous.”\n\nWeissman hopes that the mRNA treatment will be available to sickle cell anemia patients in a year and a half. He also has many mRNA clinical trials underway, including a phase 1 trial for the disease amyloidosis and vaccine trials for HIV, norovirus and malaria. Wiessman’s team is also planning to start clinical trials soon on a pan-coronavirus mRNA vaccine, which could help prevent future coronavirus epidemics.\n\n“The future is now,” Weissman says. “These therapeutics are in people right now.”""}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/02/1202941256/nobel-prize-goes-to-scientists-who-made-mrna-covid-vaccines-possible', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize goes to scientists who made mRNA COVID vaccines possible', 'Snippet': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.', 'Full_text': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nKatalin Karikó and Drew Weissman met at copy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and collaborated for decades to try to find ways to use genetic material called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to make vaccines.\n\nThe scientists discovered that modifying a chemical building block of mRNA kept the immune system from destroying the material and enabled it to instead stimulate protection against viruses.

""But Kati (Karikó) lit the match and we spent the rest of our 20 plus years working together figuring out how to get it to work.""\n\nKarikó, 68, had to overcome big challenges. For years, she went from one low-paying research job to another and even slept in her office at times. She says she was forced to retire from Penn and then commuted to work at BioNTech. But said she never gave up. And her mother never gave up hope she\'d eventually win a Nobel.\n\n""My mom, who passed away two years ago at age 89, every fall she was listening and she said to me, \'You know, you might get this year.\' And I said, \'Mom, I couldn\'t even get a grant,\' "" Karikó said in a 2020 interview with NPR.\n\nThe first prize in the category was awarded in 1901.

The laureates are Dr. Katalin Karikó (68), an advisor to the German biotech company BioNTech and a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the USA, and Dr. Drew Weissman (64), a professor at the same university. In a press conference on October 2, the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden highly praised the research achievements of the two scientists, stating, ""13 billion doses of the vaccine were administered worldwide, and this saved the lives of millions of people, allowing for society to return to normal.""\n\nDr. Karikó and her colleagues developed a technology that allows mRNA to enter the body without triggering an inflammatory response. They achieved this by replacing certain substances that make up mRNA. Based on this technology, BioNTech collaborated with the US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, and US-based Moderna also developed a vaccine with a similar mechanism. At the end of 2020, less than a year from the start of development, the vaccine was put into practical use and has been widely used in various countries worldwide.\n\nDr. Karikó was born in Hungary during the Cold War and learned molecular biology while living a modest life. After struggling to immigrate to the USA, she met Dr. Weissman, and they continued their research together. Karikó was asleep early in the morning when she received the call from the Nobel Foundation. She later attended a press conference at the University of Pennsylvania and encouraged female students to follow in her footsteps.\n\nThe two researcher\'s technology allows for practical use of the vaccine in less than a year\n\nThe novel coronavirus was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In Japan, the first infected person was confirmed in mid-January 2020, after the new year. The disease quickly spread to various European countries, the USA, and Asia. Meanwhile, the viral genome sequence was disclosed to the public shortly after the first confirmation of infection. Less than a year afterward, BioNTech and Pfizer developed mRNA vaccines. In December of the same year, vaccination with the Pfizer−BioNTech vaccine started in the UK, and the vaccine was quickly disseminated worldwide. Vaccination with the Moderna vaccine followed.\n\nVaccines that protect against viral infections have used viral proteins and other substances that are harmless to the human body to date. However, the drawback is that it takes time for such vaccine development and production (i.e., before practical application). The process typically requires 10 years. The accumulation of basic research on mRNA technology by Karikó and her team is behind the rapid practical application of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nmRNA serves as an \'intermediate\' in the synthesis of proteins based on genetic information encoded in DNA. mRNA vaccines take advantage of this property. Instead of injecting the viral protein itself, its \'blueprint\' is injected, allowing spike proteins to be produced in human cells. The host immune system recognizes this protein and produces antibodies to fight the real virus when it enters the body.\n\nEntering the human body through a \'replacement method\' without being recognized as a foreign substance\n\nUsing mRNA to create vaccines has been around since 1990. However, mRNA is easily degraded and is often considered a foreign substance by the body, leading to strong reactions like inflammation. This made its practical application difficult.\n\nAccording to organizations such as the Nobel Foundation, Karikó and Weissman, who were researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, began their comprehensive research in 1997 to solve the problems associated with the development of mRNA vaccines. They discovered that replacing uridine (a common mRNA component) with pseudouridine (a molecule commonly present in transfer RNA [tRNA]) prevents the mRNA from being recognized as a foreign substance in the human body. The paper on this \'replacement method\' was published in 2005. The two researchers repeated countless experiments before making this discovery.\n\nAs explained by a representative from the Karolinska Institutet at the press conference, ""Dr. Karikó, who is knowledgeable on mRNA, and Dr. Weissman, who has a deep knowledge of immunology, advanced their research by complementing each other\'s expertise.""\n\nWhat background did Dr. Karikó and Dr. Weissman each have, and how did they eventually meet and come to share the same fate of achieving research results that would save many people worldwide&quest; Looking at their backgrounds again, Karikó was born in Hungary on January 17, 1955, received her PhD from the University of Szeged in Hungary in 1982, and moved to the USA in 1985 after working at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. She served as a postdoctoral fellow at Temple University in the USA and as a senior research fellow at the University of Pennsylvania before joining BioNTech in 2013. She has concurrently served as a professor at the University of Szeged and a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania since 2021.\n\nWeissman was born in the USA on September 7, 1959, graduated from Brandeis University in 1981, received his PhD in Immunology and Microbiology from Boston University in 1987, and served as an associate professor at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania before becoming a professor in 2013.\n\nKarikó, whose research was terminated in her home country, also faced hardship in the USA\n\nKarikó was awarded the Keio Medical Science Prize in 2021 and the Japan Prize in 2022. She held an online lecture at the \'Science Agora 2021\' conference organized by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) in November 2021. She visited Japan many times for award ceremonies and lectures. In her lectures and media interviews, she looked back on her research career and shared stories regarding the difficulties and hardships she experienced before achieving success in mRNA vaccine research.\n\nAccording to Karikó and documents published about her, she was born in Szolnok, a rural city in Eastern Hungary. The city was devastated by air raids during World War II. However, the city was being rebuilt by the time she was born and growing up. Nonetheless, life was not easy, as supplies were scarce during the Cold War, and there was no running water or television. However, she described her days with her parents (who ran a butcher shop) and her younger sister as ""happy."" As a teenager, she enthusiastically studied biology with her parents\' encouragement. ""I was a curious child. At the age of 16, I decided to become a scientist,"" she mentioned in her acceptance speech for the Keio Medical Science Prize. She then enrolled at the University of Szeged, a university with a long tradition and outstanding achievements, to study molecular biology in depth.\n\nShe received her PhD from the same university and continued her research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. However, in 1985, when she was 30 years old, her research funding was terminated. She searched for research opportunities in European countries and found no institutions willing to accept her. When she found that only Temple University would accept her, she decided to move to the USA with her husband, who was an engineer, and their eldest daughter, who was 2 years old at the time. With only an estimated 200,000-yen equivalent in cash, she made a ""determined journey to the USA"" without considering returning to her homeland.\n\nTaking foreign currency out of Hungary was prohibited at the time. As the story goes, she concealed the cash in her daughter\'s stuffed teddy bear to bring to her new home. Her eldest daughter became a rower in the USA. She won two consecutive gold medals as a US national rowing team member at the Olympic Games in London in 2008 and in Beijing in 2012.\n\nKarikó then moved to the University of Pennsylvania in 1989, where she met Weissman, who was working on an AIDS vaccine. Although she began in-depth research on the medical applications of mRNA, research on fragile mRNA did not gain widespread understanding. She experienced a difficult time when her grant funding was terminated. Nevertheless, she continued her research. However, even after she published a paper on mRNA vaccines in 2005, it initially did not garner much attention. Her research career was never smooth sailing.\n\nInteracting with Japanese researchers, and discoveries made by the late Dr. Yasuhiro Furuichi contribute to Karikó\'s research.\n\nDr. Karikó repeatedly mentioned Dr. Yasuhiro Furuichi in her lectures. Furuichi was a Japanese molecular biologist who passed away in October 2022 at the age of 81. Furuichi graduated from the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Toyama and received his PhD from the Graduate School of the University of Tokyo. He continued his research on mRNA at the National Institute of Genetics, where he discovered the \'cap\' structure at the tip of RNA in the mid-1970s. The structure was named after its cap-resembling shape.\n\nRNA will not function correctly without this structure. Compared with DNA studies, RNA research, especially mRNA research, has been less spectacular. However, mRNA cannot function without the cap structure, and proteins cannot be produced. For this reason, Furuichi\'s work is considered crucial and is said to have led to the practical application of mRNA vaccines. Unfortunately, Furuichi passed away last year without hearing the news of the Nobel Prize awarded to Karikó. However, he must have been pleased to see the worldwide dissemination of antiviral mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBecause of their similar research fields, Karikó had interactions with Professor Keiji Itaka, who conducts research on biofunctional restoration at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, and Professor Ken J Ishii, who specializes in immunology at the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo and is responsible for reviewing Karikó\'s papers. Osaka University posted a message on its website, stating, ""Dr. Karikó has deep connections with researchers at our university, and we at Osaka University, which has strongly promoted this research field for many years, sincerely congratulate both of the two scientists on this honor.""\n\nFurthermore, Director Emeritus/Professor Shinya Yamanaka of the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application at Kyoto University posted the following message on the Center\'s X (formerly Twitter) account: ""Congratulations on your award. I was deeply impressed after hearing that you have been persistent in your research when I had the opportunity to have a conversation with you. Your groundbreaking invention of the mRNA vaccine technology has saved many people.""\n\nMany of her close Japanese acquaintances have expressed their congratulations, and the common impressions they share are her ""friendly personality"" and ""persistence in diligently pursuing comprehensive research.""\n\nA meeting in line for the photocopier leads to discussion on \'research barriers\'\n\nAfter being selected for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2023, Karikó told the Nobel Foundation in a telephone interview, ""At first, I thought someone was making a joke."" When it became clear that it was not a mistake, she and Weissman attended a press conference at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAt a press conference, Karikó happily recounted how she met Weissman while waiting in line for a photocopier in 1997. At that time, there were few photocopiers, and the waiting time became a great opportunity to exchange information. In their research, both researchers faced a wall. ""It was nice to talk about various ideas,"" she said. ""Although our laboratories were in different buildings, it was fun to start working together.""\n\nWeissman stated, ""(When I met Dr. Karikó,) I could not get research funding, and nobody was interested in my research. Clinical trials continued to fail. However, I met her, and we worked together for the next 20 years. We never gave up and persevered in our research patiently.""\n\nWhen asked by the moderator for her advice to female students, researchers, and others following in her footsteps, Karikó replied, ""If you want to be in the spotlight, become an actress. If you want to follow orders, the military would be a good choice. However, if you enjoy solving problems, science is for you.""\n\nHigh expectations for application of vaccines to various infectious diseases and cancer treatments\n\nAt a press conference for the Japan Prize laureates, Karikó mentioned their mRNA research, stating, ""We did not originally intend to create a vaccine. Instead, we continued our research, intending to use it for pharmaceuticals. The research to develop a COVID-19 vaccine stemmed from an ethical obligation (to save those infected).""\n\nAs a result, it protected many people worldwide from COVID-19 infection or from the disease becoming more severe. The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the technology developed by Karikó and her colleagues ""played a crucial role in controlling the pandemic."" There is a high expectation that the technology they develop will have broad applications.\n\nThe Karolinska Institutet expects the technology to be applied to vaccines for malaria, influenza, and other infectious diseases, and cancer treatment. In her lecture explaining the research findings, Karikó presented research on vaccines that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells.\n\nThe institute also highly praised the achievements of the two scientists. However, at the press conference, questions were raised on the safety of mRNA vaccines. In response, a representative of the institute expressed an opinion, stating, ""13 billion people have already been vaccinated, and adverse reactions have been limited, and we do not consider them a significant concern. Actual infection with the novel coronavirus may have a higher risk of long-term health effects."" The representative further noted, ""We need to continue to explain how the mRNA vaccine works (in the body).""\n\nThe Nobel Foundation is known for not awarding any prize in the field of science to research findings that still have safety or ethical concerns. The decision to award a Nobel Prize at this time to the researchers behind the technology of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is a recognition of their safety. However, it means taking on the responsibility of awarding the Prize.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6319654/nobel-prize-awarded-to-mrna-pioneers/', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize Awarded to Work Behind COVID-19 Vaccine | TIME', 'Snippet': 'Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020.

Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020. And that success is seeding mRNA-based strategies across a number of different conditions, including other infectious diseases as well as cancer.\n\nKariko’s husband answered the call from Stockholm early in the morning on Oct. 2 at their home in a Philadelphia suburb. She told nobelprize.org that she initially thought “somebody was just joking.” While she said the conversation involved detailed scientific information that would have been hard to fake, “you never know in these days,” she said.\n\nTrue to their long-time partnership, Kariko then called Weissman to break the good news. In fact, the early morning call likely reminded him of years of similar emails he and Kariko would exchange at dawn when they were working to crack the problem of turning mRNA into reliable therapies.\n\nThat collaboration began at the copy machine between their offices at the University of Pennsylvania. Kariko was obsessed with mRNA, which is the part of DNA that codes for proteins, convinced that it would be the key to developing new treatments for heart disease, stroke and other conditions. Few scientists at the time agreed, since RNA was much less stable than DNA, and despite years of dedicated, unflagging research, Kariko had little to show in the form of results.\n\nThen came the chance meeting with Weissman at the copier in 1997. Weissman is an immunologist and physician and had come to Penn from the National Institutes of Health to continue developing a vaccine against HIV. The more gregarious Kariko tried to sell her colleague on the merits of mRNA, and Weissman listened.\n\nTo make mRNA a useful tool for treating people, however, Kariko needed to find a way to suppress its tendency to aggravate the immune system, which ended up creating a dangerous inflammatory reaction and destroying the very mRNA that was supposed to be therapeutic. Their personalities couldn\'t be more different—according to Kariko, Weissman said she tended to zig and zag to generate ideas, while he preferred the more straightforward approach. Still, “we worked side by side,"" said Weissman. But their research wasn\'t popular, either with the leadership at the university, or with the scientific community. ""We couldn’t get funding [for our research] we couldn’t get publications [for our work], we couldn’t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,” Weissman said during a press briefing after the Nobel announcement. “RNA had failed in clinical trials, and pretty much everybody had given up on it.”\n\nBut the over the next decade or so, Kariko and Weissman tenaciously proved the doubters wrong. They eventually figured out that changing one portion of the mRNA code would make it less likely to stimulate the immune system. Not only that, the change also led cells in animals to produce more of the desired protein coded for by the mRNA—exactly what they needed to turn mRNA into a robust vaccine or other treatment.\n\nBut even when the scientists published what they thought was their ground-breaking finding in 2005, the scientific community barely noticed. Doubters still prevailed, and Kariko was “kicked out from Penn, and forced to retire,” she said. Eventually, she was hired by BioNTech, a German biotech that shared Kariko’s vision about the promise of mRNA technology. When reached for comment, a spokesperson at Penn did not directly address the circumstances of Kariko\'s leaving the university.\n\nThat faith was finally borne out when two mRNA-based vaccines, including one made by BioNTech and Pfizer and another by U.S. biotech Moderna, became the first to be authorized and approved to treat SARS-CoV-2, and remain the foundation for the pandemic response. Kariko’s conviction was finally justified—more than two decades later—that mRNA would make an efficient, and potentially more powerful platform for treating disease. Now, researchers are developing mRNA-based vaccines to target other infectious diseases such as mpox and influenza, and the strategy is even showing promise against cancer, as a way to train the immune system to recognize tumors. Because the technology is still so new, scientists are still learning about any side effects of the platform—mRNA vaccines have so far been linked to a slightly higher risk of some heart inflammation, for example—but given that millions of people have received the shots, so far the benefits appear to outweigh the risks.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-10-02/kariko-weissman-mrna-covid-vaccine-nobel-prize', 'Headline': 'Scientists whose work paved way for COVID vaccines win Nobel - Los ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists whose work on mRNA paved the way for first COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel Prize.

Physician-scientist Weissman, 64, is a professor of vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nTheir work has armed scientists and drug companies with the means to turn the body’s cells into manufacturers of its own medicine.\n\n“This year’s Nobel Prize recognizes their basic science discovery that fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with the immune system and had a major impact on society during the recent pandemic,” said Rickard Sandberg, a member of the Nobel Assembly, noting that mRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 shots, “have been administered over 13 billion times.”\n\nThomas Perlmann, the secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly, said both Karikó and Weissman were “overwhelmed” when he notified them of the award, especially Karikó, given her tumultuous professional history.\n\n“Ten years ago, she told me that she was terminated from her current position and had to move to Germany for another position without her family and so forth,” Perlmann said. “So it’s been a dramatic change in her circumstances.”\n\nAlthough mRNA rose to public prominence for its use in COVID-19 vaccines, the technology is expected to become a major basis for flu vaccines, enabling shorter lead times and more accurate matching between circulating influenza strains and yearly shots.\n\nBeyond that, it could play a key role in treating sickle-cell disease and shows promise for the autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis. Its potential use in treating cancers is also opening new avenues for arming the immune system against malignancy.\n\nHIV could be the next target. Three new experimental vaccines to protect against HIV infection, all based on an mRNA design similar to that used in the COVID-19 jab, are now undergoing early human clinical trials.\n\nThe techniques pioneered by Karikó and Weissman have enabled scientists to nimbly customize the proteins targeted by vaccines, a key for thwarting shape-shifting viruses such as the coronavirus and HIV.\n\nSuch capabilities more than proved their worth during the pandemic. The mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were both designed within weeks of the release of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome, and were the first to come off manufacturing lines for worldwide use. Today, the two COVID-19 vaccines are in use in at least 164 countries, and roughly 270 million Americans have received at least one dose.\n\nThat “impressive success story” alone would make recognition of Karikó and Weissman by the Nobel Committee “proper and appropriate,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to President Biden. But advances the pair made in the use of mRNA have only begun to be felt in medicine, he added.\n\nKarikó was first introduced to ribonucleic acid, or RNA, in 1978 and said she’s been “passionate about this fragile molecule ever since.” She was exploring DNA’s use of messenger RNA to deliver specific work orders to cells when she met Weissman over a photocopy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1997.\n\nAntiretroviral medications were just entering wide use against HIV/AIDS at the time, and Weissman was trying to design a vaccine against a disease that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. He had been intrigued by the possibility that mRNA could induce cells to produce proteins that the body was missing or that it needed to heal itself. But he knew that efforts to repurpose this delicate nucleic acid for medical purposes had hit a host of stumbling blocks.\n\nKarikó was intimately familiar with the obstacles to mRNA’s use. And she was well aware of the skepticism directed its way by the scientific community. After earning a doctorate in biochemistry at Hungary’s University of Szeged and immigrating to the United States in 1985, she had been determined to find ways to harness mRNA for treatments.\n\nBy the time she met Weissman, Karikó had been an itinerant postdoctoral researcher for more than a decade. At Temple University in Philadelphia, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., and the University of Pennsylvania, she had tried to drum up support for work on mRNA’s biomedical uses. She had a drawer full of rejected grant proposals to show for it.\n\nWeissman’s research pedigree was more promising. A biochemistry major at Brandeis University, Weissman earned his medical degree and a doctorate at Boston University and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship in Fauci’s lab at the National Institutes of Health. While there, he studied a key node of the mammalian immune system — dendritic cells — and their perturbation in HIV/AIDS.\n\nWeissman knew that messenger RNA had an incidental effect on dendritic cells: Their interaction touched off an immune response that ignited dangerous inflammation across the body.\n\nWeissman and Karikó both realized that until that problem could be fixed, mRNA would be of limited biomedical use, and no use at all in making vaccines. There was also the problem of mRNA’s fragility outside of cells: Unpackaged, it was easily chewed up by enzymes, and getting it through cells’ outer walls was no picnic either.\n\nThe two scientists formed a partnership of grit and grace. Over more than two decades, Karikó’s and Weissman’s experiments shed more light on how mRNA could be repurposed to enter cells and safely order up the production of certain proteins. They watched how other nucleic acids snuck past the immune system unnoticed and devised a fix that enabled mRNA to ferry new work orders into cells without causing flares of inflammation.\n\n“Each spark of something interesting, whether a finding we expected — or even more exciting, the ones we didn’t — motivated us to continue,” Weissman said in a speech accepting the 2021 Lasker Award, one of several prestigious scientific honors the pair have won in recent years.\n\n“Together we designed and conducted experiments, often trading emails into the early hours — unable to wait until the next day to share particular findings or ideas,” Weissman said. “We just kept at it.”\n\nBy 2004, the two had produced a paper that detailed their success at reengineering mRNA for use in mammals. In an interview with the journal Cell, the two recalled that their first paper together was rejected by the three premier science journals — Cell, Science and Nature. One reviewer dismissed the work as a mere “incremental improvement” over existing research in the area.\n\nKarikó said she had to look up “incremental” in the dictionary. Undeterred, the pair got their paper published in a specialty journal, Immunity, in 2005. Then they waited for the conference invitations to pour in.\n\n“We sat and stared at the phone, and nothing happened,” Weissman said. After presenting the paper at one conference, Karikó said a fellow scientist came up and asked who had supervised her work — the kind of question no one would ask a man of her age.\n\nNot until 2010, after the pair published findings that further improved the prospects for mRNA’s use, did the medical establishment start to take notice. By 2012, Weismann and Karikó led a team that showed that mRNA, introduced into mice, could prompt the temporary production of red blood cells.\n\n“They had to do some really fancy manipulation to allow it to persist long enough” inside the body to ferry genetic instructions into cells, Fauci said. “They were persistent, resilient, and they stuck to it,” he added. “It’s a great example of the scientific process.”\n\nIn 2013, Karikó left the University of Pennsylvania to join BioNTech, reasoning that pharmaceutical companies would eclipse universities in devising treatments using mRNA technology.\n\nWhen the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in China in 2019, BioNTech had already used mRNA technology to design a vaccine against the Zika virus, which had infected hundreds of thousands of pregnant women and caused grievous birth defects across the world. Moderna, too, had been working on a Zika vaccine, as well as vaccines against cytomegalovirus infection and cancers.\n\nWithin two weeks of the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ genetic sequence, both companies had what they needed to build a vaccine. They used different formulations for the delivery of mRNA, but once inside a human cell, the vaccines provided the genetic specifications for producing harmless replicas of the coronavirus’ spike proteins. The human immune system would take it from there.\n\nWhen health officials in the U.S. and United Kingdom ordered up a new crop of COVID-19 booster shots that targeted the Omicron variant, all Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna had to do was insert a key piece of genetic code that matched the desired strains. The updated shots were ready in mere months.\n\nWeissman has established laboratories in Thailand, South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries to devise COVID-19 vaccines that can be produced locally. His research continues to explore ways for mRNA vaccines to provide more enduring protection against COVID-19 by training the immune system to recognize pieces of the virus that are much less prone to mutation.\n\nIn addition, Weissman has joined with other scientists to counter the misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 shots that has made many people unwilling to roll up their sleeves.\n\n“As important as the vaccine is, if you don’t take it, it doesn’t work,” he said in an interview Monday with nobelprize.org, adding that the endorsement from the Nobel committee might help sway some of those who have been hesitant.\n\nHe remains at the University of Pennsylvania, and is married to Mary Ellen Weissman. They have two daughters, Rachel and Allison.\n\nKarikó left BioNTech in 2022 but is still a consultant for the company. She is now a research professor at the University of Szeged and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nKarikó is married to Béla Francia, who she said encouraged her decision to commute to BioNTech in Germany when she lost her position at Penn. The couple and their daughter, Zsuzsanna “Susan” Francia, arrived in the United States in 1985 with their life savings — about $1,000 — sewn into the stuffing of a teddy bear. (Susan Francia grew up to become a decorated rower, winning two Olympic gold medals for the United States.)\n\n“I try to tell fellow female scientists that you don’t have to choose between having a family, you can have it,” she told nobelprize.org on Monday. “Your child will watch you and they will do, because that’s what counts, the example that you present.”\n\nThrough it all, Karikó has said she was not deterred by her lack of funding, the lack of interest from the medical establishment or the slow pace at which she and Weissman uncovered mRNA’s secrets.\n\n“I am so glad it helped humanity,” Karikó told a University of Pennsylvania interviewer. But for decades, the process of scientific discovery was its own reward, she added.\n\n“So many enigmatic things about RNA I find very, very exciting,” Karikó said. She and Weissman would ask questions and then design experiments to answer them.\n\n“And of course, instead of the answer, we got 100 more questions,” she added. “It was very enjoyable. I would like to emphasize that to be a scientist is a joy.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-in-medicine-awarded-to-mrna-pioneers-heres-how-their-discovery-was-integral-to-covid-vaccine-development-214763', 'Headline': 'Nobel prize in medicine awarded to mRNA pioneers – here’s how their ...', 'Snippet': 'Researchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest.

The rapid development of these vaccines changed the course of the pandemic, providing protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nBut these vaccines would not have been possible it if weren’t for the pioneering work of this year’s winners of the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine decades earlier.\n\nDr Katalin Karikó and Dr Drew Weissman, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, have been given the prestigious award for their discoveries into mRNA biology. The pair were the first to discover a way of modifying mRNA that allowed it to successfully be delivered to cells and replicated by them.\n\nTheir discovery was not only integral to COVID-19 vaccine development, but may also lead to the development of many other therapies – such as vaccines for cancer.\n\nLife’s work\n\nKarikó is a Hungarian biochemist and Weissman an American physician scientist. The two began working together in 1985 when Karikó was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, where Weissman was already working as an immunologist. They had a shared interest in how mRNA could be used to make new therapies.\n\nMessenger RNA (better known as mRNA) is an essential molecule to life. It’s made in the body from our very own DNA in a process called translation. DNA is our special encoded handbook of instructions for manufacturing proteins, which are the building blocks for material in the body.\n\nOur mRNA copies and carries these genetic instructions from our DNA to our cells. The cells then make whatever protein they’ve been instructed to, such as haemoglobin which helps red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.\n\nKarikó and Weissman thought that if it was possible to commandeer this process, mRNA could be used to instruct cells to essentially make their own cures. But at the time they started working together, attempts by other researchers to do this had been unsuccessful.\n\nThe researchers faced two major challenges as they began their work. The first was being able to prevent the host from mounting an immune response against the modified mRNA. The second was being able to deliver the mRNA into the host safely without it degrading.\n\nTo understand how they overcame the first barrier, it’s important to understand mRNA’s structure. Normally, mRNA molecules contain four types of smaller molecules known as bases (nucleosides): A (adenine), U (uridine), G (guanine), and C (cytosine). Different sequences of these bases can be strung together to produce the basis of an mRNA molecule.\n\nIn early experiments, Karikó and Weismann found that injecting normal mRNA molecules into mice led to an immune response. This meant the mouse’s immune system saw the new mRNA as an invading pathogen and the immune cells would destroy it, instead of replicating it.\n\nSo the researchers modified the U nucleoside to create a pseudouridine, a chemical compound which stabilises RNA’s structure. When they repeated their experiment with the modified mRNA, the mice exhibited no immune response.\n\nBut Karikó and Weismann still faced the second challenge of being able to deliver the bespoke mRNA without it degrading.\n\nThey decided to use lipids (a nanoparticle) to deliver it. These fatty chemical compounds are an essential part of the cell membrane, controlling what enters and leaves the cell. Specially created lipids allowed the mRNA molecules to be delivered without being degraded or broken down by the immune system.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s research had successfully eliminated the obstacles that had previously stood in the way of using mRNA clinically. Being able to instruct the body to replicate virtually any harmless protein could have potential for treating a range of diseases and even protect against viral infections.\n\nCOVID vaccines\n\nWhen their research was first published, it didn’t garner much attention. But in 2011, two biotech companies – Moderna and BioNTech – took notice and began research into mRNA medicines.\n\nIt’s no wonder why. Traditional vaccine production methods are time consuming, expensive and don’t work for every vaccine. But Karikó and Weissman’s work showed that synthetic mRNA could be made at a large scale.\n\nResearchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest. But in 2020, when COVID-19 began spreading around the globe, vaccines were needed quickly to offer protection.\n\nUsing the foundational work of Karikó and Weissman, scientists developed a bespoke mRNA sequence which mimicked the spike protein (which allows the virus to enter our cells). This produced a harmless COVID particle which our cells then replicated, allowing our bodies to protect us from severe COVID infections when it encountered the real virus.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s discoveries years earlier were critical in making the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines possible. But these aren’t the only ways their work could be applied.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/nobel-prize-medicine-1.6984244', 'Headline': 'Scientists who spurred development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving ...', 'Full_text': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries they made at the University of Pennsylvania that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving body said on Monday.\n\nKariko and Weissman were honoured for ""their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19,"" the body said.\n\n""MRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 vaccines, have been administered over 13 billion times.

The first awards were given out in 1901.\n\nKey development in 2005\n\nKariko was senior vice-president and head of RNA protein replacement at BioNTech until 2022 and has since acted as an adviser to the company. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania\'s Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nWeissman is professor in vaccine research at the Perelman School.\n\nThe two have said they met and began chatting in 1998 while waiting for rationed photocopying machine time.\n\n""Maybe you have some more copy machines now,"" Kariko said at UPenn on Monday. ""I bragged about how I can do RNA, and Drew was interested in vaccines, and that is how our collaboration started.""\n\nKariko found a way to prevent the immune system from launching an inflammatory reaction against lab-made mRNA, previously seen as a major hurdle against any therapeutic use of mRNA.\n\nTogether with Weissman, she showed in 2005 that adjustments to nucleosides, the molecular letters that write the mRNA\'s genetic code, can keep the mRNA under the immune system\'s radar.\n\n""We couldn\'t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,"" Weissman said on Monday. ""Pretty much everybody gave up on it.""\n\nMessenger or mRNA, discovered in 1961, is a natural molecule that serves as a recipe for the body\'s production of proteins.\n\nThe technology breaks from established biotech medicines, generated in complex reactors by genetically modified living cells, then isolated and purified. Messenger RNA, by contrast, works like a software that can be injected into the body to instruct human cells to churn out the desired proteins. Prospective uses include drugs against cancer and vaccines against malaria, influenza and rabies.\n\nPfizer, in partnership with BioNTech, and Moderna were able to develop mRNA vaccines based on the foundational work conducted by Kariko and Weissman, as well as other scientists, enabling a rapid response as a COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization in mid-March 2020.\n\nSince that time, a vocal anti-vaccine movement has emerged. Olle Kämpe of the Karolinska Institute, responding to a reporter question, said the award would probably not sway those most resistant to receiving vaccines, but that, ""giving a Nobel Prize for this COVID-19 vaccine may make hesitant people take the vaccine and be sure it\'s very efficient and safe.""\n\nGunilla Karlsson Hedestam, also from the institute, said scientists must be transparent and communicate clearly to wider audiences. While the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines were accelerated, she said, it was important for people to undertstand that the origins of the work enabling the development of mRNA vaccines date back to the 1990s.\n\nSir Andrew Pollard, an immunology professor at Oxford University who pursued a different technology when co-developing the lesser-used COVID vaccine by AstraZeneca, said it was ""absolutely right that the ground-breaking work"" done by Kariko and Weissman should be recognized by the Nobel committee.\n\nPeace Prize revealed on Friday\n\nPrizes in physics, chemistry and literature will be announced this week, with the Nobel Peace Prize winner to be revealed on Friday. The economics prize is announced on Oct. 9.\n\nWinners of this year\'s Nobel Prizes will get an extra 1 million crowns compared to last year, partly because the Swedish crown has lost around 30 per cent of its value against the euro the past decade.

Usually, the award is unrelated to current events, too. This year, however, the jury took the opposite route. On Monday, October 2, the Hungarian scientist Katalin Kariko, Vice President of BioNTech, and American scientist Drew Weissman, Professor of Vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania were awarded for their decisive contribution to the development of the messenger RNA vaccine. In other words, the jury awarded a woman and a man, both in their sixties – almost toddlers in the ranking – less than three years after the first use of this revolutionary technology.\n\nMeanwhile, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna\'s messenger RNA vaccines have turned the world of research and healthcare upside down. In fact, they turned the world upside down. In the international race to immunize against Covid-19, these newcomers outstripped all previous technologies – inactivated or attenuated viruses, recombinant proteins, and viral vectors. In ten months, the two laboratories developed safe, protective vaccines. With an efficiency of 95% against the initial strain of the virus, they have even outperformed all their competitors. In Western countries, notably North America and Europe, they account for the overwhelming majority of doses administered. Without taking the slightest risk, we can therefore assert that the more than 13 billion injections of messenger RNA vaccines already carried out have made it possible to avoid an even deadlier catastrophe.\n\nThe two scientists have already garnered a fine crop of awards. These include the Breakthrough Prize – the most endowed – the highly prestigious Princess of Asturias Prize and the prestigious Lasker Prize. The French Academy of Sciences also awarded its grand medal to Katalin Kariko. All that was missing was the laurels from the Swedish Academy, which everyone had been promising them for two years. Now they have them.\n\nRevolutionary puzzle\n\nBut beware of false evidence. ""People should know that this wasn\'t just a one-off experiment that we did and the vaccine was made in 10 months,"" Drew Weissman told the New York Times. ""We did the modified mRNA and we are getting the honors, but the vaccines are based on 20-plus years of work by Kati and I and work by hundreds if not thousands of other scientists."" The prize list thus leaves in the shade those who came before, such as Americans Robert Malone and Philip Felgner, the first to have shown, in 1990, that a mixture of messenger RNA and fats could enter cells and produce proteins.

We used latent class growth analysis to determine patterns (or classes) of pandemic-related food insecurity during a 1-year period.\n\nResults\n\nWe found 10 classes of trajectories of food insecurity, including 1 class of consistent food security (64.7%), 1 class of consistent food insecurity (3.4%), 5 classes of decreasing food insecurity (15.8%), 2 classes of increasing food insecurity (4.6%), and 1 class of stable but elevated food insecurity (11.6%). Relative to the class that remained food secure, other classes were younger, had a greater proportion of women, and tended to identify with a racial or ethnic minority group.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe found heterogeneous longitudinal patterns in the development, resolution, or persistence of food insecurity during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences of food insecurity were highly variable across the US population, with one-third experiencing some form of food insecurity risk. Findings have implications for identifying population groups who are at increased risk of food insecurity and related health disparities beyond the first year of the pandemic.\n\nTop\n\nIntroduction\n\nFood insecurity — which occurs when access to adequate food to live a healthy life is limited by a lack of money or other resources — is a major public health problem in the US that contributes substantially to the burden of chronic disease and poor mental health (1). Food insecurity results in an estimated $77 billion each year in excess health care spending (2). More than 1 in 10 US households experienced food insecurity in 2020 (3). The Healthy People 2020 goal was to reduce the national prevalence of food insecurity to 6%, and this is now the target for Healthy People 2030 (4).\n\nAlong with illness and death in the US (5) and globally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a cascade of economic and social disruptions that increased food insecurity, particularly in its earliest months (6). Data from the US Census Household Pulse Survey showed that food insufficiency (a severe form of food insecurity) rose from 8% in March 2020 to 10% in June 2020 (7). Some households, such as Black and Hispanic or Latino households and households with children, were found to be more vulnerable than other households to food insecurity as a result of the pandemic (3,7). In addition to these national prevalence studies, other studies have estimated food insecurity to be much higher in some samples (8,9); these studies differed in sample representation (online convenience vs community-based samples), study design (cross-sectional vs longitudinal), and food insecurity measures (single vs multiple items) (3,6–9).\n\nThe growing body of evidence shows that experiences of COVID-19 pandemic–related food insecurity varied substantially across the US population. However, most epidemiologic studies cross-sectionally assessed food insecurity during a reference period (eg, the previous 12 months) and did not follow respondents over time to examine variability of experiences during that time. This is an important research gap, because most households with food insecurity tend to experience episodic rather than chronic food insecurity (10). Few studies have characterized the variability of food insecurity over time (11). Measurement of the timing of food insecurity in a more granular fashion has led to important public health and clinical outcomes, including increased use of emergency departments and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia at the end of the month versus earlier weeks of the month based on claims data (12).\n\nThe objective of our study was to characterize the heterogeneity in food insecurity during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified trajectories through repeated measures data that assessed the probability food insecurity every 2 weeks in a nationally representative US sample. Characterizing the heterogeneity in food insecurity during this pivotal period is important to inform public health efforts to reduce food insecurity and its associated health harms, to monitor the impact of food insecurity–related policies, and to prioritize efforts designed for populations at greatest risk of persistent food insecurity.\n\nTop\n\nMethods\n\nData source and sampling\n\nWe used publicly available and deidentified data from the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative panel study of approximately 9,500 adult respondents conducted by the Center for Economic and Social Research at the University of Southern California. Launched in 2014, UAS is an internet panel study that uses an address-based probability sampling strategy and provides internet-connected tablets to respondents to minimize the effects of the digital divide for online survey completion. Each survey of the UAS is approved by the University of Southern California human subjects committee internal review board. In March 2020, UAS launched the Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, a longitudinal series of surveys that assessed economic and health-related indicators during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were administered every 2 weeks from March 10, 2020, through March 30, 2021, then monthly through July 20, 2021.\n\nFor this study, we analyzed data from waves 2 through 25, or April 1, 2020, through March 30, 2021, because these waves occurred during the first year of the pandemic and had consistent measures of food insecurity. A total of 8,425 unique participants responded to at least 1 survey during the study period. We excluded participants from analysis if they did not complete more than 1 survey (n = 429) or did not provide at least 2 waves of responses to the food insecurity measures (n = 52), yielding a total sample of 7,944 unique respondents. On average, these respondents completed 21.3 (SD, 4.7) waves for a total of 148,392 surveys. Of these surveys, 98.6% (n = 146,265) had responses to food insecurity measures. Participants provided informed consent before completing their first survey either electronically or on paper. More information on the survey methodology and sampling can be found at https://uasdata.usc.edu.\n\nMeasures\n\nFood insecurity. Three survey items were adapted from the US Department of Agriculture’s US Household Food Security Survey (13), designed to assess food insecurity in the previous 12 months. Understanding Coronavirus in America survey respondents were asked the following questions in reference to the past 7 days: 1) “Were you worried you would run out of food because of a lack of money or other resources?” 2) “Did you eat less than you thought you should because of a lack of money or other resources?” and 3) “Did you go without eating for a whole day because of a lack of money or other resources?” Answer choices were yes, no, or unsure. For the 3 questions, unsure accounted for 2.6%, 2.1%, and 1.4% of responses, respectively. Given prior research on social desirability bias when assessing food insecurity (14) and the small number of unsure responses, we considered yes and unsure to be affirmative responses. In total, 8.9% of surveys were affirmative for item 1, 7.9% for item 2, and 4.2% for item 3. We coded food insecurity status (binary outcome) as affirmative (yes or unsure) to any of the 3 items.\n\nSociodemographic characteristics. Sociodemographic characteristics were age, binary sex, marital status, race (White or Caucasian [hereinafter White], Black or African American, Native American/American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian/Asian American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, mixed), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino), educational attainment, annual household income, employment status, receipt of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, household composition (no children in household vs children in household), and US Census Bureau–designated geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West). Sociodemographic factors are based on responses to participants’ first survey, collected from April 1, 2020, through March 2, 2021.\n\nAnalysis\n\nWe used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) (15) to identify clusters of people (ie, latent classes) based on variability in their binary response of any food insecurity over time. LCGA is a longitudinal clustering technique that uses latent (unobserved) variables (16,17) and has similarities to other trajectory modeling techniques, including latent growth mixture modeling, but LCGA does not allow for within-class variation in trajectories (18). Classes identified by LCGA are not known a priori and are determined empirically, but because a substantial proportion of survey participants were observed to have no change in food insecurity status over time, we assigned them to either a class that remained food secure or a class that remained insecure throughout the study period (n = 5,317) (19).\n\nWe estimated a trajectory shape for each class, and participants (n = 2,627) were assigned to latent classes according to their posterior probabilities (20). The 1-class solution was first specified, which was then used as a comparison for solutions of increasing class size until the best solution was identified. To identify the optimal number of classes, we evaluated statistical indices and tests and parameter estimates, including likelihood ratio tests, such as the Vuong–Lo–Mendell–Rubin test and Lo–Mendell–Rubin adjusted test, entropy, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), sample-size adjusted BIC, corrected AIC for small sample sizes, and assessment of class cell sizes (16) (Supplemental Table 1 in Appendix). We created a graph in Excel (Microsoft Corporation) of the average probability of endorsing food insecurity at each time within each cluster.\n\nThe food insecurity outcome was binary and represented any affirmative indication of food insecurity. We therefore relied on a commonly used approach for a latent variable model for a binary outcome, which was to assume that a normally distributed latent variable (food insecurity*) exists, from which participants respond affirmatively when the latent variable exceeds some threshold (16). That is, in these models, for individual i across time points\n\nFood Insecurityi = Yes if τ < Food Insecurityi*\n\nwhere τ is the threshold parameter.\n\nThe interpretation of the model coefficients in our LCGA followed from probit analyses. That is, within each cluster, the model coefficient for the linear slope is the change in the z score of a normal distribution for a 1-unit change in time. We assumed linear growth in food insecurity after evaluating descriptive plots and generalized estimating equations models of the longitudinal data in the entire sample. We used the MLR option in Mplus to estimate the model (21), which uses maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters but uses a robust sandwich-type estimator (Huber–White sandwich estimator) to calculate SEs (22). Robust approaches are resistant to errors under small violations of parametric assumptions. Our model also effectively handled ignorable missing data dependent on the data in hand (ie, following a missing-at-random assumption) via full information maximum likelihood. As a result, participants with missing data could still be included in the trajectory analysis for unbiased inference. In total, 80.0% of surveys were completed by all participants with responses to food insecurity questions. We examined sociodemographic factors across each trajectory for descriptive purposes in post hoc analyses.\n\nWe defined α = .05 for our level of significance in all statistical tests, which were 2-tailed. We conducted LCGA in Mplus version 8.6 (21). We used R program in the R studio environment (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) for data management and graphic displays, and we used the MplusAutomation package to automate LCGA estimation and interpretation (23). Sample weights were not included in the LCGA but were used to calculate summary statistics and summarize sociodemographic characteristics, which were calculated by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).\n\nTop\n\nResults\n\nApproximately two-thirds (60.0%) of the sample at first survey were aged 18 to 50 years (Table 1). Just over half of the sample identified as female (53.9%), were married (53.4%), and were currently working (57.2%). The proportion of self-identified race and ethnicity in this sample generally mirrored the overall US population; for race, 75.9% identified as White only, 13.0% as Black only, and 5.6% as Asian only. For ethnicity, 19.1% identified as Hispanic/Latino. Approximately one-third had a bachelor’s degree or more (33.8%), earned more than $75,000 annually (34.4%), had children in the household (34.7%), and were living in the South (38.8%).\n\nFood insecurity trajectories\n\nIn the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020, the prevalence of any food insecurity was as high as 20.4%. The prevalence decreased to 8.9% by March 2021, with most of the decline occurring in the early months, before leveling off in mid-2020 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPrevalence of any food insecurity among respondents (N = 7,944) to the Understanding America Study, Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, April 2020 through March 2021. Shading indicates 95% CIs. [A tabular version of this figure is available.]\n\nWe identified 10 unique trajectories of food insecurity (Figure 2), including the 2 trajectories that were empirically assigned (remained food secure and remained food insecure). Each trajectory can be described by the shape of its curve: 3 trajectories showed little change (remained insecure, remained elevated, and remained secure), 2 trajectories indicated a high probability of initial food insecurity followed by a precipitous decline (named “initial shock 1” and “initial shock 2”), 3 trajectories with a high probability of initial food insecurity followed by a steady state of decline (named “recovering 1,” “recovering 2,” and “recovering 3”), and 2 trajectories with a relatively low probability of initial food insecurity followed by a steady state of incline (named “became insecure 1” and “became insecure 2”).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nProbability of experiencing food insecurity among respondents (N = 7,944) to the Understanding America Study, Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, April 2020 through March 2021. Three categories (remained secure, remained insecure, and remained elevated) were characterized as consistent. Two categories (initial shock 1 and initial shock 2) were characterized by a rapid decline in food insecurity status between March and July 2020. Three categories (recovering 1, recovering 2, and recovering 3) were defined as having experienced food insecurity initially, with the likelihood steadily declining during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two categories (became insecure 1 and became insecure 2) were defined as steadily becoming food insecure during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Abbreviation: FDA, Food and Drug Administration. [A tabular version of this figure is available.]\n\nAlthough most (64.7%) of the US-representative sample was in the “remained secure” category, 35.3% experienced some form of food insecurity (with 3.4% remaining insecure) during the first year of the pandemic (Table 2). Within that 35.3%, we found much variability. In addition to the 2 groups whose food security/insecurity status did not change, another group showed minimal changes: this group was mostly food secure during the study period but had an elevated prevalence of food insecurity, beginning at 13.6% in April 2020 and ending at 7.5% in March 2021. This group, “remained elevated,” comprised 11.6% of the study population.\n\nFive groups experienced some early form of food insecurity, but their probability of being food insecure declined over time. Two such trajectories, initial shock 1 (4.6% of the study population) and initial shock 2 (3.2% of the study population), appear to have briefly experienced food insecurity. This experience may have been largely related to the initial economic shutdowns in the earliest months of the pandemic in 2020, wherein states and municipalities issued stay-at-home or lockdown orders to mitigate the spread of the virus. These 2 trajectories are distinguished by the length of time needed for food insecurity to be resolved. Participants classified as initial shock 1 took about 16 weeks to resolve, while initial shock 2 was resolved within 8 weeks.\n\nThree groups took longer to recover from food insecurity experienced earlier in the pandemic: “recovering 1” (4.3%) ended the first year at a slightly elevated probability of food insecurity, while “recovering 2” (2.6%) and “recovering 3” (1.1%) had a similar rate or slope of recovery but a different initial probability of food insecurity.\n\nThe probability of becoming food insecure increased during the first year of the pandemic for 2 groups. These 2 trajectories, “became insecure 1” (3.1%) and “became insecure 2” (1.5%), had nearly the same rate or slope of becoming food insecure but their initial probability of food insecurity differed.\n\nAlthough small sample sizes and corresponding wide 95% CIs in some groups precluded a statistical comparison of sociodemographic characteristics across trajectories, characteristics appeared to differ in several ways (Supplemental Table 2A and 2B in Appendix). Those who remained food secure, compared with those in other trajectories, tended to be older, self-identified as White, and had a greater income at first interview.\n\nTop\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study is among the first to describe population-level longitudinal patterns in the development, resolution, or persistence of food insecurity during a key time of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing heterogeneity in food insecurity experiences during this period. Notably, one-third of the population was found to experience any food insecurity when assessed longitudinally, whether food insecurity existed from the start and persisted (for approximately 15%), improved (for approximately 16%), or worsened (for approximately 5%). With careful attention to not overextend the findings of this initial study, we also observed that certain patterns of food insecurity corresponded with pivotal periods during the first year of the pandemic, starting with abrupt and widespread economic shutdowns in the earliest months. We found 2 patterns of food insecurity that occurred mainly in the earliest months of the pandemic before resolving relatively shortly thereafter (ie, initial shock 1 and initial shock 2). Therefore, an important consideration raised by our findings relates to the definition and measurement of food insecurity when accounting for the many factors that drive food insecurity.\n\nWhile food insecurity at the individual level occurs when access to adequate food is limited or uncertain because of a lack of money or other resources (13), the pillars of food security in a global context also include availability, use, and stability (24). The pandemic introduced a host of other factors described elsewhere (ie, business and school closures, supply chain issues, and stockpiling of groceries and resulting shortages) (6,25) that affected experiences of food insecurity for reasons beyond a person’s lack of access caused by money. Our findings, particularly data on the initial shock 1 and initial shock 2 groups, may speak to food insecurity experiences that were driven more by societal disruptions than by economic or financial uncertainty at the individual level. For instance, while worrying about running out of food before being able to buy more is a key screening question for food insecurity (14), affirmative responses to this question could have also been driven by factors that go beyond having enough money for food. That respondents in the initial shock 2 group appeared to share similar sociodemographic characteristics with respondents in the group that remained food secure raises new considerations in defining and measuring food insecurity in the context of a novel global pandemic.\n\nSeveral patterns of food insecurity described here, such as the one for people who remained food insecure during the entire study period, are particularly concerning. Because nearly half of those in the remained insecure group were SNAP recipients at the outset of the study period, this group may represent a small but important population for whom existing food insecurity protection policies were already not sufficient or whose food insecurity was not being adequately addressed before the pandemic. Groups that showed increases in the probability of food insecurity over time also warrant attention; 2 groups, “became insecure 1” and “became insecure 2,” were worse off 1 year after the onset of the pandemic than at the beginning. Although small sample sizes preclude us from making reliable sociodemographic comparisons, findings suggest that the initial probability of food insecurity distinguished the trajectories of these 2 groups.\n\nSeveral lessons can be learned from populations that experienced food insecurity early in the pandemic but either recovered entirely or were headed toward recovery 1 year later. In studies of food insecurity after other large-scale and highly disruptive events, such as Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana (26) and Hurricane Harvey in Texas (27), findings highlighted several sociodemographic characteristics as protective factors (ie, income, partner status) and risk factors (ie, low levels of social support, poor physical or mental health, female sex/gender) for remaining food insecure in the year(s) after the events. Notably absent in the literature is substantive longitudinal research on the impact of recovery policies. Given the wide berth of policies implemented in the US in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial opportunity exists to explore how these policies, such as those directly aimed at reducing food insecurity or unemployment, may have contributed to each trajectory to identify what aspects of each policy either contributed to recovery or inhibited it.\n\nA wealth of research demonstrates the relationship among income, employment status, and food insecurity. However, the confluence of various local, state, and federal responses to the pandemic provides a unique microcosm for examining a more direct impact on food insecurity. One multisite analysis found that food insecurity was highest during the pandemic among those who experienced job disruptions (28). The initial expiration of unemployment insurance at the federal level at the end of July 2020, along with the general uncertainty about its extension or even the future COVID-19 landscape, likely played a role in the upward trend in overall food insecurity observed around August 2020 (29,30). Further work in this area may entail examining how the economic impact of business closures and unemployment insurance claims (31) may have affected trajectories of food insecurity. For instance, researchers could examine the association of food insecurity trajectories with the comparative efficiency with which states implemented unemployment policies. Furthermore, research using other data sources would be necessary to examine the influence of policies such as the expanded child tax credit.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur study has several limitations. Measures of food insecurity were examined only during the first year of the pandemic and did not account for food insecurity experienced before the pandemic nor their trajectory as the pandemic extended beyond March 2021. This study also assumed that all LCGA model assumptions were met in this sample for valid inference (ie, within-class multivariate normality) (32). We did perform more robust inference in case model parametric assumptions that were violated. Another limitation is that in our chosen 10-class solution, some classes had small cell sizes, and the entropy values and some of the averages of posterior probability of membership were low (2 clusters had an average posterior probability of membership below the threshold of 0.70 considered as a general guideline for adequate assignment accuracy) (33). Thus, we chose as our selection criteria global model fit and thorough interpretability of the possible clustering in this data (ie, more clusters, each unique in characteristic) over a more precise solution involving fewer classes. The small sample sizes in some classes preclude formal comparisons of sociodemographic differences across classes, although we note that those who remained food secure tended to belong to historically advantaged sociodemographic groups, whereas racial and ethnic minority populations were more likely to experience other trajectories of food insecurity (34). Across the 10 classes that were identified here, the group least vulnerable to food insecurity — remained secure — had the highest proportion of respondents who self-identified as White, earned an annual income exceeding $75,000 per year, and had completed a bachelor’s degree or more.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur findings highlighted population-level heterogeneity in the experience of food insecurity in the US throughout the first year of the pandemic, particularly in demonstrating the large variability of population response to the pandemic in food insecurity experiences. These initial findings have implications for identifying population groups who are at increased risk of food insecurity and food-insecurity–related health disparities beyond the first year of the pandemic, with particular attention to those whose risk remained high, remained elevated, or increased over time. The findings here also provide an opportunity and suggest a need for public health researchers to take a more granular look at how policies may have affected food insecurity during the first year of the pandemic.\n\nTop\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe project described in this article relies on data from survey(s) administered by the UAS, which is maintained by the Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) at the University of Southern California (USC).

The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A quality adjusted life year is one year of life in perfect health.\n\nThe study, published in PLOS One, should not be used to justify more lockdown measures, Yakusheva said. Nor is it a retroactive endorsement of the strict economic lockdown approach the United States imposed during the first six months of the pandemic.\n\n“We evaluated the full packet of public health measures as it was implemented in the beginning of the pandemic, but lesser mitigation measures may have worked just as well to reduce lives lost,” Yakusheva said. “The fact is, we just will never know. At the time, we had to work with the information that we had. We knew the pandemic was deadly, and we did not have therapeutics or a vaccine.”\n\nThe situation has changed dramatically since the pandemic began, and we have more tools to battle the virus, Yakusheva said. Vaccines and therapeutics are available, as are other mitigation measures.\n\nThis is the first known paper to measure the effect of pandemic lockdown mitigation measures on lives saved and lost, as opposed to typical economic evaluations, which examine the cost per life saved, she said.\n\n“This is tough for people to agree upon. Typically, people are in one of two camps — pragmatics who worry about the economy and ethicists who say any amount of money is worth saving a life,” Yakusheva said. “Some value loved ones more, or their own lives. It’s very subjective.\n\n“What we did was look at empirical correlations between loss of income and mortality, and created a range of estimates on how many people could be expected to die as a result of the downturn, which is essentially the estimated collateral damage of the public health measures. What our analysis did was to allow us an apples-to-apples comparison of lives saved vs. lives lost.”\n\nThere are important study limitations. Chief among them are that some answers to major questions were unobserved — for instance, how many lives would have been lost had COVID-19 been unmitigated. In other words, if it had just run its course with no public health measures in place.\n\n“We know how many people died with public health measures in place, but we can’t know how many people would have died without those measures in place,” Yakusheva said.\n\nThe team estimated that number based on published literature, and the accuracy of that literature, or the public’s behavior, could lead to an over or underestimate.\n\nAlso, all of the human toll of the lockdown won’t be seen immediately. For example, the health toll could manifest later as disease progression because someone who was unemployed couldn’t buy medications.\n\n“We tried to be very careful and produced a range of numbers of lives potentially saved and lost, and we hope the true numbers lie within those ranges,” Yakusheva said.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/food-insecurity-in-the-time-of-covid', 'Headline': 'Food Insecurity in the Time of COVID - Johns Hopkins', 'Snippet': 'Even before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted food supplies, health systems, and global nutrition programs, 800 million around the world were undernourished (supplied with less than the minimum amount of the nutrients or foods essential for sound health and growth).

Children were especially vulnerable: 144 million children under five were stunted (low height-for-age). 47 million children were affected by wasting, a life-threatening form of malnutrition.\n\nAs nutrition policy expert Rebecca Heidkamp and co-authors wrote in a Nature study, “the world was already not on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2—to eliminate hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.”\n\nThe goal of their study was to model the potential short- and long-term impacts the pandemic would have on nutrition and recommend policies to mitigate damage.\n\nWith modeling tools, they were able to determine potential impacts under optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenarios from 2020 to 2022. One big challenge was that the pandemic itself interfered with capturing critical data—in this case, an exact count of wasted and stunted children.\n\n“We’ve been struggling to know what the actual impacts have been,” says Heidkamp, PhD, an associate scientist in International Health who specializes in developing nutrition policy in low- and middle-income countries. At the start of the pandemic, UN agencies, including WHO and UNICEF, were dependent on phone surveys to collect data. This meant researchers “couldn’t go out and actually measure women and children,” she says, and “that’s what we care about in nutrition.”\n\nThe study points to evidence from phone surveys in Asia and Africa revealing disruptions in food supply chains and a spike in food prices resulted in dramatic increases in poverty and food insecurity in 2020, forcing families to shift to poorer diets.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, countries like India and Brazil have adapted and scaled up government assistance programs and social safety net programs, such as social protection and cash and food transfers, but public health experts predict these efforts will be insufficient to return to living standards seen prior to the pandemic.\n\nStanding Together for Nutrition: A Trusted, Unified Voice\n\nEarly in the pandemic, lockdowns especially posed a threat to global nutrition efforts, including the disbursement of iron supplements through prenatal care for pregnant people at high risk of anemia; food assistance for families, such as staples like flour, cereal, beans, and lentils; and routine interventions to prevent and treat acute malnutrition. In addition, school closures halted school feeding programs.\n\nThe crisis led to the creation of a research and advocacy consortium involving several Bloomberg School faculty including Heidkamp, called Standing Together for Nutrition, or ST4N.\n\nThe group includes nutrition, economics, and food and health systems experts. Their goal: to identify the potential impacts of COVID—and now the war in Ukraine—on food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries, and ultimately recommend nutrition interventions to mitigate excess stunting and child mortality.\n\n“Now rising costs of products used to treat malnutrition are threatening to interrupt those programs as they cannot reach as many, even as the need goes up,” says Heidkamp.\n\nThe study reports that in 2019, the UN World Food Programme estimated that 150 million people in 81 different countries needed food assistance. In February of 2022, it rose to 276 million people. The agency predicts that number to increase to 323 million this year alone.\n\nHeidkamp anticipates that 2022 will be a big advocacy year for nutrition. “There are many challenges as we look ahead. … but we need to keep shining the light on these issues and figure out who the right global players will be,” she says.\n\nIn the Nature piece, Heidkamp and co-authors urge “governments, donors, and the UN to help prevent a major exacerbation of malnutrition.” They recommend succinct steps these players must take to build more sustainable food systems that can help support affordable and nutritious diets for all:\n\nEnd trade restrictions that affect access to nutrition.\n\nSustain or implement social protection programs.\n\nProtect national nutrition budgets.\n\nHonor commitments already made.\n\nMobilize more resources for humanitarian assistance.\n\nHeidkamp says it’s donors and affluent groups like the World Bank that have the power to strongly influence other countries toward ending trade restrictions, implementing social protection programs, and activating humanitarian assistance in order to end food insecurity and malnutrition.\n\nGrace Fernandez is a communications and marketing specialist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nRELATED:'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/26/business/global-poverty-covid-pandemic-intl-hnk/index.html', 'Headline': 'Covid-induced poverty: Nearly 100 million people may stay poor this ...', 'Snippet': 'The World Bank estimates that 97 million people across the globe fell into poverty due to the pandemic in 2020, living on less than $2 a day.

But he was dismissed as a “Dhaka man,” who wouldn’t be able to cope in harsh weather conditions, recounted his wife.\n\nAbove all, “food was the biggest problem,” said20-year-old Dipali Roy, who was pregnant at the time and sometimes could only have one meal a day through a public rationing program. “I didn’t know what to do … We would just have to sit and wait when they would bring food.”\n\n2020 led to a historic setback in the fight against global poverty, with the number of the world’s poorest rising for the first time in over 20 years, according to the World Bank.\n\nCarolina Sánchez-Páramo, global director of poverty and equity at the World Bank, likened the pandemic to a natural disaster that would quickly spread beyond its epicenter in East Asia.\n\n“We knew the tsunami was coming,” she told CNN Business.\n\n“The question was not if this [economic shock] was going to reach the other developing regions, but when.”\n\nRising inequality\n\nEven as tens of millions of people were being pushed into destitution, the ultra-rich becamewealthier.Last year, billionaires enjoyed the highest boost to their share of wealth on record, according to the World Inequality Lab.\n\nAnd while it took just nine months for the world’s 1,000 richest people to reclaim their fortunes during the pandemic, it could be more than a decade before the least fortunate recover, according to Oxfam International’s annual inequality report, released in January.\n\nShameran Abed, executive director of BRAC International, a nonprofit that works to alleviate poverty across Asia and Africa, pointed to the widening wealth gap, saying that “the world’s three richest people” could likely wipe out ultra poverty on Earth.\n\n“It’s not their responsibility alone,” he added. “But I’m just saying that generally there’s enough resources [to tackle the problem].”\n\nRecently, the top 1% has been under pressure to pitch in on humanitarian issues.\n\nIn November, the director of the United Nations’ World Food Programme called on billionaires including the world’s two richest men, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, to “step up now, on a one-time basis.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Becky Anderson, David Beasley said that giving $6 billion, or about 2% of Musk’s net worth, could help solve world hunger.\n\n“[It’s] $6 billion to help 42 million people that are literally going to die if we don’t reach them. It’s not complicated,” he added.\n\nThe call-out got a direct response from Musk, who later said on Twitter that if the organization could lay out “exactly how” the funding would solve the issue, he would “sell Tesla stock right now and do it.”\n\nThe Tesla (TSLA) CEO did not publicly respond when the UN released a plan in November.\n\nWhat’s needed now\n\nAbed, who recently worked with members of parliament in the United Kingdom to declare an “emergency” on the issue, argues that “poverty is a policy choice.”\n\n“We have the know-how to pull large amounts of people out of poverty,” said the nonprofit leader, whose team helped the Roys with a loan that the couple said got them back on their feet.\n\n“There’s plenty of evidence of what works, what doesn’t work.”\n\nExperts say the first task is to concentrate on vaccinations.\n\n“We need to make sure that everybody has access to vaccines or some sort of treatment for the pandemic, because till you manage to control the health shock, it’s very hard to think about economic recovery right?” said Sánchez-Páramo. “That’s almost like a necessary condition for anything else to happen.”\n\nVaccine inequality has become a major issue as many of the world’s richest countries hoard shots, buying up enough doses to vaccinate their populations several times over and failing to deliver on their promises to share them with the developing world.\n\nAnd as governments continue to rebuild, theyshould also focus on reactivating economic activity that would generate employment, such as in the service sector, according to Sánchez-Páramo.\n\nOver the past two years, governments around the world have rolled out stimulus packages to help prop up their respective economies.\n\nSánchez-Páramo noted that while many have since come under “fiscal pressure” over how much they spent, it was important not to roll back safety net programs too quickly.\n\n“They [should] wait for employment to recover before they withdraw income support from some of these more vulnerable households,” she said.\n\n“Because if we consolidate and roll back the support too quickly, we may actually see a second wave of increases in poverty because the employment is not yet there.”\n\nGlimmers of hope\n\nBack in Bangladesh, the Roys are having better days.\n\nAfter securing a loan of 40,000 taka ($466), the couple purchased a van and a goat to support themselves, they said.\n\nPradip Roy now works as driver with his van, ferrying passengers for the equivalent of about $6 a day. He said the family has no plans to return to the city, and is now saving up to buy a cow and some agricultural land.\n\nWhile the two have technically climbed out of poverty, the hardships of the coronavirus crisis have made their mark.\n\nDipali Roy, who described the pangs of hunger while she was pregnant as “the most painful” time of her life, said “if I think back to, or remember those times, my heart bursts with tears.”\n\n“But now we are having very good days,” she added, saying that she had regained hope for the future, and dreams that their six-month-old son will go on to get a master’s degree.\n\nStill, they have a reminder for the international community: do not forget those still left behind.\n\n“There are a lot of people like us who fell to the bottom,” said Pradip Roy. “So if you stand beside them they can also rise back up like us, slowly.”\n\n— Esha Mitra in New Delhi and Ivana Kottasová in London contributed to this report.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05664-3', 'Headline': 'Impact of COVID-19 on food insecurity using multiple waves of high ...', 'Snippet': 'The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a systemic crisis across the globe.

In addition to the direct impact of the virus on people’s health, local lockdowns, recommendations to self-isolate, and disrupted travel and trade routes, have resulted in people losing their jobs, food shortages, and food prices increasing1,2. This perfect storm of reduced access to, and availability and affordability of, food has resulted in increased food insecurity (defined as existing when “all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”3, in both higher and lower-income countries4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nIn this paper, taking advantage of multiple waves of High Frequency Phone Surveys (HFPS) of households undertaken since the pandemic started, linked to ongoing panel micro studies, we undertake the first multi-country, multi-period analysis of the evolution of food insecurity in lower-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each of the governments of the 11 countries included in our analysis has implemented restrictions that include school closures, travel restrictions, and bans on public gatherings, to contain the spread of the virus10. While the stringency of the government responses were highest during March and April 2020 (in the early stages of the pandemic), some countries such as Djibouti and Mali started to relax their restrictions around July 2020. However, most of the sample countries continued to impose at least some restrictions until the end of 2020. With the rise of COVID-19 cases in the beginning of 2021 (Figure 1 in the Appendix), a number of countries re-imposed restrictions (Fig. 1). Countries have also implemented policies aimed at reducing the negative impacts of the pandemic and the restrictive policies, including emergency investments in healthcare facilities, and new forms of social welfare provision. We particularly focus on the policy interventions undertaken by governments to try to reduce the impact of the pandemic on food insecurity, including the use of food and cash safety nets.\n\nSocial safety nets have long been implemented by governments to protect poor and vulnerable people and improve socioeconomic conditions, and have been highlighted as being particularly important for vulnerable populations affected by negative shocks7,11,12. Government-funded safety nets are common across sub-Saharan Africa, indeed they can be found in every African country13. The explicit link between safety nets and food security, whether in higher or lower-income countries, is well documented in the literature14. Though there is a multitude of different safety nets, two common safety nets employed across many countries are cash transfer programmes and food-based programmes that can variously include providing food, food stamps, food vouchers, and food for work programmes13.\n\nA key debate in the literature, and among policy circles, is the extent to which cash or food assistance has most impact in reducing food insecurity15. Naturally, public nutrition programmes and food safety nets more broadly are designed to directly reduce food insecurity. Yet from a utility-maximising perspective, cash transfers tend to be considered to be more economically efficient because, at the margin, they do not distort consumption and production choices16,17,18. Further, cash transfers are often cheaper administratively18. There are also non-economic reasons for preferring cash to food transfers, such as that they are less “paternalistic”15,19.\n\nDespite theoretical and non-economic rationales for preferring cash to food transfers, there is a considerable body of empirical evidence that, in higher-income countries, in-kind transfers such as food stamps improve household food consumption more than cash transfers15. In lower-income countries, increasingly researchers are using randomised controlled trials, experiments, and regression analysis, to explore empirically whether cash or in-kind transfers are most effective at reducing food insecurity. As such, contextual evidence takes precedence over theoretical underpinnings.\n\nOur empirical findings suggest that safety nets in the form of cash assistance are more likely to reduce the chances of food insecurity among households over time. However, food assistance fails to significantly reduce the probability of food insecurity. Further, households with female and/or relatively less-educated heads, and those that are poorer or experiencing a pandemic-induced loss of income, have a higher chance of suffering food insecurity. We also show that households that were unable to rely on their savings and had to borrow to make ends meet were also more likely to suffer from food insecurity during the pandemic. As such, our paper shows the importance of understanding the socioeconomic underpinnings of COVID-19 impacts. Furthermore, heterogeneities in findings across countries reveal the need for evidence-based policies tailored to local contexts.\n\nData\n\nIn collaboration with international agencies including the European Commission, World Bank, and USAID, High Frequency Phone Surveys (HFPS) to investigate the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic have been conducted in a number of countries (https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/hfps). Many of these surveys are linked to ongoing household surveys and aim to collect information on loss of employment and income, health and wellbeing, impact on education of children, food (in)security, coping strategies adopted, and safety net disbursements. Summaries of these datasets, that we use in this study, are provided in Table 1.\n\nWe use these high-Frequency Phone Survey data on COVID-19 to track the impacts of the pandemic within and across countries. We present and analyse data from eleven countries. Specifically, we look at the following four indicators of household food insecurity from the survey questionnaire:\n\n1.\n\nHave you or any other adult in your household had to skip a meal in the last 30 days?\n\n2.\n\nDid the household go without eating for a whole day in the last 30 days?\n\n3.\n\nDid you or any other adult in your household run out of food in the last 30 days?\n\n4.\n\nWere you or any other member in your household hungry but did not eat in the last 30 days?\n\nAlthough there is considerable consistency across countries with respect to the indicators of food insecurity, coverage does vary from country to country. Whereas, for example, Malawi and Nigeria, at the time of writing, had each conducted seven waves, Armenia had only conducted one. Further, within these waves, some countries have consistently asked all four dimensions of food insecurity, whereas others have either only asked a subset, or have not asked the same questions consistently across waves.\n\nEstimation strategy\n\nWe use a fixed-effects linear probability model (Equation 1) to investigate the socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity during the pandemic for each country using household-level data over multiple waves for each of the food insecurity questions:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} y_{it} = \\delta X_{it} + \\phi Z_{it} + \\theta C_{it} + \\alpha _{i} + \\gamma _{t} + \\epsilon _{it} \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \\( y_{it}\\) is a binary outcome for household i in wave t in response to a specific food insecurity related question. \\(\\delta X_{it}\\) is a vector of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as education and gender, loss of household income compared to pre-pandemic levels/poverty status of households in the case of Chad, Djibouti, and Mali (income data are not available for these countries). In terms of safety nets, we control for whether a household has received cash or food benefits and, where this breakdown is unavailable, we control for whether a household has benefited from any safety net (\\(\\phi Z_{it}\\) is a vector of safety nets). To investigate whether the impact of safety nets on the probability of households suffering from food insecurity varies over time, interaction terms between the safety net variables and wave dummies are included. Because affordability of food is likely to be a strong determinant of food security, we include an additional dummy variable indicating whether the prices of major food items increased during the pandemic. We include two interaction terms; (1) increase in price and loss in income, and (2) increase in price and poverty status, to investigate whether increases in prices of major food items have a differential impact on food insecurity. \\(\\theta C_{it}\\) is a vector controlling for coping strategies that households have adopted during the pandemic: reliance on savings; and borrowing from friends, family, non-government organisations. Finally, we include sub-national and wave fixed-effects to control for unobserved heterogeneities (such as seasonality) across space and time. We use the sampling weights reported in the surveys.\n\nGovernment restrictions and consequent disruptions\n\nThe Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) reports stringency of governments’ policies and interventions to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Such measures might variously include school closures, travel restrictions, bans on public gatherings, emergency investments in healthcare facilities, new forms of social welfare provision, contact tracing and other interventions, and augmentation of health systems10. The index of stringency of these measures during the time period that the surveys in this paper were conducted is presented in Fig. 1. A clear pattern emerges. All 11 countries included in this paper rapidly transitioned from no restrictions at the start of 2020 to very high levels of restrictions by April 2020. Though stringency measures started to be relaxed from May 2020, most of the countries continued to impose considerable restrictions throughout the time period in consideration. Government stringency measures likely affected food security through a number of different channels, including loss of income where household members could not go to work20; and increasing food prices due to disruption of supply chains21, both of which we control for in our econometric analysis. The OxCGRT index is only available at the country-level, and not at the sub-national level. However, we control for sub-national heterogeneity in government restrictions by including regional fixed-effects and the changes in the stringency measures through the wave fixed-effects.\n\nFood insecurity and safety nets during the pandemic\n\nThe data from the multiple waves demonstrate how food insecurity has evolved during the pandemic. We present key descriptive statistics for each of the countries (Fig. 2). Some countries with multiple waves of data reveal clear trends across time. For example, in Nigeria and Uganda, across multiple dimensions, food security appears to be improving over time. In contrast, in Malawi, South Africa, and Chad, there is no clear pattern of improvement. These national level data hide sub-national trends, the richness of which are revealed in the country maps (Figures 3–10 in the Appendix).\n\nWhilst most countries report whether assistance is cash or food, two, Kenya and Armenia, only report government assistance in general terms, and some countries report three different categories of assistance. These discrepancies not withstanding, the data show that the extent and nature of the government safety nets varies considerably across countries (Fig. 3). Some countries, such as Ethiopia, have provided the majority of their population with either cash or food assistance. In other countries, such as Malawi, few households have received any type of government assistance. It should be noted that Chad and Mali have relatively low coverage of safety nets, this may be a government failure or it may be the case that coverage of safety nets is not being tracked. In the next section we undertake a series of econometric analyses to determine the extent to which these safety nets, in addition to other key variables, may have influenced how food insecurity has evolved during the pandemic.\n\nDeterminants of food insecurity\n\nThe econometric results are consistent across the four indicators of food insecurity (panels (a)–(d) in Fig. 4 and Tables 2, 3, 4, 5). Our results show that female-led households generally have a higher chance of food insecurity compared to male-led households. This effect is particularly pronounced in Malawi (for example, skipping a meal: 0.284, 95% CI 0.270, 0.299; going hungry: 0.541, 95% CI 0.516, 0.569). However, there are two exceptions: In Cambodia, having a female head reduces the probabilities of households going without eating for a whole day (panel (b); Fig. 4) and going hungry (panel (d); Fig. 4); and Chad, running out of food (panel (c); Fig. 4) and going hungry (panel (d); Fig. 4). The findings also suggest that households with relatively higher educated heads have a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity, suggesting that education continues to play an important role even during a pandemic. The influence of education varies considerably, with the highest benefits with respect to reducing the chances of being “hungry but did not eat” in Djibouti (− 0.232, 95% CI − 0.221, − 0.244), Ethiopia (− 0.156, 95% CI − 0.148, − 0.164), and Nigeria (− 0.156, 95% CI − 0.149, − 0.164); and the lowest in Malawi (− 0.006, 95% CI − 0.005, − 0.007).\n\nFood security is heavily influenced by a household’s ability to afford food. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the households experienced a loss in income, while prices of major food items have increased due to supply side constraints1,2. Our findings show that both these changes have increased households’ probability of suffering from food insecurity. The income effect is particularly strong in Cambodia (highest increase for the probability of “going without eating for a whole day”: 0.589, 95% CI 0.561, 0.619), Malawi (highest increase for the probability of “skipping a meal”: 0.274, 95% CI 0.260, 0.289), and Uganda (highest increase for the probability of “going without eating for a whole day”: 0.356, 95% CI 0.339, 0.374). For Chad, Djibouti, and Mali, we have poverty status of households rather than income information. For this group of countries, poverty status has the highest impact on the chances of being “hungry but did not eat” in Mali (0.382, 95% CI 0.364, 0.402), and the lowest in Malawi (0.135, 95% CI 0.129, 0.142). As would be expected, relatively poorer households have higher chances of suffering from food insecurity.\n\nAccording to our results, increases in prices of major food items have significantly affected food security among households across all 11 countries. Households in Ethiopia were particularly affected with respect to increased chance of “going hungry but did not eat” (0.327, 95% CI 0.311, 0.344); and those in Malawi with respect to increased chance of “running out food” (0.424, 95% CI 0.404, 0.444). Both interaction terms, loss of income and price increase dummy, and poverty status and price increase dummy, suggest that households who suffered income loss and relatively poorer households experienced relatively higher increases in the probability of food insecurity due to increases in prices of major food items (the highest effect is found in Mali in terms of increasing the chances of “going hungry but did not eat”: 0.447, 95% CI 0.426, 0.470). Though expected, these findings provide empirical evidence that increases in the prices of food items have a disproportionately higher impact on poorer households.\n\nIn terms of coping strategies, our findings show that households that were able to draw down on savings during the pandemic had a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity. Savings were more effective in reducing the probability of “skipping a meal” in Mali (− 0.327, 95% CI − 0.310, − 0.343), even controlling for poverty status of the households, than in other countries. In contrast, households that had to borrow (whether from friends or family or other sources) had a higher chance of experiencing food insecurity. These findings have implications for inequality and distributional impacts of the pandemic, as relatively higher income households are likely to have sufficient savings while poorer households are are likely have to borrow to make ends meet.\n\nDifferential impacts of safety nets\n\nOur findings indicate that cash transfers have been more effective than food transfers in reducing the probability of food insecurity during the pandemic (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8). The interaction terms between the safety net dummy variables and wave dummies further suggest that the efficacy of cash transfers improved during the pandemic. For households who received food as a safety net, however, though their probability of suffering from food insecurity also declined, across all countries with relevant data, it remained positive. For Kenya, where we do not have separate information on whether assistance is in the form of cash or food transfers, the results suggest that while safety nets were ineffective in the first wave, they did reduce the probability of food insecurity among household in the second and the third waves (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8 and Tables 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nThe lower-income countries addressed in this paper have been affected by, and responded to, the COVID-19 pandemic in different and varied ways. However, a number of common patterns emerge from the data that enable us to make several important contributions to the literature addressing food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and food insecurity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) more broadly. First, we have conducted the first multi-country, multi-time period analysis of the key factors influencing food insecurity during the pandemic. Across 11 countries and up to seven waves of data, we show how a combination of the direct health impacts of the pandemic and government responses restricting movement and trade have resulted in food insecurity that government safety nets have not fully mitigated. Our econometric analysis identifies key socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity during the pandemic. Importantly, we quantify these effects and demonstrate heterogeneity across countries and across food insecurity indicators, highlighting the importance of understanding local contexts. Specifically, households that are female-headed, less-educated, poor or experiencing a pandemic-induced loss of income, or without access to savings are more likely to suffer from food insecurity. These findings are consistent with much of the literature on the socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity22; and with23 who highlight key socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 related mortality. Because the educational background of parents influences their children’s educational, earnings, and wage outcomes24,25, our results further suggest that public investment and policies to improve education are likely to reduce inter-generational inequalities with respect food insecurity during any future crises, including possible future pandemics.\n\nSecond, we also show the differentiated impacts of household coping strategies—specifically savings versus borrowing. Our findings show that households that were able to rely on savings had a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity during the pandemic compared to the households that had to borrow, even controlling for poverty or loss of income. This finding is consistent with the literature that suggests that encouraging lower-income households to save will improve food security for the poor, not just in the context of the pandemic, and can build resilience to shocks and mitigate the more severe negative impacts of those shocks26,27,28. Third, our analysis confirms that the observed increases in the prices of major food items have increased the chances of food insecurity across countries, particularly for relatively poorer households and those that have suffered a loss in income.\n\nFinally, and importantly, our differentiated analysis of the efficacy of safety nets over time and across multiple countries demonstrates definitively that during this pandemic, cash assistance has reduced the chances of households suffering from food insecurity over time, whereas food assistance has failed to significantly reduce the probability of food insecurity during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, cash and food assistance have both been shown more broadly to improve food security across various dimensions. However, we recognise that there are other elements of food security, such as nutritional aspects and diet diversity, that we do not address, and that may not be influenced by cash transfers29. Many countries (such as Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, and South Africa) extended cash support using pre-pandemic information on vulnerability based on poverty status during the pandemic30. Our results support governments designing more targeted policies that take into account local contexts and location specific socioeconomic drivers of food insecurity; and targeting of particularly vulnerable groups including those who may be considered newly vulnerable due to shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, a number of countries have expanded cash transfers in a more targeted way, such as to the elderly (Cabo Verde, Mauritania), the disabled (Mauritania and Tunisia), and female-headed households (Mauritania). Further, countries including Madagascar and Sudan provided food assistance specifically to those who relied on daily earning who are particularly affected by government lockdown measures31. Combining these country specific targeted initiatives with our paper’s empirical findings offers guidance for governments as to how to ensure more effective food security outcomes from limited budgets.\n\nOur paper, one of the most comprehensive pieces of research to address food insecurity quantitatively across multiple countries and timescales, has revealed important empirical regularities of relevance to those responsible for improving food and nutrition status in households across lower-income countries. Our research supports the need for appropriately targeted safety nets, designed with an understanding of the specific country and household characteristics, and a broad understanding of food security that takes into account the importance of quality and nutritional content, in addition to quantity.\n\nWe recognise that though the data sets we use for our analysis are nationally representative, they are not directly comparable across countries and time, for example, in terms of the number of waves conducted, nor do they control for any potential seasonality effects. That said, we do control for the wave fixed-effects, and so do pick up seasonality aspects through the time fixed-effects. Furthermore, we do not run a pooled regression, instead the econometric analysis is conducted separately for each country, and therefore the risk of seasonality affecting our results is minimal.\n\nThese important debates over how to best reduce food insecurity tend to flare up during crises, such as pandemics, but are increasingly relevant more broadly given the persistence of food insecurity across LMICs and growing evidence that climate change is resulting in an increase in the number and proportion of under-nourished people across the globe32. As evidence increases that climate change is directly harming food security, government policies will be central to how countries adapt to the realities of climate change, particularly in terms of the likely increases in frequency and severity of shocks, on top of the slow-burn impact of increasing temperatures on crop yields.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-023-17104-6', 'Headline': 'A systematic review of the direct and indirect COVID-19’s impact on ...', 'Snippet': 'The summarised objective of all reviewed studies was to determine COVID-19’s burden on food security and associated dimension/s using the pre and post-COVID-19 food security analysis (Table 1).Four studies [25, 32,33,34] assessed the food security levels of households, three [16, 18, 36] identified the effect of the pandemic on the food security of individuals, while two studies [30, 31 ...', 'Full_text': 'Food security is defined as having healthy, nutritious, and physically and economically accessible food available to people in a defined geographic location and which satisfies the individuals’ dietary needs [1]. COVID-19, a communicable disease caused by the viral pathogen SARS-COV-2, continues to have multi-dimensional impacts all over the world [2,3,4]. Since its nominal emergence (31 December 2019), the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the food security of people across the world [5,6,7,8,9]. Specifically, the pandemic has impacting the food security of individuals and communities both directly and indirectly by overwhelming the agricultural productivity, exacerbating the energy poverty [10], and diminishing personal health and financial stability [11,12,13]. Prior to COVID-19, approximately 820 million individuals faced hunger each day globally, with over two billion individuals experiencing micronutrient deficiencies. These dietary issues in turn lead to increased risk of mortality and morbidities [14, 15]. COVID-19’s emergence resulted in disruptions to the production, processing, transporting, and marketing of food [15], which has caused flow-on impacts to food security. For example, fresh food products, including meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables, all recorded extensive price increases due to obstructions in transport channels [16]. A joint statement released in 2020 by the World Health Organization, (WHO) amongst others [14], reported that 3.3 billion global workers were identified as being at risk of losing their livelihood due to COVID-19. COVID-19 had exacerbated the already existing malnutrition in children. Further, 149 million children were estimated to have growth abnormalities, such as stunted (reduced in their growth performance), globally due to COVID-19 and other confounding factors, including natural disasters like drought, desert locust emergence, war and displacement [17]. The food security issues that arose due to COVID-19 were felt globally [18, 19], however, the level of crisis was more significant in lower-income countries [15] than in middle- and high-income countries.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) [1], there are four food security dimensions: availability; accessibility; usability; and sustainability/stability. Food availability is defined as the presence of adequate amount of food that satisfies the demand of the general population within a specified territory [20], while accessibility is the retrievability of food without excessive physical and/or economic barriers [21]. Usability of food refers to the nutritional quality of food and focuses on whether the accessible and available food is balanced, healthy, and nutritious [21]. This available and accessible food should then be able to satisfy the dietary and nutritional demands of the individual, households, community and/or the general population [20,21,22]. This food should be sustainable/stable by being available, accessible, and useful for a prolonged time [15, 20, 21]. All the four dimensions of food security are interdependent to each other and the effects of a certain factor that impacts one dimension can directly or indirectly overwhelm another [1]. As such, it is not appropriate to talk about food security using only one food security dimension. For instance, it is meaningless to discuss food accessibility, stability, and usability if food is not available and it is not rational to talk about food usability if food is not accessible.\n\nA recent article has identified the burden of COVID-19 pandemic on all the four dimensions [23], while another examined some of the food security dimensions [24]. Interestingly, findings from Iran showed that the emergence of COVID-19 had short term positive impact on food security of households and individuals [25]. Studies on the impact of COVID-19 were conducted in different geographic locations of the world, but the findings are currently inconsistent and sometimes contradictory. As a result, a compiled summary of all the available information, and which is informative for policy makers, food input suppliers, aid agencies and governmental and non-governmental bodies, is considered an appropriate research goal. In addition, identifying whether (and which) different food security dimensions have been impacted to greater or lesser extents during COVID-19 may assist local, regional and national government bodies in mitigating any emerging food insecurity issues.\n\nTo achieve these outcomes, a systematic review was conducted of all studies regarding COVID-19’s impact on food security. This paper examines the extent to which food security was directly and indirectly compromised by COVID-19, and how food security actors recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic induced food insecurity trauma. The application of findings of this systematic review are not necessarily restricted explicitly to COVID-19 as they may also have potential significance in early preparedness of the inevitable future pandemics. The purpose of this article was to summarise the food security impact of COVID-19 and pointing out the critically impacted dimension/s of food security. The specific questions that guided this systematic review were:\n\n1.\n\nHow much was food security directly and indirectly affected by COVID-19?\n\n2.\n\nWhich, if any, dimensions of food security were significantly compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nMethodology\n\nThis systematic review was undertaken in line with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines [26] and checklist [additional file 1]. In addition, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) systematic review checklist was used as a second point of reference to guide the process. Prior to the systematic review commencing, a protocol was prepared and registered in ROSPERO database with registration number CRD42022325475 and it was published online [27]. As indicated in the following sub-headings, each aspect of the PRISMA checklist was addressed sequentially.\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nPrimary research articles conducted on COVID-19’s impact on food security were the focus of the systematic review. However, so as to allow for comparative analysis of the burden of COVID-19, potential articles had to specifically focus on at least one of the four defined dimensions (food availability, accessibility, usability and stability) both prior to and/or following the emergence of COVID-19. No restrictions were placed on study design, with any qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method studies considered. Other types of literature (grey literature, review articles, protocols, reports, letters to editors and unpublished studies) were excluded from review. The reasons for excluding information sources other than primary research articles were to ensure the goal of identifying information from the primary source, and which were supported with data and followed expected research standards and procedures.\n\nIt is expected that primary research articles published in different languages on the topic of interest might be available in online information sources (databases), but only studies written in English were included. The timeframe for publication was from the approximate time of emergence of COVID-19 (31 December 2019) through to the end of this systematic review’s literature search (15 May 2022) were included.\n\nInformation sources, search strategy, and selection process\n\nFour databases (Web of Science; Scopus; PubMed; and Google Scholar) were used as the literature sources. The data from these four databases was identified from the nominal date for COVID-19 pandemic emergence (31/12/2019) through to 15/05/2022. All reference lists from the studies identified through the initial database searches were then explicitly assessed to avoid missing any relevant data source.\n\nA combination of search terms was used. The same terms were used for three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science), and search strings were applied according to the relevant database. As explained in the protocol [27], the search terms used for Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed were “Impact” OR “Effect” OR “Burden” AND “COVID 19”) OR “COVID-19 pandemic” OR “SARS COV 2” OR “Coronavirus disease 2019” OR “Coronavirus diseases 19” OR “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2”) AND “Food Security” OR “Food Insecurity” OR “Food Security dimension”. The publication date (31/12/2019—15/05/2022), the publication language (English), and the article type (primary research articles) were used as a filtering mechanism during the searching process. For identifying literature from Google Scholar, the short title of this systematic review (the COVID-19’s impact on food security, availability, accessibility, usability and stability) was used, and any potentially relevant articles that were not identified from other databases were included. Details of the search strategy for each database is described as follows.\n\nScopus: ( ALL ( impact) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( effect) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( burden) AND ALL ( covid 19) OR ALL ( covid-19 AND pandemic) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( sars AND cov 2) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( coronavirus AND disease 2019) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( coronavirus AND diseases 19) OR ABS ( severe AND acute AND respiratory AND syndrome AND coronavirus-2) AND ALL ( food AND security) OR ALL ( food AND insecurity) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( food AND security AND dimension)) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE, ""ar"")) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( PUBSTAGE, ""final"")) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( LANGUAGE, ""English"")).\n\nPubMed: (((((((((((Impact[Title/Abstract]) OR (Effect[Title])) OR (Burden[Title])) AND (COVID 19[Title/Abstract])) OR (COVID-19 Pandemic[Title/Abstract])) OR (SARS COV 2[Title/Abstract])) OR (Coronavirus disease 2019[Title/Abstract])) OR (Coronavirus diseases 19[Title/Abstract])) OR (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2[Title/Abstract])) AND (Food Security[Title/Abstract])) OR (Food Insecurity[Title/Abstract])) OR (Food Security dimension[Title/Abstract]).\n\nWeb of Science: Impact (All Fields) OR Effect (Abstract) OR Burden (Abstract) AND COVID 19 (All Fields) OR COVID-19 pandemic (All Fields) OR SARS COV 2 (Title) OR Coronavirus disease 2019 (All Fields) OR Coronavirus disease 19 (All Fields) OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (Abstract) AND Food Security (All Fields) OR Food Insecurity (All Fields) OR Food Security dimension (Abstract) and 2020 or 2021 or 2022 (Publication Years) and Article (Document Types) and English (Languages).\n\nGoogle scholar: COVID-19, Food Security, Impact, OR COVID-19, OR Pandemic, OR Food OR security, OR availability, OR accessibility, OR usability, OR stability.\n\nThe first author conducted the primary screening, and the same process was repeated by the other team members to ensure the validity and reliability of selection processes. Identification of potentially eligible studies was conducted initially through title and abstract screening, prior to a full text review occurring. A pre-determined process for resolving any disagreements was established, however ultimately there were no disagreements in the selection process among the review authors.\n\nData items and collection process\n\nStudies selected from the four databases were imported to EndNote X9. Literature searches were undertaken on 01 May 2022 for the first time and repeated 2 weeks later for the second time. The identified articles were de-duplicated using EndNote X9’s unique identifier function. Any redundant studies missed by the EndNote unique identifier were manually de-duplicated. The studies were considered regardless of the studies’ statistical analysis, geographic coverage, and study participants (individual, household, community or country). All COVID-19 related factors that exacerbated the food insecurity of individuals/households, such as COVID-19 prevention restrictions, agricultural production interruptions, job losses, import–export bans, and mortality of productive workforces, were synthesised into the final results.\n\nStudy risk of bias assessment\n\nThe Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used for assessing the risk of biases. The eight items of the JBI checklist are designed for assessing the risk of biases in reviewing primary studies with Yes, No, Unclear or Not Applicable answers. The items of the checklist are: 1) the inclusion and exclusion criteria of samples; 2) study subjects and settings; 3) exposure measurement validity and reliability; 4) objective and standard criteria of condition measurement; 5) identification of confounding factors; 6) strategies to deal with confounding factors; 7) validity and reliability of outcome measures; and 8) the use of appropriate statistical analysis in included studies.\n\nBased on the JBI critical appraisal checklist, each included study was independently appraised by a second author and no disagreement were raised among team members.\n\nEffect measures and synthesis methods\n\nCOVID-19-related food production or supply chain restrictions was considered as impacts on food availability. Food security reductions due to physical or economic constraints during COVID-19 were classified as food inaccessibility. The food quality and diversity reduction during the pandemic was interpreted as the impact of COVID-19 on food usability. Short-term food items availability that cannot be sustained due to the direct (effect on the food supply chain) and indirect (health and economic burdens) impacts were deemed to be food stability issues. Food insecurity increases during COVID-19 as compared with pre-pandemic food insecurity were expressed in the form of percentages. Overall, one or more food security dimension/s that was/were repeatedly reported by the majority of the included studies was identified as significantly altered dimension by COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSynthesis of this systematic review was focused on investigating COVID-19’s impact on food security and/or its four dimensions (availability, accessibility, usability and stability). Any included studies that failed to consider relevant confounding food insecurity drivers were critically appraised in the discussion and risk of bias assessment sections of this systematic review.\n\nReporting bias and certainty assessments\n\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) tool was used for assessing reporting biases in the studies. As recommended by Berkman et al. [28], the authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the papers using the AHRQ checklists. Based on the checklists, the studies with a high probability of reporting bias were categorised as “suspected” and the studies with a low probability of bias were noted as “undetected.” The certainties of evidence were assessed using the GRADE tool. The alignment of findings, the consistency of evidence, the level of suspected publication biases, the limitations of reviewed studies, and the availability of target outcomes in the reviewed studies were considered as factors for certainty.\n\nStudy selection\n\nOf the initial sample of 2,057 studies identified through the first search, 1,220 were found through database searching and the remaining 837 were from other sources, such as the aforementioned review of reference lists (Fig. 1). Of the 1220 papers found through database searches, 27 were identified as eligible for review, but 20 were removed due to the lack of pre-COVID-19 food security information. Fourteen potentially eligible studies were identified from other sources; 11 of these were removed because they were duplicates of studies already identified. Overall, this resulted in seven studies from the database search and three studies from other sources being included in the final sample of ten papers (Fig. 1). The study by Pradeilles et al. [29] in Peru was initially considered eligible to be included for review, but was removed due to a lack of pre-COVID-19 data for the food insecurity experience scale (FIES) indicator.\n\nCharacteristics of the reviewed studies\n\nTwo papers were published in 2020, seven in 2021, and one in 2022 (Table 1). Three studies [18, 30, 31] were conducted in the United States of America and the remaining studies included countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, Uganda, Kenya, Chile, Mexico, Lebanon, and Iran (Table 1). Only one study [16] covered the food insecurity prevalence of two countries (Kenya & Uganda), with the others covering either a single county or a province [25, 32] in a single country, or populations [30, 31] in the same country.\n\nThe summarised objective of all reviewed studies was to determine COVID-19’s burden on food security and associated dimension/s using the pre and post-COVID-19 food security analysis (Table 1). Four studies [25, 32,33,34] assessed the food security levels of households, three [16, 18, 36] identified the effect of the pandemic on the food security of individuals, while two studies [30, 31] investigated food insecurity levels in college students before and at the time of the pandemic in the United States of America. The remaining study [35] assessed food security of mothers before and after the pandemic in Bangladesh. The majority (8 out of 10) of the studies used a cross-sectional study design (Table 1) and the remaining studies used interrupted time series [35], and predictive model [36] designs. As indicated by Gaitán-Rossi et al. [33], food security of households with children was reduced. Contrary to the majority (9 out of 10) of the studies, the research conducted in Iran’s Tehran province [25] reported that the emergence of COVID-19 resulted in improved food security among households.\n\nRisk of bias in studies\n\nBased on the JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies, six studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias in all 8 items of the checklist while 4 studies [25, 32, 35, 36] were found to have unclear risk of bias in four items (Q1, Q3, Q4, and Q6) of the checklist (Table 2). Eight of the included studies used cross-sectional study design and the remaining two studies [35 and 36] had used predictive model and interrupted time series study designs. The JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies was designed for analytical cross-sectional studies and it was challenging to find a specific and appropriate risk of bias assessment tool for the two studies that used a predictive model [36] and interrupted time series [35]. Since the main difference of these study designs from cross-sectional methodologies is time-frame and ways of measurement, the JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies was considered still potentially suitable for predictive model and interrupted time series designs, and was therefore used.\n\nThe compromised food security dimension and its associated factors\n\nA majority (9 out of 10) of the studies used validated food security indicators, while one [36] of the studies estimated the food insecurity prevalence using a predictive model from previous food insecurity trends. The most compromised food security dimension identified across nine studies was the accessibility of food, with all the studies reporting that economic crisis due to COVID-19 was the main cause of food inaccessibility (Table 3). Two studies [16, 32] confirmed that the usability (quality) of food was reduced during COVID-19 and that food diversity during COVID-19 was less than the food diversity before the emergence of the pandemic. The study from Iran [25] reported that the food diversity (usability/quality) of households had actually increased following COVID-19 and the food security was improved. This was in contrast to the study conducted in Indonesia [32] which indicated that food access, availability, and usability were all compromised by COVID-19.\n\nTwo studies [30, 31] examined food security using prior and following the pandemic emergence food security levels of individuals. Both papers identified the negative impact of COVID-19 on food security, with food security status reduced during the pandemic as compared with the pre-pandemic food security status (Table 4). The remaining eight studies explored COVID-19 related food security using pre- and post-COVID-19 emergence food insecurity prevalence.\n\nRisk of reporting bias in reviewed studies\n\nEach reviewed study was assessed using the AHRQ bias assessment criteria. Berkman et al. [28] noted that the reporting of bias assessment outcomes using this tool shall be either “suspected” or “undetected”. If the reviewer cannot identify any reporting bias from studies, it is recommended to say ‘undetected’ than to say ‘free from reporting biases’. Based on this tool (AHRQ), the reporting biases of the majority (9 out of 10) of the reviewed studies were assessed as “undetected” as indicated by the tick “√” symbol in Table 5. The study [36] that used a predictive model for estimating food insecurity was assessed as being “suspected” of bias, as the study was based on the food insecurity data 2–4 years before the occurrence of the pandemic and did not necessarily report on data indicative of the current situation immediately prior to and during the pandemic. Since there might be unidentified food insecurity variation during that longer time period, it was considered potentially problematic to compare the food insecurity during COVID-19 with the situation greater than 2 years prior to the pandemic’s emergence. As a result, the food insecurity report by Kharroubi et al. [36] was suspected of potential bias.\n\nCertainty of evidence\n\nBased on the GRADE Pro handbook the certainty of results was assessed in three modalities (low, very low, moderate, and high). Each study was judged based on the pre-set criteria (Table 6). The study that included pre and post-COVID-19 emergence food security data, identified impacted food security dimension/s, and used collected data instead of estimations was categorised as having a ‘high’ certainty of evidence. The evidence from the majority (9 out of 10) of the studies had high certainty of evidence. The remaining paper [36], which used retrospective data collected 2–4 years before the emergence of COVID-19, was categorised as having low certainty of evidence, particularly considering the influences and multifactored nature of food insecurity.\n\nConceptually, food security is a complex and multifaceted issue [37], with four separate dimensions (food access, availability, usability, and stability) and is influenced by biological, social, and economic factors. As a result of its complexity, it is difficult for all dimensions of food security to be covered with any single food security indicator and a combination of tools should be used to examine the impact of COVID-19’s on food security [37, 38]. The current systematic review was designed to assess the COVID-19 related crisis on food security and associated food dimensions. This was undertaken using a pre-and post-comparative analysis by considering the date of COVID-19 emergence as the reference point. The main findings from this systematic review are presented below.\n\nFood insecurity due to COVID-19\n\nNine of the included studies reported that COVID-19 negatively affected food security and reported reduced food security status [30, 31] or increased food insecurity prevalence [16, 18, 32,33,34,35,36]. These articles noted that food security reduction in the form of four food security modalities (high food security, marginal food security, low food security, or very low food security) [9, 16, 35, 39]. In contrast to the other papers, the study conducted in Iran [25] reported that COVID-19 had a positive impact by increasing the food security and dietary diversity of households. The authors of this study [25] justified that the food security and dietary diversity improvement during COVID-19 was due to free food supplements to vulnerable groups, extending e-marketing, delivering nutrition advice, and governmental and non-governmental donations to the people, during the pandemic.\n\nThe largest food insecurity increase (44%) due to COVID-19 was observed in Uganda followed by Kenya [16] with a 38% food insecurity prevalence difference pre-and post-pandemic. This food insecurity prevalence was considered to be largely due to the rural–urban marketing channel disturbance of fresh food products like fish, meat, and vegetables [16]. Except the study conducted in Iran [25], other studies indicated that food security was reduced during COVID-19, with reported figures of 17% in Indonesia [32], 11% in Mexico [33], 19% in Chile [34], 31% in Bangladesh [35], 12% in Lebanon [36], and 8.4% in the USA [18]. In two studies, food security was reduced by 15.7% [34] and 3.34% [30] due to COVID-19 in the United States of America. The economic crisis due to COVID-19, increased unemployment [39], food value chain disturbances [40, 41], marketing channel interruptions [42, 43], and food service provider (hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, and retailers) closures [44] were mentioned as the main constraints of food security during COVID-19. These findings would indicate that proactive planning to facilitate more immediate intervention measures by governmental and non-governmental organizations toward food security resilience are needed for future pandemics [25].\n\nThe compromised food security dimension\n\nThe majority (9 out of 10) of the included studies confirmed that the most affected food security dimension was food access, which is consistent with other research [9, 45] that identified food access as being substantially impacted. It is acknowledged that the included studies didn’t use equivalent methods that equally measure all four of the food security dimensions, and this may have led to some diversity in data. Nonetheless, there was a consistent theme across the majority of papers. It was argued that food inaccessibility was primarily due to the poor economic capacity of consumers. This is not surprising; however, it is worth highlighting that physical food inaccessibility was also considered a result of lockdowns which led to a reduction in food access [30,31,32,33].\n\nIn addition to food accessibility, the availability of food [32, 33], and usability/quality of food [16, 32] were reported as being compromised due to COVID-19. The effect of COVID-19 on food usability was considered to be compromised due to a reduction in food diversity. Specifically, one paper [32] identified that three food security dimensions (accessibility, availability, and usability) were affected due to the restrictions and measures applied for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Once food accessibility or availability is compromised, food stability/sustainability is impacted by default [24, 46]. Lockdown measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 were identified as the main factor for this reduction in food security [47], and this one aspect of food security impacted the entire food system chain [23].\n\nLimitation of the reviewed studies and the review process\n\nThe studies did not necessarily take into account any potential confounding factors, such as illnesses other than COVID-19 [48], natural disasters during COVID-19 (desert locusts in Kenya, Uganda, and Lebanon, and floods in Bangladesh) [49], and climate change at the time of the pandemic [50]. Such factors will also have contributed to the reduction of food security and can therefore obscure the real effect of COVID-19. It is also worth recognising that experience-based food security measures are usually subject to recall biases [51]. Since the included studies used cross-sectional study designs, it is not possible to establish trends of food insecurity developments and to prioritise potential interventions.\n\nDue to time constraints, only primary research articles were included, with brief reports, unpublished studies, reviews, and studies published in languages other than English excluded. This approach to study selection might have excluded relevant literature. This is important as the time delay from doing a study until results are presented in a journal may have meant that potentially relevant papers relating to a recent issue, such as COVID-19, had not yet had sufficient time to be published. Moreover, it is acknowledged that the initial selection system using title and abstract can also be prone to potentially missing relevant studies [52].\n\nThe food security of households and individuals was severely compromised due to COVID-19 emergence. The health, agriculture and socio-economic crises following the COVID-19 pandemic indirectly impacted food security as compared with the pre-pandemic situations. The food accessibility dimension of food security was mainly impacted due to the pandemic. Contrary to the pandemic’s negative impact, integrated food aid interventions by private sectors, and governmental and non-governmental organizations improved food security during COVID-19. Based on this conclusion, the following recommendations were forwarded.\n\nBalancing COVID-19 prevention and food security crises\n\nTo implement either localised or widespread COVID-19 restrictions, such as transport bans, lockdowns, food market chain restrictions, and quarantine, the benefits should outweigh any problems that arise. This is particularly relevant for disadvantaged groups, particularly in low-income countries, where circumstances characterised by ‘hand to mouth’ meant entire communities cannot easily cope with any new food security crises, such as those arising due to COVID-19 prevention measures [53]. Therefore, any COVID-19 prevention restrictions should consider these social groups and balance the positives of reduced COVID-19 transmission arising from such restrictions, against the detrimental impact associated with food security [54].\n\nDecisions that are unidirectionally focused (i.e. focusing on health crisis only) and implemented hastily without due consideration to all possibly factors, may have a catastrophic impact on food security. Unless these decisions are made in integrated manner (for instance in a ‘one health’ approach), emerging crises due to food insecurity might be as devasting as the personal health impact directly from COVID-19. Participating multi-disciplinary professionals, facilitating emergency food aid and SafetyNet programs, and prioritizing the pros and cons of COVID-19 prevention measures before implementation, should all be considered as potential strategies for balancing COVID-19’s prevention measures and arising food security crises.\n\nIntegrated food security interventions\n\nFood insecurity, arising either directly from the pandemic or indirectly due to restrictions applied for its prevention and control, should be mitigated by integrated interventions that are coordinated by governmental and non-governmental organisations, individuals, and institutions. Food security interventions can reduce mortality associated with food insecurity while balancing the need for COVID-19 prevention restrictions [55]. Although the data is limited, the food security crises during COVID-19 appear to be higher in low- and middle-income countries when compared to high-income countries. Therefore, along with the integrated COVID-19 prevention, collaborative food security intervention between countries is recommended as a proactive strategy to alleviate future problems associated with pandemics [56]. There was stepwise food insecurity increments in households with children [33]. Based on this food insecurity trend, it is recommended that food security actors (like food suppliers, aid and agricultural organizations) prioritise households with children. Households and individuals who were vulnerable for food security crises, including those with lower income, unemployed household member, female-leaded household, households with more children, and household members with lower educational level, are particularly highlighted for urgent intervention areas [34].\n\nSupporting food security resilience\n\nThis systematic review found that food security was severely affected by COVID-19. This compromised food security needs to be supported to recover, and communities that experience food insecurity should be proactively assisted to overcome both immediate and emerging crises. To achieve food security resilience, communities needed to be provided with the tools and resources to be more independent. Unless cooperative food insecurity resilience is applied, the vulnerable groups\' morbidity and mortality due to food insecurity will be exacerbated [57].\n\nFuture implications\n\nThere is currently a lack of comparative data examining food security pre and post-COVID-19 emergence, and a more nuanced understanding of these complex issues can only be achieved with a greater focus on these areas. Studies regarding the effect of post-pandemic restrictions on food security, determining the vulnerable groups for food insecurity, identifying the food security resilience methods during and after COVID-19, and investigating the merits and emerging problems arising from COVID-19 prevention measures are all recommended topics for consideration in prospective studies. Considering the limitations of included studies, it is also suggested that future research should consider and evaluate the multiple food security driving factors external to COVID-19 that might increase the food security crisis.\n\nRegistration and protocol\n\nThis systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the registrations number: CRD42022325475. Protocol for the review process was prepared and the review was conducted as per the pre-planned protocol. The protocol is published at PLOS ONE [27] and can be accessed online (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9362949/).\n\nAmendments of published protocol\n\nThe protocol of this systematic review [27] was published before the end of this article. In the protocol, the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool was proposed to be used as a risk of bias assessment tool. Since this tool is more appropriate for systematic reviews than primary studies, the risk of bias of this systematic review was assessed using JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.phi.org/thought-leadership/the-news-about-hunger-revealed-increased-support-for-government-assistance-during-covid-will-it-stay-that-way/', 'Headline': 'The News About Hunger Revealed Increased Support for Government ...', 'Snippet': 'And in the real world, we saw the impact of government action: hunger was poised to soar early in the COVID-19 pandemic, but Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) structure and policy changes made it easier for families to access SNAP during this period, and hunger stayed level in 2020.', 'Full_text': 'Heather Gelhert with PHI’s Berkeley Studies Media Group provides an analysis of how media coverage of food insecurity changed during the COVID pandemic and offers lessons learned on how the conversation around hunger can continue through an equity lens.\n\nI grew up in the rural Midwest well below the federal poverty line. Although we lived in a farming community, my parents had to get creative to make sure we always had a meal on the table. Still, they never sought food assistance or signed me up for free school lunches because they worried the stigma would lead to bullying. My parents weren’t wrong to be concerned: Degrading stereotypes about people on welfare were a fixture of dominant U.S. culture during my childhood in the 80s — and once you’ve heard them enough, you start to believe them. So, my mom and dad, like many families facing similar circumstances, tried to create distance between ourselves and “other” poor people. We never talked openly about the “us-versus-them” narrative, but we feared it. Internalized it. Felt its shame.\n\nIn 2020, widespread changes wrought by the pandemic began to chip away at that shame-filled narrative. As our country’s botched response to the virus threw millions of households into financial hardship, leaving people unable to afford basic necessities like food and rent, the longstanding “us-versus-them” mentality lost a lot of its power. Conversations across social media started to reflect this with popular memes like “We are in this together” and “We are not all in the same boat, but we are in the same storm.” We saw this shift mirrored in traditional news coverage: BMSG’s research on news from the first year of the pandemic showed that many stories evoked empathy for food assistance recipients, and framed them as “people like us.” We also found that there were no articles about food stamp fraud and abuse, topics that were prevalent before the pandemic.\n\nMore recent research shows that this change in news coverage continued in the second year of the pandemic. To learn more about the changes unfolding, BMSG and our partners at the Collaborative on Media and Messaging for Health and Social Policy (COMM) analyzed broadcasts and stories about hunger that aired or were published between Jan. 1, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2021. The results confirmed our hunch: Stories about food stamp fraud were still rare, with references to such allegations appearing in only 6% of print articles and 3% of TV stories.\n\nInstead, our team found overwhelmingly positive portrayals of government, increased calls for a robust government role in alleviating hunger, and strong appeals to empathy. Families, in particular, were framed as needing food assistance and were mentioned in over 80% of print articles and almost half of TV clips in the context of emergency electronic benefit transfer (EBT) or providing school lunches during the pandemic. Media outlets continued to center government action in their stories, highlighting President Biden’s executive orders that expanded food assistance and increased the amount of benefits that people were eligible for.\n\nThe narrative change was significant, giving advocates hope for a stronger social safety net over the long term. Finally, the public conversation around food assistance had less stigma. It seemed clearer that there is no them — it was always just us. But, as the COVID emergency ends and hunger-related benefits expire under the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service, will shame and stigma return to the conversation?\n\nOn one hand, headlines tell us that the hunger crisis continues (with 32 million people already receiving less food assistance), that older Americans are especially vulnerable, and that food benefit reductions are putting extra pressure on local food banks. On the other hand, we are already seeing conservative policy proposals to retract recent program expansions making the news, with headlines like:\n\n1 in 4 could lose food stamps under a GOP bill. These states would be hit hardest;\n\nGOP eyes new work requirements for millions on Medicaid, food stamps; and\n\nCuts to SNAP benefits will push millions over the hunger cliff.\n\nWithout actively steering the narrative, these conservative proposals could shift news coverage about food assistance back toward a more stigmatized and less government-focused conversation about the programs — one that demonizes poor people and people of color. Fortunately, there are several steps advocates can take to advance their policy goals by communicating strategically through effective message development and delivery:\n\nLead with values.\n\nIf we want news outlets to maintain a broad frame that includes government accountability in stories about food assistance, we must start with a point of agreement: our values. As President Biden said in a TV clip that BMSG and COMM researchers analyzed, “These are not the values of our nation. We cannot and will not let people go hungry.” Values create space to approach the issue from a place of strength and optimism, rather than weakness or cynicism. In a time of great political division, many people are eager for messages that elevate interconnection and solidarity.\n\nUse an equity lens.\n\nAn inclusive narrative about food assistance benefits everyone, and this is especially true for low-income people and communities of color. However, our study found that racial equity was mostly absent from coverage. Just as frontline and essential workers — who are disproportionately people of color — were critical to our country’s ability to weather the pandemic, they are also critical to our ongoing recovery. The people who grow our food and keep our grocery stores stocked ought to be able to access food themselves. Messages about hunger should make clear who would be disproportionately harmed by cuts to our social safety net: low-income families, people of color, and seniors.\n\nPitch opinion pieces.\n\nAlthough researchers found that the overall narrative about food assistance was positive toward recipients during the start of the pandemic, opinion coverage was relatively rare overall. Advocates have an opportunity to write and pitch more guest commentaries, letters to the editor, or even “owned media” like blogs. Opinion pieces remain a strong way to reach policymakers — an important target audience in conversations surrounding hunger.\n\nCenter the role of government.\n\nWhen government is mentioned in news about public health issues, it is sometimes framed as an inept, bumbling bureaucracy, which may make it harder for audiences to believe that it can also be part of the solution. However, media coverage around food assistance during the pandemic instead centered the government as taking action to solve widespread food insecurity. And in the real world, we saw the impact of government action: hunger was poised to soar early in the COVID-19 pandemic, but Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) structure and policy changes made it easier for families to access SNAP during this period, and hunger stayed level in 2020.\n\nAs the pandemic fades into the background, it is more important than ever to highlight stories where government actions have been successful in helping people who receive food assistance. Advocates can continue to frame government actors and agencies as a necessary part of the solution — and be specific about who should act and what they should do. If advocates keep the onus for addressing hunger on the government, we hope that accountability and systemic solutions will continue to be part of the narrative, challenging the traditional news stories that evoked individual responsibility and “bootstrapping” and an emphasis on individualized causes and solutions that we often saw in news before the pandemic.\n\nOur country is stronger when everyone is able to feed themselves and their families. Narratives about hunger during the pandemic elevated this truth, but without action, we risk reverting back to us-versus-them rhetoric and food assistance policies based on a scarcity mindset and shame. Advocates can use strategic communication and opinion space to show how current proposals that would increase hunger are out of touch with our values. Although Biden has declared the COVID emergency over, conversations about fair, equitable ways for the government to address food insecurity shouldn’t be.

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-did-it-robby-mook-michael-sussmann-donald-trump-russia-collusion-alfa-bank-11653084709', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton Did It - WSJ - The Wall Street Journal', 'Snippet': 'The Russia-Trump collusion narrative of 2016 and beyond was a dirty trick for the ages, and now we know it came from the top—candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.

During the Trump administration, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe released some of Brennan’s notes about the intelligence used in his briefing of former President Barack Obama.\n\nRatcliffe publicly said that the intelligence community never corroborated the Russian claims of a “Clinton Plan” to frame Trump, and didn’t know whether it was fabricated.\n\nIn her interview with Durham’s investigators, Clinton expressed sympathy for Durham’s hunt. She calls it, “really sad,” adding, “I get it, you have to go down every rabbit hole.”\n\nBut Durham believes the uncorroborated intelligence should have at least made the FBI question whether it was being used by a political opponent to pursue allegations against the Trump campaign, the report shows.\n\nClinton called the intelligence that was consuming Durham’s time bogus, saying it “looked like Russian disinformation to me.”\n\nA spokesman for Clinton didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday.\n\nDurham concludes that it would be impossible to prosecute anyone for their handling of the intelligence.

Moscow denies any involvement.\n\nThe report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out instances where the president possibly obstructed justice.\n\nA decided longshot\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly claimed there was a Democratic conspiracy to undermine his presidency by suggesting his campaign had nefarious ties to Russia. Now he\'s putting his lawyers where his mouth is.\n\nThe lawsuit - against members of the Clinton campaign and senior FBI officials - is a decided longshot, in part because there is ample evidence of connections between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives as documented by Robert Mueller\'s special counsel investigation and a report by the bipartisan Senate intelligence committee.\n\nThe evidence includes the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior campaign staff and Russian nationals and contacts Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had with a suspected Russian intelligence operative. While that did not lead to charges of criminal collaboration between Mr Trump\'s team and Russia, it could undermine Mr Trump\'s allegations that the Clinton team invented the Trump campaign\'s Russia connections out of whole cloth.\n\nA court victory may be unlikely, but Mr Trump can tout the lawsuit itself to his supporters as evidence that he is fighting back against his accusers. And if the case is eventually dismissed, it will be cited as a sign the establishment is still out to get him.\n\nMr Trump\'s legal complaint alleges that ""in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Mrs Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot - one that shocks the conscience and is an affront to this nation\'s democracy.\n\n""Acting in concert, the Defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent, Donald J Trump, was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty.""\n\nThe complaint cites court filings made by special counsel John Durham, a US government attorney appointed by then-President Donald Trump\'s justice department in 2019 to investigate whether the government acted lawfully and appropriately when collecting intelligence ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

Durham alleges Sussmann lied to the FBI about who his client was during a meeting where Sussmann shared information about possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nBut in a few extra sentences, Durham\'s filing mentions a second instance where Sussmann tried to raise concerns of a Trump-Russia connection, this time apparently to the CIA. That information came from one of Sussmann\'s clients, technology executive Rodney Joffe.\n\nDurham\'s filing noted that Joffe\'s company, Neustar, had an arrangement to provide security-related work on computer servers, including the White House\'s. But, according to the filing, Joffe used that access to mine Internet data to establish an inference and narrative tying then-candidate Trump to Russia.\n\nJoffe has not been charged with any crime.\n\nAll of this has now been spun by conservative media and former President Trump himself to say Sussmann and Joffe were Clinton operatives who were paid to illegally hack into and spy on the Trump campaign and Trump White House.\n\nFormer President Trump wrote: ""In a stronger period of time in our country, this crime would have been punishable by death.""\n\nIn a column this week, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charlie Savage of The New York Times wrote that the entire narrative appeared to be mostly wrong or old news, and its conclusions ""based on a misleading presentation of the facts or outright misinformation.""\n\nCharlie Savage joins me now.\n\nI wonder if you could help us understand just initially how we got to this point, how Durham\'s investigation has morphed into this sort of explosive story in conservative media.\n\nCharlie Savage, The New York Times:\n\nSo, back in the Trump administration, right after Robert Mueller, the Russian special counsel, finished his report, Donald Trump shifted — tried to shift the narrative to or escalated his attempt to shift the narrative to the idea that he was actually a victim of a deep state conspiracy.\n\nAnd his attorney general, Bill Barr, as you mentioned, appointed John Durham, then a U.S. attorney, to be what became another special counsel, a special counsel to investigate the investigation.\n\nAnd the whole idea and expectation then was he was going to prove Trump\'s narrative that there were high-level officials who — in the FBI and the CIA who had essentially framed him for collusion.\n\nBut we\'re almost three years in now, and he has yet to bring any charges against the high-level officials. He has developed two cases against outsiders, and one of them is this Sussmann case. Both of these are merely false statement cases. They\'re not charging a conspiracy.\n\nBut Mr. Durham has used court filings and indictments and so forth, related to these cases to put out large amounts of information that are not directly related to the charges. And this information is imbued with insinuations that there is some kind of vast anti-Trump conspiracy.\n\nHe just hasn\'t been able to prove it yet or charge it. It all goes back to Hillary Clinton, is the implication.\n\nCharlie Savage:\n\nThere\'s been this repeated cycle of huge alarmism stoked within right-wing pro-Trump outlets that I don\'t really consider doing the same kind of journalism that I\'m doing sending out the message with the blaring outrage, grievance-stroking headlines that now it\'s been proven they were spying on President Trump.\n\nAnd every time you look at it, it — there\'s less there than meets the eye. But if you don\'t cover it, then that allows the sort of Trump world and his allies to say, aha, you know, the media, they\'re in on it. They\'re covering it up. It\'s a conspiracy.

by Mr Trump\'s political opponents to fuel the probe, US Special Counsel John Durham concluded in a report released on Monday.\n\nThe report marks the end of a four-year investigation launched in May 2019 when then-Attorney-General William Barr appointed Mr Durham, a veteran prosecutor, to probe potential missteps by the FBI when it launched its early stage Crossfire Hurricane inquiry into potential contacts between Mr Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nMr Durham said there were a series of missteps by the FBI and Justice Department as investigators undertook a politically explosive probe in the heat of the 2016 election into whether the Trump campaign was colluding with Russia to tip the outcome.\n\nBut the report fell far short of the former president\'s prediction he would uncover the ""crime of the century"".\n\nThat Crossfire Hurricane investigation would later be handed over to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who in March 2019 concluded there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump\'s 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nIn his new 306-page report, Mr Durham concluded that US intelligence and law enforcement did not possess any ""actual evidence"" of collusion between Mr Trump\'s campaign and Russia prior to launching Crossfire Hurricane.\n\nHe also accused the bureau of treating the 2016 Trump probe differently from other politically sensitive investigations, including several involving Mr Trump\'s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nFor instance, he said Ms Clinton and other officials received defensive briefings about being the possible targets of foreign interference, whereas Mr Trump received no such briefing before the FBI opened probes into four members of his campaign.\n\n""Senior FBI personnel displayed a serious lack of analytical rigour towards the information that they received, especially information from politically affiliated persons and entities.""\n\nIn response to the report, the FBI said it has already implemented dozens of corrective actions that have been in place for some time.\n\nThe report criticised the FBI for opening a full-fledged investigation based on ""raw, unanalysed and uncorroborated intelligence,"" saying the speed at which it did so was a departure from the norm.\n\nIt said investigators repeatedly relied on ""confirmation bias"", ignoring or rationalising away evidence that undercut their premise of a Trump-Russia conspiracy as they pushed the probe forward.\n\nPolitical implications of report\n\nMr Durham\'s report was released to Congress on Monday without redactions, after it was delivered to Attorney-General Merrick Garland on Friday.\n\nMr Durham and his team cast a broad net, interviewing top officials at the FBI, Justice Department and CIA.\n\nIn his first year on the job, he travelled with Mr Barr to Italy to meet with government officials as Mr Trump himself asked then-Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and other leaders to help with the probe.\n\nHis findings are likely to become political fodder for Mr Trump, who is planning to run for re-election in 2024 despite facing criminal charges in New York and two federal investigations by Special Counsel Jack Smith that are looking both at Mr Trump\'s retention of classified records and his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMr Trump had hoped Mr Durham would release his report ahead of the 2020 election, in what he thought would be a blow to President Joe Biden\'s campaign.\n\nBut Mr Durham\'s investigation has largely failed to produce a meaningful impact, after two separate juries acquitted both defendants he tried to prosecute in 2022.\n\nIn one case Mr Durham brought, a Washington DC jury acquitted Hillary Clinton\'s former campaign attorney Michael Sussmann on charges he lied to the FBI when he met with the bureau in September 2016 to share a tip about possible communications between Mr Trump\'s business and a Russian bank.\n\nMr Durham\'s investigation was dealt yet another major set-back just a few months later, when a jury in Virginia acquitted Russian researcher Igor Danchenko of charges that he lied to the FBI when he was interviewed about the sources of information he provided that became part of a document known as the Steele dossier.\n\nThat document, penned by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, made allegations about ties between Mr Trump\'s 2016 election campaign and Russia and contained salacious details — many of which were never substantiated.\n\nAn investigation by the Justice Department\'s inspector general later found that the FBI improperly continued to rely on unsubstantiated allegations in the Steele dossier when it applied for court-approved warrant applications to monitor the communications of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nMr Durham did secure a successful guilty plea against former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith, who was singled out in the inspector general\'s report, for altering an email that was used to justify a government wiretap application for Mr Page.\n\nMr Durham\'s report echoed many of the concerns the inspector general previously raised about the rigour of the FBI\'s process for applying to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for wiretap applications.\n\nThe FBI has since implemented numerous reforms to the process.'}}",90.83333333333333,2

He said New York Attorney General Letitia James ""should be ashamed of herself.""\n\nOver the course of four hours on the stand on Monday, Trump repeatedly strayed from the questions, earning reprimands from New York Judge Arthur Engoron on several occasions. The judge, who was seated just feet away from Trump, will decide the outcome of the bench trial himself.\n\nThe case stems from a $250 million civil lawsuit filed by James\' office, which accused Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives of a yearslong fraud scheme. The state alleges the defendants inflated the value of the company\'s assets and Trump\'s personal wealth to obtain better terms on loans and insurance. The attorney general is seeking to recoup $250 million and limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York. The defendants have all denied wrongdoing, and Trump has repeatedly accused James of pursuing him for political reasons.\n\nIn his testimony, the former president and current front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination stood by the valuations of various Trump properties that other co-defendants have sought to distance themselves from.\n\n""The numbers of my net worth are substantially more than the numbers reflected on the financial statements,"" he said in one exchange. ""Therefore you have no case.""\n\nTrump\'s testimony\n\nTrump arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan shortly before 10 a.m. and made brief remarks, reiterating his criticism of the trial.\n\n""It\'s a terrible, terrible thing. These are political operatives that I\'m going to be dealing with right now,"" Trump said. ""It\'s a very sad situation for our country.""\n\nOutside the courtroom, James predicted Trump would ""engage in name-calling, taunts and race-baiting,"" but said, ""At the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friend, don\'t lie.""\n\nTrump then took the stand. Kevin Wallace, a lawyer from the attorney general\'s office, kicked off the questioning by asking Trump about a trust he established to manage his assets before he entered the White House. When he left office in 2021, he took control of the trust, only to relinquish it again in July 2021. He testified that he did so because of increasing legal pressure from a number of fronts.\n\n""You and about every other Democrat district attorney, A.G., and U.S. attorney were coming at me from 15 different sides, all Democrats, Trump haters,"" Trump said, adding that he had ""great confidence"" in his son to manage his assets.\n\nTrump repeatedly gave long-winded answers to questions about the valuations of various Trump Organization properties, and Engoron\'s patience soon wore thin. Christopher Kise, one of Trump\'s attorneys, encouraged Engoron to allow Trump to give answers in his own way.\n\n""With this witness I would suggest it\'s far more efficient to listen to what he has to say and take it in,"" Kise said, prompting laughter from Wallace.\n\nEngoron\'s voice rose as his anger seemed to boil over, and his microphone struggled to handle the sudden change in volume.\n\n""No, I\'m not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron said, his voice rising. ""I\'m here to hear him answer questions. Sit down!""\n\nEngoron said he was considering drawing negative conclusions from Trump\'s testimony.\n\n""We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can\'t, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can,"" Engoron said.\n\nAfter a break, Wallace posed questions about the valuations of Trump\'s and his company\'s properties, including Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower in Manhattan and an upstate New York estate known as Seven Springs. Trump defended the financial statements listing their supposed value, saying that even those valuations that have been determined to be inflated were too low. He added that he would not be willing to sell several properties because they were worth so much.\n\nJames\' office says the documents, known as statements of financial condition, inflated his net worth by billions. Trump said the documents included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies.\n\n""The disclaimer clause says if there\'s a mistake, if there\'s something, don\'t rely on it,"" Trump said. ""[The disclaimers] always hold up in court, except maybe this court.""\n\nTrump also insisted that increases in property values over time justified overvaluations in the past, an argument Engoron has previously rejected. Discussing property valuations for 2014, Trump said, ""If you carry that forward to 2021, all of those valuations were low.""\n\nTrump became particularly animated during discussion of Mar-a-Lago, the Florida club where he resides for most of the year. Engoron\'s pretrial ruling finding Trump liable for fraud noted that the local assessor valued Mar-a-Lago at $18 million, while in documents Trump valued it at hundreds of millions more. The former president said in his testimony that he believes it\'s worth as much as $1.5 billion.\n\nThe property is ""deed-restricted"" and cannot be used as a residence, which experts previously told CBS News limits its value. Trump said he agreed to the deed restriction for tax purposes, acknowledging that the lower assessed value limits the property\'s tax burden. He then described a hypothetical scheme in which a person calls their own home a club to save money on taxes.\n\n""There are a lot of advantages to the club status, the smartest thing to do would be to have a club and have one member,"" Trump said.\n\nHe later argued about whether it was accurate to value one of his Scottish golf clubs as if he has built nearly 2,500 new homes on it, when in fact he has built none and is limited by contract to just under 1,500.\n\n""At some point maybe in my very old age I\'ll go there and do the most beautiful thing you\'ve ever seen,"" the 77-year-old said.\n\nLater in the day, Trump described a loan related to Chicago property as having been ""long since gone."" Pressed on that detail, he conceded it was actually paid off ""very recently.""\n\nWallace then asked, ""Are you aware that the Trump Chicago loan was paid off last week?""\n\nTrump said he was, and that, ""my son recommended it,"" referring to Eric Trump, who testified about that and other properties on Nov. 2 and 3.\n\nTrump said his company has begun looking into whether it needs to change internal policies as a result of the state\'s investigation.\n\n""There will be recommendations made, and we will perhaps let you know what those recommendations are, it wouldn\'t bother me to let you know about it. But we have asked,"" Trump said, adding that Eric Trump has been in charge of communicating with accountants and lawyers about that process.\n\nHe was excused from the witness stand shortly before 3:30 p.m., with the defense team declining to pose questions.\n\nThe fraud trial\n\nTrump is accused in the civil suit of being the primary beneficiary of a scheme to fraudulently portray his wealth as far greater than it is, and his properties as far more valuable, in order to get undeservedly favorable loan and insurance terms. The judge in the case has already found Trump, his two adult sons and their company liable for fraud, determining that the scheme led to hundreds of millions in unearned profits.\n\nThe trial is focused on other allegations, including falsification of business records, conspiracy and insurance fraud, as well as disgorgement — the exact amount of ""ill-gotten gains"" the Trumps must pay the state.\n\nTrump and his company have for more than a year blamed their former outside accountants, Mazars USA, for any inaccuracies in their statements of financial condition, essentially a snapshot of Trump\'s wealth. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump reiterated that defense in testimony last week, saying they ""trusted"" internal and external accounting teams.\n\nBut their former Mazars accountant testified in October that his firm merely compiled reams of financial information provided to them by the Trumps and their company.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking $250 million and sanctions designed to limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York, including permanently barring Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director in any business in the state.\n\nReporting contributed by Katrina Kaufman.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/us/key-moments-trumps-testimony-new-york-fraud-trial-2023-11-06/', 'Headline': ""Key moments from Trump's testimony at New York fraud trial"", 'Snippet': 'Nov 6 (Reuters) - Donald Trump testified for roughly four hours on Monday at his civil fraud trial in New York, as the former U.S. president used the witness stand to boast about his wealth and lash out at the judge overseeing the case.

During the course of his testimony, Trump frequently took the opportunity to offer his own opinions about the case.\n\nTrump’s Monday appearance before the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan marks his second time in the witness box during the proceedings being overseen by Justice Arthur Engoron. In late October, Trump was asked to testify about prior comments he made on social media about the judge’s law clerk. After offering an excuse, Engoron found the witness “not credible” and warned him not to make such comments again.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the 45th president’s first foray into giving under-oath answers actually germane to the long-running lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\n1. The judge offered himself as a punching bag\n\nKevin Wallace led the questioning for the attorney general’s office and early on gave Trump a lot of leeway to elaborate on his answers. But that leeway quickly led to a judicial upbraiding.\n\nAfter one question, Trump downplayed the importance banks paid to his financial statements, saying bankers were typically more interested in securing the overall deals with the Trump Organization.\n\n“They just weren’t a very important element in a bank’s decision-making process, and we’ll explain this as this very crazy trial goes along,” the witness said, according to a courtroom report by MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin.\n\nIn response to the characterization of the trial, Engoron told Trump not to give speeches during his answers. In response to that, Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise complained that the questions were open-ended and arguably called for a narrative response.\n\nAfter moving on to one of the specific contested financial statements, Trump acknowledged the document in question assigns responsibility for its accuracy to himself – but said if there were any issues, they would have or should have been caught by his accounting firm. Asked further to explain what, if anything, he personally did to ensure the accuracy of such documents in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Trump began to speechify again.\n\nRemarking that the financial statements were signed off on too long ago for him to remember, the witness complained that the vintage of those forms also brings them well outside the statute of limitations. Then, he criticized the judge directly, saying: “I’m sure the judge will rule against me because he always rules against me,” according to a courtroom report by The Messenger’s Adam Klasfeld.\n\nIn response, Engoron said it was not true that he always rules against Trump, asked Kise if the criticism was necessary, and then spoke to Trump directly: “You can attack me – you can do whatever you want. But please just answer the questions.”\n\n2. The witness concedes the valuations were off\n\nThe crux of the matter before the court are inflated valuations of properties owned by Trump and the Trump Organization. In late September, buoyed by thousands of pages of exhibits filed by the attorney general’s office, Engoron determined that many financial statements filed by Trump and his family’s business empire were fraudulent – deciding a motion of summary judgment in the state’s favor.\n\nSeveral ancillary issues, however, remain – including the amount of the disgorgement, or fine, that the Trump Organization must pay – along with various other potential penalties. And, key to many of the extant legal issues left for the court to determine is the intent and culpability of other named defendants. In other words, the judge is currently assessing who, exactly, was responsible for the fraud – and, the extent to which that fraud was willingly committed in violation of New York State law governing for-profit organizations.\n\nTrump, for his part, conceded that several valuations were incorrect – in both directions – but insisted those weren’t material to the deals he was making and, in any event, couldn’t be considered fraud.\n\n“Do you remember thinking some of those valuations were off?” Wallace asked the witness.\n\nIn response, he said, Mar-a-Lago was “very underestimated.” He added that he personally felt his properties on 40 Wall Street and a golf course in Miami were also undervalued but didn’t raise an issue with how those values were reflected on the documents because he “didn’t care.”\n\nTrump also replied that in his opinion, an apartment in the Trump Tower in Manhattan was overvalued, but that it only takes one person to pay the asking price and buy it for the value to be valid.\n\n“I think I was certainly more expert than anyone else, so if somebody would ask me or if I had an opinion, I would give it,” he reportedly said.\n\n3. The judge snapped at Trump and his attorneys – and Trump’s attorneys snapped back\n\nAs for opinions, Trump had a lot to share on the stand – eventually annoying the court by giving longwinded answers to yes-or-no questions.\n\nIn response to one question, Trump gave a sarcastic caricature of the attorney general’s case against him. That answer was stricken.\n\nJudge Engoron then recommended: “Mr. Kise, can you control your client? This is not a political rally…Maybe you should have a talk with him right now.”\n\nEventually, Kise threw up his hands and replied: “You’re in control of the courtroom, not me.”\n\nWhile giving another opinion about his own business acumen, Trump ran over questioning by Wallace and continued to boast about his property management techniques at one Fifth Avenue location in particular. That didn’t sit well with Engoron. The judge attempted to interject by saying “excuse me.” Trump then told the judge to “hold on” and continued discussing his capitalistic savvy.\n\nFinally, the judge had enough.\n\nAddressing Kise, Engoron instructed the defense attorney to “control your witness” and threatened to dismiss Trump from the stand and, instead, “draw every negative inference” from his absence.\n\n“I beseech you to control him,” the judge added.\n\nKise urged the court against such a course of action.\n\n“I’d urge the court to take in all information possible,” Trump’s attorney reportedly replied. “You have on the stand a candidate for president of the United States; the most efficient way to get through this is to listen to what he has to say…about what happened and why there’s no intent to mislead anyone. I believe that’s highly relevant and highly probative.”\n\nAnother Trump attorney, Alina Habba, then spoke up, somewhat more aggressively defending her client, advising the judge that if the state wants better responses from the witness, they shouldn’t ask open-ended questions.\n\n“We are not here to hear what he has to say,” Engoron explained. “We are here to listen to him answer questions.”\n\nHabba took direct issue with that, telling the judge: “Yes, you are here to listen to what he has to say.”\n\nIn response, the judge shouted at Habba and told her to sit down – before telling the state to proceed with questioning the witness.\n\n4. Trump complained about the judge’s work – and then posted about it\n\n“This is a very unfair trial,” the witness said after his lawyer was shouted down by the court. “Very, very unfair, and I hope the public is watching it.”\n\nAnd, during a recess, Trump made sure to highlight the blowup between Habba and Engoron.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, a conservative social media outlet owned by the former president, Trump posted a meme containing an image of the judge and his remark about not wanting to hear what Trump “has to say.”\n\nTrump, of course, has also been a voluble critic of James and her office. During his testimony, he opined that the attorney general was essentially targeting him in order to make a name for herself. In the process of this criticism, he suggested she had little personal knowledge of the ins and outs of New York real estate by questioning her basic grasp of geography.\n\n“She doesn’t know what 40 Wall Street is worth,” Trump said. “She doesn’t even know where 40 Wall Street is.”\n\nDuring the lunch recess, James made her own social media post in response to the courtroom antics in lower Manhattan on Monday.\n\n5. Trump wags his finger and highlights his wealth\n\nA constant theme throughout the testimony provided by the ex-president and current presidential candidate on Monday was the idea that he was being targeted for political reasons.\n\nIn support of this argument, Trump repeatedly stressed the end results of what happened between banks and the Trump Organization: everybody made money.\n\nBanks who lent Trump’s business money “got all their money back” and loans were always “paid off in full,” he testified.\n\n“There was no loss of money,” the witness reportedly said during questioning after the lunchtime recess. “They made a lot of money, and everyone is trying to figure out why you’re doing it…I understand it. It’s called ‘politics.'”\n\nLaunching into another speech-in-miniature, Trump called Wallace and the state’s case against him “a disgrace” and continued to muse about the political origins of the attorney general’s complaint.\n\n“It’s election interference because you want to keep me in this courthouse all day long,” he reportedly complained.\n\nProsecutors argue that the fraudulent documents were material, however, because the figures included in them often resulted in Trump receiving favorable interest rates on the loans.\n\n“Everybody got their money in full, and now you’re assuming the statements are phony,” Trump said earlier on.\n\nIf anything, Trump testified, the statements of financial condition likely underestimated “how rich” the Trump Organization really was when they were filed\n\n“I became president because of my brand,” Trump reportedly said. “If I wanted to build up a statement because of my brand, all I would have to do is add brand value and my financial statement would be very very substantial.”\n\nLater on, Wallace repeatedly pressed the witness on various loan agreements that required him to provide “true and correct” financial statements – focusing on language that necessitated certain high-threshold cash reserves.\n\n“The net worth of me was far greater than the financial statements,” Trump reportedly said in response. “So I don’t know what you’re getting at.”\n\nAsked point blank, however, whether the financial statements inflated his assets, the witness returned to a favored defense. Trump argued that so-called “worthless clause” disclaimers – clauses that advise caution in interpreting financial data – render any financial misstatements less significant than the state is making them out to be.\n\nSuch disclaimers, the witness said, “go on forever.”\n\nPerhaps feeling left out from all of the prior drama, the state’s attorney then got in a rare zinger of his own.\n\n“That clause isn’t the only thing that goes on forever,” Wallace reportedly deadpanned.""}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.fox5ny.com/news/donald-trump-witness-stand-testifies-fraud-trial', 'Headline': 'Trump lashes out from the witness stand at judge, NY ... - FOX 5 New York', 'Snippet': 'Trump\'s long-awaited testimony about property valuations and financial statements was punctuated by personal jabs at state Judge Arthur Engoron, who he said was biased against him, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whom he derided as a ""political hack.""', 'Full_text': 'A defiant Donald Trump sparred with a New York judge and slammed the state attorney general suing him Monday, using the witness stand at his civil fraud trial to defend his riches and lash out at a case that imperils his real estate empire.\n\nThe former president’s barbed testimony spurred the judge to admonish, ""This is not a political rally.""\n\nTrump\'s long-awaited testimony about property valuations and financial statements was punctuated by personal jabs at state Judge Arthur Engoron, who he said was biased against him, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whom he derided as a ""political hack."" He proudly boasted of his real estate business — ""I\'m worth billions of dollars more than the financial statements"" — and disputed claims that he had deceived banks and insurers.\n\nFeatured\n\n""This is the opposite of fraud,"" he declared. Referring to James, a Democrat whose office brought the lawsuit, he said, ""The fraud is her.""\n\nThe testy exchanges and frequent rebukes from the judge underscored Trump’s unwillingness to adapt his famously freewheeling rhetorical style to a formal courtroom setting governed by rules of evidence and legal protocol. His presence on the stand was a vivid reminder of the legal troubles he faces as he vies to reclaim the White House in 2024.\n\nIt also functioned as a campaign platform for the former president and leading Republican presidential candidate to raise anew to supporters his claims of political persecution at the hands of government lawyers and judges.\n\nFeatured\n\n""People are sick and tired of what’s happening. I think it is a very sad day for America,"" Trump told reporters outside the courtroom after roughly three-and-a-half hours on the stand.\n\nThe fraud case doesn’t carry the prospect of prison as Trump\'s upcoming criminal cases do. But its allegations of financial impropriety cut to the very heart of the brand he spent decades crafting. Engoron has already ruled that Trump committed fraud by inflating his financial statements, putting the the ex-president’s future control of Trump Tower and his other marquee properties into question.\n\nThe non-jury trial addresses other claims in the lawsuit brought by James against Trump, his company and top executives, including his eldest sons. She wants the defendants to fork over what she claims is more than $300 million in ill-gotten gains and to be banned from doing business in New York.\n\nFeatured\n\nThe civil trial is one of numerous legal proceedings facing Trump as he runs for a second term, including federal and state charges accusing him of crimes including illegally hoarding classified documents and scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election. His legal and political strategies have now become completely intertwined as he hopscotches between campaign events and court hearings, a schedule that will only intensify once his criminal trials begin.\n\nTrump has been particularly engaged in his fraud trial, aggrieved by the suggestion that he’s worth less than he’s claimed.\n\n""I’m worth billions of dollars more than the financial statements,"" he said Monday on the stand, telling a state lawyer, ""You go around and try and demean me and try and hurt me, probably for political reasons.""\n\nFeatured\n\nHis testimony got off to a contentious start, with the judge turning to Trump’s attorney at one point and saying: ""I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t, I will.""\n\nThe courtroom at 60 Centre Street had already become a familiar destination for Trump, who spent days over the past month voluntarily seated at the defense table, observing the proceedings. He took the stand once before — unexpectedly and briefly — after he was accused of violating a partial gag order. He denied violating the rules, but Engoron disagreed and fined him anyway.\n\nHis turn as a witness gave him the biggest opportunity yet to respond to allegations against him.\n\nSummoned by lawyers for the state, Trump repeatedly bristled at the suggestion that he had ever intended to defraud financial institutions. He said he had been misquoted or taken too literally in past public comments about his business dealings and his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, and said disclaimers in his financial statements covered any missteps. He returned to a familiar position that no one had been victimized, though state lawyers contend that Trump was able to get lower interest rates and other benefits because of the wealth reflected on his financial statements.\n\n""Not one bank lost money. Not one insurance company lost money,"" he declared.\n\nTensions between Engoron and Trump — already on display in recent weeks, when the judge fined him a total of $15,000 for incendiary outside-of-court comments — were evident early on Monday when the ex-president was repeatedly scolded about the length and content of his answers.\n\nEngoron, who determined in a ruling earlier that Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame, will decide the non-jury case. He cautioned at one point that he was prepared to draw ""negative inferences"" against the former president if he failed to rein in his answers.\n\n""I do not want to hear everything this witness has to say. He has a lot to say that has nothing to do with the case or the questions,"" the judge said.\n\nDespite the testy back-and-forth early in the day, Trump was later able to veer into expansive answers without anyone cutting him off, using the opportunity to rail against James, the judge and the proceedings in general.\n\n""I think that she’s a political hack, and I think she used this case to try and become governor, and she used it successfully to become attorney general. I think it’s a disgrace that this case is going on,"" Trump said.\n\nOf Engoron, Trump said, ""He ruled against me, and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me.""\n\nJames, who was in the courtroom, stared straight ahead at Trump as he spoke and was seen chuckling when Trump suggested she didn\'t know anything about one of his properties, which is located across the street from her office. Afterward, she told reporters: ""He rambled. He hurled insults. But we expected that.""\n\nMonday’s testimony centered on the core of the allegations by the state attorney general: that Trump and his company intentionally inflated property values and deceived banks and insurers in the pursuit of business deals and loans.\n\nEchoing the stance taken by two of his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric, in their own testimony last week, Trump sought to downplay his direct involvement in preparing and assessing financial statements that the attorney general claims were grossly inflated and fraudulent.\n\n""All I did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary for the accountants to do the statements,"" he said. As for the results, ""I would look at them, I would see them and maybe on some occasions, I would have some suggestions.""\n\nHe also played down the significance of the statements, which went to banks and others to secure financing and deals.\n\n""Banks didn’t find them very relevant, and they had a disclaimer clause -- you would call it a worthless statement clause,"" he said, insisting that after decades in real estate, ""I probably know banks as well as anybody. … I know what they look at. They look at the deal, they look at the location.""\n\nHe complained that his 2014 financial statements shouldn’t be a subject of the lawsuit at all.\n\n""First of all it’s so long ago, it’s well beyond the statute of limitations,"" Trump said before turning on Engoron, saying he allowed state lawyers to pursue claims involving such years-old documents ""because he always rules against me.""\n\nEngoron said, ""You can attack me in whichever way you want, but please answer the questions.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217973766/trump-witness-claims-no-evidence-of-fraud-in-civil-case', 'Headline': 'Trump witness claims no evidence of fraud in civil case : NPR', 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump looked on today as an expert witness bolstered a key element of the former president\'s defense.

Hey, Andrea.\n\nANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.\n\nCHANG: OK, so it sounds like Trump got some backup for his defense today.\n\nBERNSTEIN: Yes. Trump\'s lawyers called, as their penultimate witness, Dr. Eli Bartov, a highly credentialed accounting professor from New York University who had once served as an expert witness for the New York attorney general\'s office.\n\nCHANG: (Laughter) OK.\n\nBERNSTEIN: And Bartov just jumped right in saying, quote, ""there is no evidence whatsoever for accounting fraud."" He sounded like a classroom professor, repeating phrases and saying things like parts of the attorney general\'s complaint, quote, ""border on the absurd"" and that, quote, ""no valuations are objective because they are, by definition, opinions."" He added, if somebody tells you an evaluation is objective, they need to have their head examined. And the witness said that a disclaimer in Trump\'s statements of financial condition makes it clear that no one should take them at face value, and this was so obvious even his 9-year-old granddaughter could understand.\n\nCHANG: Interesting testimony. OK, so how did the AG\'s office respond to all of that?\n\nBERNSTEIN: They really wanted to make it clear that Professor Bartov is not an expert in banking or real estate valuations. At one point, Assistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace objected saying, quote, ""this is pure speculation from somebody they hired to say whatever they want,"" at which point Bartov turned to Wallace and said, quote, ""you should be ashamed. You make up allegations, and you say I say whatever I want. You should be ashamed of yourself talking to me like that,"" which is, of course, highly unusual...\n\nCHANG: (Laughter).\n\nBERNSTEIN: ...For a witness. This was right before lunch. And I did catch Trump lawyer Alina Habba smiling as she turned to leave.\n\nCHANG: And am I understanding this correctly? Trump stayed all day to hear this witness.\n\nBERNSTEIN: Yes, even though it got quite repetitive. Trump knows that when he\'s in the courtroom, we, the press, are there. And we heard Professor Bartov saying the kinds of things that Trump likes to say like, I\'ve never seen a financial statement that provided so much detail. And then, of course, there are all those TV cameras out in the hallway capturing Donald Trump\'s words when he leaves and when he says things like, he should be in Iowa campaigning. Now, of course, he could be in Iowa. He is here fully by his own choice.\n\nCHANG: So what\'s next for Trump in this trial?\n\nBERNSTEIN: So in action outside of this courtroom, Trump got some relief today when an appeals court panel affirmed a judge\'s decision from earlier this fall that the dissolution of Trump\'s business would remain on hold until this trial is over. You might remember that before the trial even began, the judge found on one cause of action for the attorney general and said that Trump would have to start canceling his business certificates. But that was paused.\n\nAnd Trump has also lost his efforts, so far, to overturn a gag order that prevents him from disparaging the judge\'s clerk. Trump\'s lawyers had complained that this violated Trump\'s First Amendment rights, but both the trial judge and an appeals panel have ruled otherwise, which means when Trump testifies on Monday, he won\'t be able to go after the judge\'s clerk from the witness stand. That\'ll be the last day of the defense case - after that, a day of rebuttal, followed by briefs and final arguments in court in January; sometime mid-next-month, maybe just before or after the Iowa caucuses, a verdict.\n\nCHANG: A lot coming up.

Trump\'s team tried to show he did nothing wrong, that the statements were largely accurate and that any mistakes weren\'t his fault. Along the way were plenty of spectacles, with testimony from the former president and his family members, gag orders, fines, angry exchanges and dramatic showdowns.\n\nHere\'s a look at some key moments from the trial.\n\nA former president on the witness stand\n\nWhile Trump abruptly decided not to take the stand in his defense earlier this week, the former president spent a remarkable day on the witness stand as part of the AG\'s case last month, where he repeatedly ripped into James and Engoron.\n\n“I think she’s a political hack,” Trump said of James, also labeling Engoron a “very hostile judge, extremely hostile judge.”\n\nTrump said he was especially upset with Engoron\'s pretrial finding that Trump had committed persistent fraud.\n\n“He ruled against me and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me, nothing about me,” Trump said of Engoron, who has overseen legal disputes between Trump and the attorney general’s office for years.\n\nA spat over Mar-a-Lago\n\nOut of all the fraud claims lodged by the AG, the one that appeared to bother Trump the most was one involving his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe AG\'s office noted that Trump valued Mar-a-Lago at between $426 million and $612 million on his financial statements between 2011 and 2021. The Palm Beach County Assessor, meanwhile, appraised the property\'s market value to be between $18 million and $27 million in the same time period. The AG\'s office also noted the financial statements valued the property as a private home, while Trump had signed an agreement with the county that it could only be used as a social club.\n\nTrump repeatedly complained about the AG citing the tax valuation and Engoron\'s pretrial finding that not disclosing the club restriction was fraudulent. “The judge had it at $18 million. And it is worth, say, I say from 50 to 100 times more than that. So I don’t know how you got those numbers,” Trump testified, adding later that he thinks it\'s actually worth ""between a billion and a billion five.” He\'s also complained about the valuation to reporters in court on the days he\'s attended the trial, at political rallies and on his Truth Social website.\n\nThe second to last defense witness in the case, Palm Beach real estate broker Lawrence Moens, brought a video he shot of the property with him that he played during his testimony. He said he valued the property at over $1 billion, and invited the AG to tour the property in person. ""I’ll make sure he is not there when you come,"" he said, referring to Trump.\n\nTrump was slapped with a gag order, and penalized for defying it\n\nTrump attended several days of the trial, and some of his comments to reporters during breaks came back to bite him. On the second day of trial, Trump referred reporters to a post on his social media platform Truth Social, where he shared the identity of the judge\'s law clerk and falsely accused her of having a personal relationship with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\n“You saw what was just put out about Schumer and the principal clerk? That is disgraceful,” Trump said. The judge ordered the post be removed and issued a gag order barring Trump from talking about his court staff, saying such attacks ""are unacceptable, inappropriate and I won’t tolerate it."" He later fined Trump $5,000 after it was revealed the post was still on a campaign website weeks later and threatened further sanctions, including jail time.\n\nThe judge later expanded the gag order to include Trump\'s lawyers as well. Trump’s attorneys are appealing the gag orders and the fines against their client.\n\nTrump storms out of the courtroom\n\nOn Oct. 25, Engoron fined Trump another $10,000 after finding he told reporters outside the courtroom that Engoron is “a very partisan judge with a person who’s very partisan sitting alongside him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is.”\n\nThe judge took that as a reference to his law clerk, who sits next to him and who Trump had alleged was politically biased against him. He ordered Trump to take the witness stand, and he testified he was referring to that day\'s witness, his former attorney turned outspoken critic Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump has publicly called Cohen all sorts of names since he turned against him, but ""partisan"" has not been one of his insults. The judge said he found Trump\'s testimony ""not credible"" and fined him. ""Don’t do it again, or it will be worse,” Engoron warned.\n\nA short time later, Trump stormed out of the courtroom- seeming to surprise his lawyers and his Secret Service agents.\n\nTrump reunited with an old friend-turned-foe\n\nMichael Cohen\'s testimony was the first time he\'d come face to face with his former boss in five years. James has said she launched her investigation into Trump after Cohen testified about his business practices to the House Oversight Committee on Capitol Hill in 2019.\n\nTrump came to court for Cohen\'s testimony and appeared to be enjoying himself while his attorney Alina Habba got Cohen to acknowledge he\'d lied under oath in a previous court case. Cohen, who said he was involved in preparing some of the financial statements, also said Trump never directly told him to inflate values. Trump used that statement to declare victory in the case to reporters and his lawyers asked the judge to rule in the case in their favor.\n\nUnder further questioning from the AG, Cohen testified it wasn\'t Trump\'s style to make direct requests. He compared Trump to a “mob boss” who tells you what he wants without directly telling you.\n\nFormer accountant blames the Trumps\n\nThe AG\'s first witness was the Trump\'s former accountant, Donald Bender. Bender testified that he compiled the financial statements, called statements of financial condition, using information and valuations provided to him by executives at Trump\'s company, the Trump Organization. He said he relied on company officials, including former CFO Allen Weisselberg and senior vice president Jeff McConney, to provide him with accurate information. Asked at one point if he\'d subsequently learned the company had been holding information back from him, Bender said, “Yes.” He said that they’d failed to turn over “paper documents over a number of years.”\n\nWeisselberg and McConney testified as well. All three had also testified in the Manhattan district attorney\'s criminal tax fraud trial against the Trump Organization last year. The company was convicted and fined and Weisselberg, who pleaded guilty to falsifying business records, was sentenced to five months in jail.\n\nTrump family blames the accountants\n\nThe former president, his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., Weisselberg and other company officials all pointed a finger back at Bender and their other accountants during their testimony.\n\n""All I did is authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary for the accountants to do a statement. In other words, we supplied them with what they needed. And if they didn\'t get it, they wouldn\'t do the statement,"" Trump said.\n\nTrump Jr., who\'s now running the company with his brother, said “I rely on the accountants” for the statements. “They were intimately involved in every aspect” of the statements, he said.\n\nEric Trump said, “I relied on a very big accounting office. I relied on one of the biggest accounting firms in the country. And I relied on a great legal team, and when they gave me comfort that the statement was perfect, I was more than happy to execute it.” He also suggested the statements weren\'t the type of thing he paid much attention to. “I pour concrete. I operate properties. I don’t focus on appraisals,” he said.\n\nIvanka Trump, a former executive at the company, also testified during the AG\'s case and said she was not involved with the statements, but assumed they were documents that ""he would work on with his own accountants.""\n\nTrump accounting expert says \'no evidence\' of fraud\n\nThe final defense witness was Eli Bartov, an accounting professor at NYU. Bartov, who was paid almost $900,000 for his work on the case by Trump\'s company and his political action committee, testified that “my analysis shows the statements of financial condition for all the years were not materially misstated.”\n\n“My main finding is that there is no evidence whatsoever for any accounting fraud,” he said.\n\nThe judge asked him whether his expert opinion from an accounting perspective was that the AG’s claims had no merit. “Absolutely,” he replied.\n\nTrump, who attended the trial on the first day of Bartov\'s testimony, called Bartov “a very strong witness, a very powerful witness and a highly respected person.”\n\nA fond farewell\n\nAt the start of the last day of testimony Wednesday, Engoron said, “In a strange way. I am going to miss this trial. It has been an experience.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/highlights-of-donald-trump-s-hours-on-the-witness-stand-at-his-new-york-civil-fraud-trial-1.6635320', 'Headline': ""Highlights of Donald Trump's civil fraud trial testimony | CTV News"", 'Snippet': 'Former U.S. President Donald Trump waits to take the witness stand at New York Supreme Court, Monday, Nov. 6, 2023, in New York. (Curtis Means/Pool Photo via AP)', 'Full_text': 'NEW YORK -\n\nDonald Trump went off. Again and again. Making the witness stand at his civil fraud trial his podium, the former president laid into the judge who\'ll decide the case and the New York attorney general who\'s suing him.\n\nDuring 3 1/2 hours of testimony on Monday, the Republican denied Attorney General Letitia James\' allegations that he duped banks by exaggerating his wealth on financial statements used to make deals and secure loans.\n\n""There was no victim. There was no anything,"" he said.\n\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\nHe bragged about his riches, saying he has ""a lot of cash"" and described one of the grown sons he put in charge of his company as a ""hard working boy."" He said of his priorities while president: ""My threshold was China, Russia and keeping our country safe.""\n\nTrump\'s often verbose responses -- replete with anecdotes about development projects, the intricacies of property valuations and complaints that he was a victim of a ""political witch hunt"" -- led a frustrated Judge Arthur Engoron to warn: ""This is not a political rally.""\n\nHere are some highlights from Trump\'s day on the witness stand:\n\n\'A VERY UNFAIR TRIAL\'\n\nTrump made his grievances a focal point of his testimony, amplifying complaints the 2024 Republican front-runner has made for weeks in front of TV cameras outside the courtroom.\n\nHe directed a lot of his ire against the judge, who issued a decision before the trial even began holding Trump liable for fraud.\n\n""He ruled against me without knowing anything about me,"" Trump testified. ""He ruled against me, and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me, nothing about me. I think it\'s fraudulent, the decision. I think it\'s fraudulent. The fraud is on the court, not on me.""\n\nDuring the trial, the judge has fined Trump $15,000 for violating a limited gag order barring attacks on court staff. But nothing in the order bars the former U.S. president from criticizing the judge.\n\nEngoron did try to clamp down on Trump\'s speechifying during his testimony.\n\n""I\'m not here to hear what he has to say. I\'m here to hear him answer questions,"" Engoron told one of Trump\'s lawyers. The former U.S. president retorted: ""This is a very unfair trial, very, very. And I hope the public is watching it.""\n\nEngoron\'s admonition only gave Trump more ammunition to claim he was being mistreated. Trump later posted Engoron\'s ""not here to hear what he has to say"" comment to his Truth Social account.\n\nOn the witness stand, Trump suggested the judge should\'ve showed him deference as a former president, testifying, ""How do you rule against somebody and call them a fraud, as the president of the United States, who did a great job?""\n\nSTATEMENTS \'WEREN\'T VERY BADLY NEEDED\'\n\nIn defending his business practices, Trump sought to downplay the importance of the annual statements of financial condition at issue in the case. He testified that the documents, which listed values for his properties and assets, were ""nice to see"" but ""weren\'t very badly needed"" to obtain financing and make deals.\n\nEven when banks required Trump to provide copies of his financial statements as part of a loan agreement, he testified that they really wanted to know if he had enough cash to cover the loan. Trump testified that he typically kept $300 million to $400 million in the bank, saying, ""I\'ve had a lot of cash for a long time.""\n\n""They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to,"" Trump testified. ""They looked at the deal. They looked at the asset. If it is real estate, they looked at the location.""\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump waits to take the witness stand at New York Supreme Court, Monday, Nov. 6, 2023, in New York. (Curtis Means/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nRetired Deutsche Bank official Nicholas Haigh testified earlier in the trial that the bank, which loaned Trump hundreds of millions of dollars, would look to his financial statements to ensure that his ""financial strength is being maintained.""\n\nTrump testified that he relied on two longtime Trump Organization executives and an outside accounting firm to prepare his financial statements. He said ex-CFO Allen Weisselberg would give him a draft before each year\'s statement was finalized and that he\'d ""look it over and maybe have a suggestion.""\n\n""But it wasn\'t very important,"" Trump testified. ""You\'ve made it important. But it wasn\'t very important to me.""\n\nA \'VERY, VERY POWERFUL\' DISCLAIMER\n\nTrump testified that he had no qualms with how his financial statements turned out and that, if anything, they undervalued some of his properties. Regardless, he said, the statements had a ""disclaimer clause that was very, very powerful"" that absolved him and his company of responsibility.\n\nTrump said the disclaimer instructed banks and others: ""Do your own due diligence. Do your own work. Do your own study. Don\'t take anything from this statement for granted.""\n\nThe disclaimer said, among other things, that the financial statements weren\'t audited by outside accountants.\n\nTrump mentioned the disclaimer more than a dozen times, at one point irking Engoron, whose pretrial ruling found that the clause didn\'t insulate Trump from liability.\n\n""No, no, no. We are not going to hear about the disclaimer clause,"" the judge bellowed. ""If you want to know about the disclaimer clause, read my opinion again, or for the first time, perhaps.""\n\n""Well, you are wrong on the opinion,"" Trump responded.\n\n\'A VERY SAD THING\' FOR EX-CFO\n\nAs Trump wrapped up his testimony, he expressed sorrow for Weisselberg, his longtime finance chief who pleaded guilty and served jail time last year for evading taxes on pricey company-paid perks, including a Manhattan apartment, luxury cars and private school tuition for his grandchildren.\n\nAt a trial largely built on Weisselberg\'s testimony, Trump\'s company was convicted last year of helping executives dodge taxes on such perks. The Trump Organization was ordered to pay a $1.6 million fine.\n\n""It was a sad, very sad thing,"" Trump testified. ""People went after him viciously and violently because he happened to work for me.""\n\nTrump testified that he\'d learned of Weisselberg\'s tax misdeeds only through last year\'s trial, where the ex-executive testified that his schemes were unknown to his boss. Despite the revelation about his trusted lieutenant, Trump said he never thought to go back and review Weisselberg\'s work.\n\n""The education of his grandchildren -- that is going to be some kind of a breach where you want to put a man in jail? It\'s a very sad thing,"" Trump lamented.\n\n\'A DISGRACE\' AND \'DISTRACTIONS\'\n\nTrump looked away from Attorney General James and sneered as he walked past her on the way into court. On the witness stand, he tore into the Democrat, accusing her of pursuing him to advance her political career.\n\n""She\'s a political hack, and this a disgrace that a case like this is going on,"" Trump testified, adding that James ""should be ashamed of herself.""\n\nTrump also directed his enmity at Kevin Wallace, the lawyer from James\' office who was questioning him, saying: ""People like you go around and try and demean me and try and hurt me. Probably for political reasons. In her case, definitely for political reasons.""\n\nJames made a short-lived run for New York governor in 2021 before winning reelection as attorney general last year.\n\nOutside court Monday, James said Trump was ""engaging in distractions and engaging in name calling"" to steal attention from the evidence against him.\n\nAT MAR-A-LAGO, \'FOREVER\' ISN\'T NECESSARILY FOREVER\n\nTrump suggested he or his heirs could someday depart from a decades-old agreement that limits the use of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nTrump\'s financial statements have valued the sprawling Palm Beach club as high as $739 million, based on what James\' office argues is a false premise that it could be sold as a private residence. Real estate agents say it\'s possible it could fetch $1 billion as a home. Trump claims the property is now worth up to $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2002, Trump signed an agreement with the National Trust for Historic Preservation that limited Mar-a-Lago\'s use to a social club. From the stand, Trump argued that language in the document stating that he did ""intend to forever"" use the estate as a club didn\'t necessarily mean forever.\n\n""It doesn\'t say I will. It says `intend,""\' Trump testified, adding: ""I would, personally, never change it. If somebody later on, including my children, if they want to change it, I believe they would have a right to do that.""\n\nShown a 2003 article in The Palm Beach Post that quoted him saying ""it will forever be a club,"" Trump responded, ""I think that was said with bravado, as opposed to with legal intent.""\n\nTrump acknowledged benefiting from the deal, testifying that as a club ""you pay much less tax.""'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1c247874-bca4-408d-a539-93f5f113ce0b', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump delivers heated testimony in New York civil fraud trial', 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump played down the importance of the financial statements at the centre of a civil fraud lawsuit as he took a tumultuous turn on the witness stand that provoked several rebukes from the judge and transformed a New York courtroom into a rambunctious political theatre.', 'Full_text': 'The new FT Digital Edition: today’s FT, cover to cover on any device.

Can’t do it.”\n\nHe continued: “For God’s sake, whose side are you on? Whose side are you on? Look, you’re either on the side of a mob or the side of the police. You can’t be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. You can’t be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6th ‘patriots’. You can’t do it.”\n\nTwo days later, Mr Biden gave a primetime address in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the Constitution was drafted.\n\n“Too much of what’s happening in our country today is not normal,” he said, adding that the man he defeated nearly two years ago — former president Donald Trump — and his “Maga Republican” allies “represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic”.\n\n“That is a threat to this country,” he continued.\n\nIt’s not the first time Trump and crowd-size comparisons are part of the political conversation.\n\nPerhaps the first scandal of the Trump White House involved the then-president and his aides making dubious claims about the crowd size at Mr Trump’s January 2017 inauguration.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://heavy.com/news/biden-georgia-rally-how-many-crowd-photos/', 'Headline': ""Biden's Georgia Rally Attendance: See Crowd Size Photos - Heavy.com"", 'Snippet': 'Biden Held a Drive-in Rally Attended by About 500 Cars.

Marjorie Taylor Greene was also among the people scheduled to speak.\n\nOpinions about crowd size varied. Some in attendance said the crowd was “massive.” However, other reporters said the crowd was much smaller than Trump used to attract. Here’s a look at the various reports. It’s not known if local police will share an official estimate, but we will add it to this story if they do.\n\nStephen Fowler of GPB News (an NPR affiliate) attended the rally and estimated on Twitter that there were about 5,000 people in attendance. He wrote that it was “the smallest Trump rally I’ve ever covered here.” He said it was much smaller than the 20,000 to 30,000-size rallies that Trump had hosted in 2020.\n\nGreg Bluestein of Atlanta-Journal Constitution shared a photo during the rally indicating that the crowd behind the TV risers didn’t extend “as far as the eye could see,” as Trump had said it did.\n\nFowler also shared a photo of the crowd, which was large but didn’t extend quite as far back as past rally crowds have done.\n\nHowever, Joshua L. Jones of the Athens Banner-Herald tweeted that around 5:30 p.m. Eastern, there was a “massive crowd” at the rally, and shared a photo of a packed crowd.\n\nBurt Jones, a conservative running for Lieutenant Governor, described the crowd as “huge.”\n\nTrump quickly began his speech by calling the current Governor Brian Kemp a “RINO,” as he supported one of Kemp’s opponents. He commented that he was angry that he had supported Kemp in the past.\n\nFowler later shared a photo showing the crowd differences between 8:50, 8:20, and 7:20. He said the cold and windy weather was leading some to leave early, while Trump was still speaking.\n\nTrump also commented to attendees that he believed Georgia was “red as hell” and voting for Perdue would be “a vote for this country.”\n\nAt one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz said he would nominate Trump to be the Speaker of the House.\n\nThis happened while Trump was bringing some of the candidates he endorsed, along with others, to speak on the stage with him.\n\nTrump Has Two More Rallies Scheduled\n\nTrump has two more rallies scheduled over the next two weeks, according to his website. A rally in Washington, Michigan, is taking place on April 2 at 7 p.m. Eastern at the Michigan Star Sports Center. And a rally in Selma, North Carolina, is taking place on April 9 at 7 p.m. Eastern at The Farm at 95.\n\nTrump’s first rally of 2022 was in Florence, Arizona in mid-January. Trump held a September rally in Georgia. He also held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, in October 2021, a rally in Alabama in August 2021, and an Ohio rally in June 2021. He also held a rally in Conroe, Texas, in January that was attended by tens of thousands, according to media at the event.\n\nIn his August Alabama rally, he was booed after telling the people present to take the vaccines. He replied: “You know what? I believe totally in your freedoms, I do. You have to do what you have to do. But, I recommend take the vaccines, I did it, it’s good. Take the vaccines.”\n\nTrump has not yet announced if he is running in the 2024 presidential election. However, he did tell the crowd during his speech in South Carolina that “we may have to run again,” and added “we will take back the White House.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/dec/21/donald-trump-rally-spotlighted-biden-trump/', 'Headline': 'PolitiFact | Donald Trump’s rally spotlighted the Biden, Trump ...', 'Snippet': 'However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.

That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.', 'Full_text': 'Before former President Donald Trump spoke for 90 minutes in Durham, New Hampshire, his team compared Trump’s record with President Joe Biden’s record by projecting a series of statistics on the wall.\n\nThe images shown Dec. 16 had the tagline ""Better off with Trump"" and covered mortgage payments, mortgage rates and inflation.\n\nHere’s a fact-check of three statements. The Trump campaign did not answer an inquiry for this article.\n\nSome of the statistics cited on projections at Donald Trump’s rally Dec. 16, 2023, in Durham, N.H. (Rebecca Catalanello/PolitiFact)\n\n""Under Joe Biden, we’ve had a three-year inflation rate of 20%.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe standard inflation measure, the consumer price index, has risen by 17.2% since January 2021, when Biden took office. That was an increase over three years, so the annual inflation rate was lower — about 5.9% per year during Biden’s presidency.\n\nRising wages have helped consumers manage some of this increase in prices.\n\nA standard wage measure, average hourly earnings of all private-sector employees, has risen by 14% during Biden’s presidency, or about 4.8% per year. That means wages are still trailing inflation by about 1.1% a year, but it’s a smaller gap than Trump’s headline number.\n\nThe time frame for the calculation also matters.\n\nAs inflation has cooled over the past year, wage gains have narrowed the cumulative shortfall from inflation. Since November 2022, inflation has risen by 3.1%, but wages have risen by 4%. If the pattern holds, wage growth during Biden’s presidency may soon surpass the increase in prices.\n\nAlso, Americans are in a better place than they were on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, which started during Trump’s last year in office. Since February 2020, the last full month before the pandemic hit, inflation has increased by 18.8%, while wages have increased by 19.4%.\n\n""After three years of Bidenomics, the 30-year mortgage rate has hit a 22-year high.""\n\nThis is Mostly True. Numerically, Trump is on target. However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage peaked at 7.79% on Oct. 26, 2023. That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.\n\nMortgage rates have spiked because the Federal Reserve in March 2022 began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Fed interest rate hikes are considered the most effective economic tools for curbing inflation, because they tend to cool the economy, which eases demand and lowers prices.\n\nSince the Fed hikes began, inflation has receded by about two-thirds. But a side effect has been that other types of interest rates — including mortgages — have also risen.\n\nSince the mortgage rate peak in October, the average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has fallen, hitting 6.67% on Dec. 21. Not counting the peak in recent months, that’s still higher than any rate going back to Aug. 2, 2007, when the rate was 6.68%.\n\nEconomists generally agree that some of Biden’s policies likely added to the pressures that pushed up prices.\n\nBiden’s coronavirus relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, put stimulus money into Americans’ hands when supply chains couldn’t produce enough goods to fulfill consumer demand. This worsened the rise of prices, which started because of pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions.\n\nHowever, ""the drivers of this inflation go back to COVID-19 — issues like supply-chain constraints, workforce shortages, and other factors,"" John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, told PolitiFact West Virginia in October. ""That is much larger than any particular Biden policy.""\n\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said Biden should ""assume some responsibility, but so should members of Congress who voted in favor of stimulus payments, tax cuts, generous unemployment benefits, aid to states and private businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic recession.""\n\nThe American Rescue Plan got no Republican support in Congress, but earlier pandemic relief bills Trump signed were passed with bipartisan support.\n\n""The average monthly mortgage payment: Under Trump, $1,746; Under Biden: $3,322.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThese are the figures for average monthly payments on a new home, real estate company CBRE reports. That’s a significant out-of-pocket increase for someone buying a new home, but it doesn’t affect homeowners who aren’t looking to move.\n\nThe figure is calculated for the purchase of a new home valued at the U.S. median of $430,000, with a 10% down payment.\n\nThe majority of American mortgage holders have fixed-rate mortgages that were locked in at much lower rates. In 2022, about 85% of mortgages had fixed rates.\n\nGiven the current high rates, adjustable-rate mortgages are gaining popularity. If mortgage rates decrease in 2024, homeowners who hold adjustable-rate mortgages should see their payments drop.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/large-crowd-gathers-pennsylvania-rally-172324539.html', 'Headline': 'Large Crowd Gathers at Pennsylvania Rally as Trump Blasts Biden', 'Snippet': 'Large crowds of people gathered in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, September 3, as former president Donald Trump hosted a rally in the area.The event also featured speeches from Doug Mastriano, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Republican Party candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene, and several other speakers.This footage, captured by Mark Henley, shows crowds outside the Mohegan Sun Arena and Trump later ...', 'Full_text': 'Large crowds of people gathered in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, September 3, as former president Donald Trump hosted a rally in the area.\n\nThe event also featured speeches from Doug Mastriano, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Republican Party candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene, and several other speakers.\n\nThis footage, captured by Mark Henley, shows crowds outside the Mohegan Sun Arena and Trump later speaking inside the stadium.\n\nLocal news reported that the venue reached maximum capacity, and additional supporters gathered outside the arena.

Spurred on by then-President Trump, rioters had traveled from far and wide to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHundreds involved in the siege have been arrested, but many remain at large as officials piece together what happened on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHere are some notable facts about the insurrection and its fallout:\n\nMinutes Trump spoke before the siege: About 70\n\nThe day began with a rally to bolster Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential race was stolen from him. Before Congress certified election results, thousands of Trump supporters gathered on the National Mall, just south of the White House, and listened for hours as some of Trump’s most prominent defenders, including his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, promoted the falsehood.\n\nTrump addressed the crowd for one hour and 11 minutes and said he would “never concede” the race, and that if his supporters didn’t “fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nRally attendance: Thousands\n\nRally organizers told the National Park Service that they anticipated 30,000 people would attend. Law enforcement said the crowd size ahead of the protest was possibly as much as 80,000, according to then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. The crowd size at the rally was at least 10,000, according to the Associated Press.\n\nPeople surrounding the Capitol before the breach: Several thousand\n\nA lot of attendees are believed to have peeled off as the siege turned violent. Experts say it\'s challenging to accurately estimate the crowd size because of the absence of aerial imagery, but they put a broad crowd size estimate at ""several thousand.""\n\nCapitol Police officers on duty: More than 1,200\n\nMore than 1,200 Capitol Police officers were working on U.S. Capitol grounds at the time of the attack. The Capitol Police has not said exactly how many officers were guarding the Capitol building itself.\n\nThe time it took for reinforcements to arrive: 15 minutes (but it\'s complicated)\n\nThe Capitol complex was breached on Jan. 6 about 1:50 p.m. Though some District of Columbia police officers responded within 15 minutes, the Pentagon took more than three hours to send National Guard troops to aide Capitol Police, according to Maj. Gen. William J. Walker. But a watchdog report is critical of this timeline.\n\nDeaths from the insurrection: 5 (or more)\n\nMost news sources have officially counted five deaths including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died after suffering two strokes, and San Diego resident Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by Capitol Police while climbing a barricaded door inside the Capitol. But some in Congress — including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) — have suggested the number of deaths is closer to nine and should include officers who committed suicide in the days and months following the attack.\n\nOfficers injured: More than 140\n\nMore than 140 law enforcement officers were physically harmed during the insurrection, according to a special congressional committee investigating the attack. In a July hearing, a District of Columbia police officer recounted a chaotic and violent day where he was tased in the head several times by rioters and beaten unconscious.\n\nPeople arrested: More than 700\n\nMore than 700 people have been arrested in connection with the insurrection, but the investigation is ongoing. More than 30 of those arrests were in California. The FBI is still seeking the public’s help to identify rioters.\n\nHours the certification of electors was delayed: More than 13\n\nThe Capitol was breached about 1:50 p.m. The Senate called a recess about 2:11 p.m. The Capitol was declared secure at 8 p.m.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) brought the House back into session at 9 p.m., and Vice President Mike Pence officially declared Joe Biden president-elect at 3:42 a.m. the next day.\n\nCost of cleanup and repairs: $1.5 million to more than $30 million\n\nTotal damages have been estimated to cost anywhere from $1.5 million to more than $30 million and include repairs and security measures like fencing.\n\nRioters left behind feces, blood, bullet holes, graffiti and bear repellent. Curators have requested $25,000 to restore historic artwork, including the bust of a U.S. politician accused of inciting another violent attack in the Capitol in 1954 — an armed group of four demanding Puerto Rico’s independence.\n\nPeople subpoenaed by Congress: 50-plus\n\nCongress has issued 51 subpoenas and counting in its investigation into the siege. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Trump advisor Stephen K. Bannon are among those subpoenaed. Members of far-right extremist groups like the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have also been drawn into the investigation for their roles in planning and orchestrating the riot.\n\nJan. 6-related lawsuits involving Trump: At least 5\n\nThe insurrection has spawned more than five lawsuits, all involving Trump. A group of House Democrats, some Capitol Police officers and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Dublin) filed separate lawsuits against Trump for his role in inciting the mob to overtake the Capitol.\n\nTrump has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review his lawsuit to block the release of White House records relating to the attack. His former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, is also suing to not release documents.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/politics/trump-crowd-size-obsession/index.html', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump’s crowd size obsession explains his entire presidency - CNN', 'Snippet': '1) Donald Trump’s presidency began on January 20, 2017, with a contentious debate between his press operation and the reporters who cover the White House over how large a crowd had attended his ...', 'Full_text': 'Consider this:\n\n1) Donald Trump’s presidency began on January 20, 2017, with a contentious debate between his press operation and the reporters who cover the White House over how large a crowd had attended his inauguration. Trump forced then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer to go in front of reporters and assert it had been “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.”\n\n2) As we learned Tuesday, Donald Trump’s presidency effectively ended on January 6, 2021, with the the billionaire businessman fighting with aides to let armed people through the magnetometers so that the crowd would look as full as possible in photographs taken of his address to the “Stop the Steal” rally. “He was very concerned about the shot, the photograph we would get,” testified Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, to the 1/6 committee on Tuesday.\n\nThose two episodes function as symbolic bookends of the Trump presidency. In a White House in which almost nothing was stable or predictable, the then-President’s utter obsession with not just drawing large crowds but also with ensuring that everyone knew he drew large crowds is a rare through line connecting the early days of the Trump White House to his final ones.\n\nThe examples are legion of Trump’s maniacal focus on proving to everyone just how many people had come to see him speak.\n\nRecently, in a speech to a social conservative group, Trump compared the crowd he had drawn for a July Fourth speech to the one who came to see Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I have a dream” address.\n\nSaid Trump:\n\n“And Dr. King gave a speech and it was great. … They showed the picture and it was massive. … They said it was a million people. … Then I gave my speech and they showed the same thing. … Everything was identical. … I gave my speech. So his, they said 1 million people. My pictures were exactly the same, but the people were slightly closer together. They were more compact. … There were more people, they were tighter together if you look at it. … Dr. Martin Luther King had a million, and that’s fine. Donald Trump with more people, had 25,000.”\n\nIn the wake of a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, in 2019, Trump traveled to the region to console the victims’ families. In a speech he gave from El Paso, he reminisced about another address he had given in the city a few months before.\n\nAs CNN reported at the time:\n\n“I was here three months ago,” Trump is seen telling a group of what appear to be first responders and other officials at University Medical Center in the video.\n\n“That place was packed. … That was some crowd. And we had twice the number outside. And then you had this crazy Beto. Beto had like 400 people in a parking lot, they said his crowd was wonderful.”\n\nDuring an attempt to return to the campaign trail amid the Covid-19 pandemic in the summer of 2020, Trump was irate at the smaller-than-expected turnout for a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The disappointing turnout led to the removal of Brad Parscale as his campaign manager.\n\nThere are more examples – so, so many more – but you get the idea: Trump has been fixated on his crowd sizes at every moment of his presidential campaign, his presidency and, now, his post-presidency.\n\nWhich raises a simple question: Why? As in, why does Trump care so much about crowds?\n\nI’m no psychology major – I am, in fact, an English major – but the cause seems relatively straightforward.\n\nTrump has spent a lifetime telling himself a story. And that story has a hero. And that hero is him. In Trump’s version of his life, he is the smartest, funniest, best-looking, most popular person on the planet.\n\nAnything that threatens that delicately built self-image is, therefore, a major threat. Empty seats in an arena represent visual evidence that Trump may not, ultimately, be as great as he thinks he is. So he reacts viscerally to them.'}}",97.5,2

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January. McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt.""'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/23/1145209559/jan-6-committee-final-report', 'Headline': 'The full January 6 report is out.

And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/01/us/trump-indictment-jan-6', 'Headline': 'Trump Indictment Jan. 6 Riot Was ‘Fueled by Lies’ From Trump, Special ...', 'Snippet': 'Trump Indictment Jan. 6 Riot Was ... journalists and the extensive investigation done by the Jan. 6 committee of the House. ... public comments on what happened, Mr. Trump described the day in ...', 'Full_text': '“Each of these conspiracies — which built on the widespread mistrust the defendant was creating through pervasive and destabilizing lies about election fraud — targeted a bedrock function of the United States federal government: the nation’s process of collecting, counting and certifying the results of the presidential election,” the indictment said.\n\nThe charges signify an extraordinary moment in United States history: a former president, in the midst of a campaign to return to the White House, being charged over attempts to use the levers of government power to subvert democracy and remain in office against the will of voters.\n\nIn sweeping terms, the indictment described how Mr. Trump and six co-conspirators employed a variety of means to reverse his defeat in the election almost from the moment that voting ended.\n\nIt depicted how Mr. Trump promoted false claims of fraud, sought to bend the Justice Department toward supporting those claims and oversaw a scheme to create false slates of electors pledged to him in states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. And it described how he ultimately pressured his vice president, Mike Pence, to use the fake electors to subvert the certification of the election at a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, that was cut short by the violence at the Capitol.\n\nThe indictment did not name the alleged co-conspirators, but the descriptions of their behavior match publicly known episodes involving prominent people around Mr. Trump.\n\nThe behavior of “Co-conspirator 1” appears to align with that of Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer whom he put in charge of efforts to deny the transfer of power after his main campaign lawyers made clear it was over. Mr. Giuliani’s lawyer, Robert J. Costello, acknowledged in a statement that it “appears that Mayor Giuliani is alleged to be co-conspirator No. 1.”\n\nThe description of “Co-conspirator 2” tracks closely with that of John Eastman, a California law professor who served as the architect of the plan to pressure Mr. Pence.\n\nThe co-conspirators could be charged at any point, and their inclusion in the indictment — even unnamed — places pressure on them to cooperate with investigators.\n\nMany of the details in the charges were familiar, having appeared either in news accounts or in the work of the House select committee investigating Jan. 6. There were descriptions of Mr. Trump’s attempt to install a loyalist, Jeffrey Clark, who appears to be a co-conspirator in the case, atop the Justice Department and to strong-arm the secretary of state of Georgia into finding him enough votes to win the election in that state.\n\nThere were also references to Mr. Trump posting a message on Twitter in mid-December 2020 calling for a “wild” protest in Washington on Jan. 6, and to him pressuring Mr. Pence to try to throw the election his way during the joint session of Congress that day.\n\nBut the indictment also contained some snippets of new information, such as a description of Mr. Trump telling Mr. Pence, “You’re too honest,” as the vice president pushed back on Mr. Trump’s pressure to interfere in the certification of Mr. Biden’s victory.\n\nIt also included an account of Mr. Trump telling someone who asked if he wanted additional pressure put on Mr. Pence that “no one” else but him needed to speak with the vice president.\n\nMr. Smith, in drafting his charging document, walked a cautious path in connecting Mr. Trump to the mob attack on the Capitol. The indictment mentioned Mr. Trump’s “exploitation of the violence and chaos” at the building that day, but did not accuse him of inciting the riot.\n\nIt also laid out how Mr. Trump was repeatedly told by multiple people, including top officials in his campaign and at the Justice Department, that he had lost the election and that his claims that he had been cheated were false. That sort of evidence could help prosecutors prove their accusations by establishing Mr. Trump’s intent.\n\nMr. Trump’s constant claims of widespread election fraud “were false, and the defendant knew they were false,” the indictment said, adding that he was told repeatedly that his assertions were untrue.\n\n“Despite having lost, the defendant was determined to remain in power,” the indictment said.\n\nMr. Trump has been summoned for his initial court appearance in the case on Thursday afternoon before a magistrate judge in Federal District Court in Washington, the special counsel’s office said. Ultimately, a trial date and a schedule for pretrial motions will be set, proceedings that are likely to extend well into the presidential campaign.\n\nMr. Trump’s lead lawyer on the case, John Lauro, laid out what appeared to be the beginning of his defense, telling Fox News, “I would like them to try to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Donald Trump believed that these allegations” about voter fraud “were false.”\n\nThe charges in the case came more than two and a half years after a pro-Trump mob — egged on by incendiary speeches by Mr. Trump and his allies — stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in the worst attack on the seat of Congress since the War of 1812.\n\nThey also came a little more than seven months after Attorney General Merrick B. Garland appointed Mr. Smith, a career federal prosecutor, to oversee both the election tampering and classified documents inquiries into Mr. Trump. They followed a series of high-profile hearings last year by the House Jan. 6 committee, which laid out extensive evidence of Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse the election results.\n\nMr. Garland moved to name Mr. Smith as special counsel in November, just days after Mr. Trump declared that he was running for president again.\n\nIn a brief appearance before reporters, Mr. Smith set out what he said was the former president’s moral, as well as legal, responsibility for violence at the Capitol, saying the riot was “fueled by lies” — Mr. Trump’s lies.\n\nMr. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, has incorporated attacking the investigations into his campaign messaging and fund-raising. His advisers have been blunt in private conversations that they see his winning the election as crucial to undoing the charges against him.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Trump denounced the indictment.\n\n“Why did they wait two and a half years to bring these fake charges, right in the middle of President Trump’s winning campaign for 2024?” he said, calling it “election interference” and comparing the Biden administration to Nazi Germany.\n\nThe judge assigned to Mr. Trump’s case, Tanya S. Chutkan, has been a tough jurist in cases against Jan. 6 rioters — and in a case that involved Mr. Trump directly. Appointed by President Barack Obama, she has routinely issued harsh penalties against people who stormed the Capitol.\n\nShe also denied Mr. Trump’s attempt to avoid disclosing documents to the Jan. 6 committee, ordering him to turn over the material and writing, “Presidents are not kings.”\n\nMr. Trump now faces two separate federal indictments. In June, Mr. Smith brought charges in Florida accusing Mr. Trump of illegally holding on to a highly sensitive trove of national defense documents and then obstructing the government’s attempts to get them back.\n\nThe scheme charged by Mr. Smith on Tuesday in the election case played out largely in the two months between Election Day in 2020 and the attack on the Capitol. During that period, Mr. Trump took part in a range of efforts to retain power despite having lost the presidential race.\n\nIn addition to federal charges in the election and documents cases, Mr. Trump also faces legal troubles in state courts.\n\nHe has been charged by the Manhattan district attorney’s office in a case that centers on hush money payments made to the porn actress Stormy Daniels in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\nThe efforts by Mr. Trump and his allies to reverse his election loss are also the focus of a separate investigation by the district attorney in Fulton County, Ga. That inquiry appears likely to generate charges this month.\n\nIt seems likely that Mr. Trump will face the prospect of at least three criminal trials next year, even as he is campaigning for the presidency. The Manhattan trial is scheduled to begin in March, while the federal documents case in Florida is set to go to trial in May.\n\nGlenn Thrush contributed reporting.\n\nThe indictment of the former president for trying to subvert democracy — an episode that has no precedent in American history — was issued by a federal grand jury in Washington and unsealed shortly before Mr. Smith gave his statement.\n\nMr. Trump has been charged with four crimes, including conspiracies to defraud the United States and to obstruct an official proceeding.\n\nHere are four takeaways:\n\nThe indictment portrays an attack on American democracy.\n\nMr. Smith framed his case against Mr. Trump as one that cuts to a core function of democracy: the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBy underscoring this theme, which he also laid out in the indictment, Mr. Smith cast his effort as not just an effort to hold Mr. Trump accountable but also to defend the very core of democracy.\n\nMr. Smith said the former president’s efforts to overturn the election went well beyond his First Amendment right to make claims about voter fraud. The indictment details Mr. Trump’s efforts to use the machinery of government — including his own Justice Department — to help him cling to power.\n\nTrump was placed at the center of the conspiracy.\n\nMr. Smith puts Mr. Trump at the heart of three overlapping conspiracies.\n\nThese conspiracies culminated on Jan. 6, 2021, as an attempt to obstruct Congress’s role in ratifying the Electoral College outcome.\n\nMr. Smith argued in the indictment that Mr. Trump knew his claims about a stolen election were false. He cited a litany of episodes in which campaign advisers, White House officials, top Justice Department lawyers, speakers of statehouses and election administrators all told Mr. Trump his claims about “outcome-determinative fraud” in the election were false. Mr. Trump nonetheless kept repeating them.\n\nEstablishing that Mr. Trump knew he was lying could be important to convincing a jury to convict him. A lawyer for Mr. Trump has already signaled that his defense could rest in part on showing that he truly believed he had been cheated out of re-election.\n\nTrump didn’t do it alone.\n\nThe indictment lists six co-conspirators, without naming or indicting them.\n\nBased on the descriptions provided of the co-conspirators, they match the profiles of a crew of outside lawyers and advisers that Mr. Trump turned to after his campaign and White House lawyers failed to turn up credible evidence of fraud and had lost dozens of cases to challenge the election results in swing states.\n\nAfter many of his core advisers told him his claims of fraud weren’t bearing out, Mr. Trump turned to lawyers who were willing to argue ever more outlandish conspiracy and legal theories to keep him in power.\n\nThese advisers included Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York; the constitutional lawyer John Eastman, who came up with the scheme to pressure Mr. Pence to block the certification of election results on Jan. 6; and Sidney Powell, the lawyer who pushed the theory that foreign nations had hacked into voting machines. Even Mr. Trump told advisers at the time that Ms. Powell’s theories sounded “crazy,” but he kept repeating them in public.\n\nIt’s unclear whether any or all of these co-conspirators will be indicted or whether they now have a period in which there’s an opportunity for them to decide to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nIndictments have only strengthened Trump’s hold on the Republican Party.\n\nMr. Trump may be on trial next year in three or four separate criminal cases — and there’s no telling what effect that might have on his general election prospects if he’s the Republican nominee. So far, the indictments appear to have had nothing but political upside for the former president.\n\nThe criminal investigations have helped consolidate Mr. Trump’s position as his party’s overwhelming front-runner in the presidential primaries.\n\nThe latest charges were Mr. Trump’s third indictment since early April. In the four months since his first indictment in New York, Mr. Trump has gained nearly 10 percentage points, according to national polling averages. During that same period, his closest rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, has seen his support drop to the point where he now lags Mr. Trump nationally by more than 30 percentage points and is far behind in all the early voting states.\n\nTo understand the depths of frustration that Mr. Trump’s presidential rivals are wallowing in as they helplessly watch a Republican electorate in thrall to the former president, consider a single data point from this week’s New York Times/Siena College poll.\n\n“In a head-to-head contest with Mr. DeSantis,” The Times wrote, “Mr. Trump still received 22 percent among voters who believe he has committed serious federal crimes — a greater share than the 17 percent that Mr. DeSantis earned from the entire G.O.P. electorate.”\n\nIf Mr. Trump does well among Republican voters who already think he’s a criminal, what hope do his G.O.P. opponents have of exploiting this latest indictment?\n\nIn New York, he is accused of falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment while the special counsel, Jack Smith, also previously accused Mr. Trump of mishandling national security secrets.\n\nWere a federal case to still be pending on Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump could simply use his power as president to force the Justice Department to drop the matter, as he has suggested he might do.\n\n(It is not yet clear when a trial over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election will start. The classified documents case, which will be tried in Florida, has a date set for May, but that could change depending on how pretrial arguments unfold.)\n\nBut the Constitution does not give presidents supervisory authority over state prosecutors, so that would not work for the state inquiries in New York and Georgia, where the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, has indicated she is nearing a decision on charges in her own election-interference investigation.\n\nThe most Mr. Trump could probably do is try to delay a trial over any state charges that may be pending. In the past, the Justice Department has taken the position that criminal legal proceedings against a president while he is in office would be unconstitutional because it would interfere with his ability to perform his duties.\n\nThere is no definitive Supreme Court ruling on the matter because the issue has never arisen before. In 1997, the Supreme Court allowed a federal lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed while he was in office — but that was a civil case, not a criminal one.\n\nMr. Trump’s trial in New York on charges of bookkeeping fraud is scheduled to begin in March. The timing of any trial in Georgia is an open question.\n\nIf Mr. Trump were to be convicted in one or more cases, he is almost certain to pursue appeals, delaying any sentencing and all but ensuring he is not incarcerated by Inauguration Day. The question would then arise of what would happen if he took office for a second term.\n\nShould Mr. Trump be convicted in a federal case, he would likely then move to pardon himself, a power he claimed in 2018 that he had the “absolute right” to wield. It is not clear whether a self-pardon would be legitimate.\n\nNo text in the Constitution bars a president from doing so. But in 1974, the Justice Department issued a terse legal opinion stating that President Richard Nixon did not appear to have the authority to pardon himself “under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.”\n\nBut the opinion did not explain what transformed that principle into an unwritten limit on the power the Constitution bestows on presidents. Legal experts have disagreed on that question, but no president has ever claimed he was pardoning himself, so it has never been tested in court.\n\nIn such a scenario, Mr. Trump is almost certain to use his control of the Justice Department to ensure that it sides with him on whether a self-pardon is legitimate. If prosecutors do not challenge a self-pardon, it is not clear who else would have legal standing to pursue the matter.\n\nShould Mr. Trump be convicted in New York or Georgia, he could not pardon himself because the Constitution does not empower a president to forgive state offenses. That is instead a power wielded by governors. If the relevant governor did not pardon him, he could seek a federal court order delaying any incarceration — or requiring his release from prison — while he is the sitting president, on constitutional grounds.\n\nYet another possibility is that if he is incarcerated, upon the start of his second term, he could be removed from office under the 25th Amendment as “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”\n\nBut that outcome would require the majority of a president’s cabinet, along with the vice president, to make such a determination. Among the questions that possibility would raise is who would qualify as a cabinet member if the Senate has not confirmed any new political appointees by Mr. Trump.\n\n“These un-American witch hunts will fail and President Trump will be re-elected to the White House so he can save our country from the abuse, incompetence and corruption that is running through the veins of our country at levels never seen before,” the Trump campaign said in the statement.\n\nThe line of attack by Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner for president, was a familiar one. It dates back to at least 2017, when he began alluding to a “deep state” plot by the Justice Department.\n\nBack then, he was fixated on Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server to store classified material and questioned why his opponent in the 2016 election had not been criminally charged.\n\n“Why aren’t our deep State authorities looking at this?” Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Twitter in November 2017, tagging Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. “Rigged & corrupt?”\n\nThe term “deep state” had appeared to be a riff on remarks that Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, made just after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Mr. Bannon, at a conservative gathering, said that the “deconstruction of the administrative state” was underway.\n\nBut as Mr. Trump’s own grip on power became threatened — by his first impeachment in 2019 and a two-year investigation into Russian election meddling — he broadened the narrative. His campaign speeches became peppered with accusations that career civil servants had conspired to undermine his presidency. His rhetoric became more vitriolic, calling those officials “absolute scum” and comparing them to Nazis. His campaign invoked “Nazi Germany” again on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Trump was so consumed with conspiracy theories about the “deep state” that his administration weeded out Cabinet members and career civil servants it deemed to be disloyal at prolific rates. Scores left under their own volition.\n\nBy one account, the Trump administration had lost nearly 1,200 senior career service employees in its first 18 months — roughly 40 percent more than during President Barack Obama’s first 18 months in office.\n\nHe relied on the narrative again when he was impeached a second time after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAnd now, with criminal indictments against him piling up as he seeks to return to the White House, he has further demonized the federal government. He has characterized each successive indictment as examples of the Justice Department being weaponized against him, pivoting from the broader “deep state” conspiracy to one aimed squarely at the Democrats now in power.\n\nHis Republican rivals have largely echoed his narrative. “As President, I will end the weaponization of government,” Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Mr. Trump’s top 2024 rival, said on Twitter moments after the third indictment was announced on Tuesday.\n\nAnd his allies in Congress and conservative media have always been quick to adopt his talking points. At times, they also cast themselves as victims of the “deep state.”\n\nAn example: In 2018, Representative Jim Jordan, the House Freedom Caucus firebrand, blamed liberal bureaucrats in the government amid criticism that he had failed to report sexual misconduct at Ohio State University while he was a wrestling coach there.\n\nMr. Jordan is now chairman of a House subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government, which Republicans created this year.\n\nThough none have gone as far as him, Mr. Trump is not the first politician who has sought to discredit the Justice Department, which includes the F.B.I., often as the walls of justice closed in on them.\n\nAs his presidency began to unravel in 1974, Richard M. Nixon warned the Justice Department to back off its investigation into Watergate, when a White House “plumbers” unit broke into the Democratic National Committee’s offices in Washington, D.C. He resigned about four months later.\n\nRepublicans cried foul when, four days before the 1992 presidential election, a special prosecutor brought an additional one-count indictment against Caspar W. Weinberger, the former defense secretary, accusing him of lying to Congress about the Iran-contra Affair. President George H.W. Bush’s G.O.P. allies blamed the timing of the indictment for his defeat by the Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. Mr. Bush had been vice president in the Reagan administration during the scandal.\n\nDemocrats and President Bill Clinton’s lawyer relentlessly attacked the impartiality of Ken Starr, the independent counsel who led the investigation into the president’s affair with Monica Lewinsky, during impeachment proceedings in 1998. They accused him of “overkill” and claimed he was leaking information to the news media. At the request of the Justice Department, his oversight role had been expanded from beyond his initial inquiry into the Whitewater deal. Mr. Clinton was impeached mostly along party lines in the House, but acquitted by the Senate.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/07/22/1112323797/jan-6-hearing-recap-187-minutes', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 panel details what Trump did — and did not do - NPR', 'Snippet': ""Here's every word from the 8th Jan. 6 committee on its investigation. ... earlier that day and did not comment on the violence. ...

Elaine Luria, D-Va., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., used witness testimony to piece together Trump\'s actions the afternoon of Jan. 6, as there was not an official call log from the White House that afternoon and nothing included in the presidential daily diary.\n\n""The chief White House photographer wanted to take pictures because it was, in her words, \'very important for his archives and for history.\' But she was told: \'no photographs\',"" Luria said.\n\nWhite House counsel and White House officials testified that Trump did not make any calls to the secretary of defense, the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security during the siege.\n\nAlthough the White House call logs are empty, Trump lawyer and ally Rudy Giuliani\'s call logs show at least two calls between him and the president that day. The committee also noted that other Trump calls that day are known, including several to Republican senators to urge them to delay the certification of Biden\'s win.\n\n\'I\'ve seen the impact that his words have on his supporters\'\n\nA major theme from the hearing was how much television the former president consumed as the chaos and violence unfolded.\n\n""President Trump sat in his dining room and watched the attack on television while his senior-most staff closest advisers and family members begged him to do what is expected of any American president,"" Luria said. ""When lives and our democracy hung in the balance, President Trump refused to act because of his selfish desire to stay in power.""\n\nThe committee played video clips of news coverage from Fox News, to show what Trump watched in real time as he tuned in from his dining room, just off from the Oval Office. He watched as his supporters, donning red caps and chanting his name, overwhelmed and outnumbered police as they flooded the Capitol grounds and attempted to breach the Capitol.\n\nAt 1:49 p.m. ET, just as D.C. police were declaring a riot at the Capitol, Trump tweeted out a video of his speech at the Ellipse earlier that day and did not comment on the violence.\n\nKizinger noted that between 1:49 and 2:24, when Trump posted a subsequent tweet, ""staff repeatedly came into the room to see him and plead that he make a strong public statement condemning the violence and instructing the mob to leave the Capitol.""\n\nThe panel shared video testimony from top advisers and his children imploring Trump to call off the attack.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, a former White House staffer, has previously testified to a conversation between White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\n""I remember [Cipollone] saying something to the effect of, \'Mark we need to do something more.

""They truly latch on to every word and every tweet that he says, and so I think that in that moment for him to tweet out the message about Mike Pence, it was him pouring gasoline on the fire,"" she said.\n\nMatthews said White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her ""in a hushed tone"" that Trump ""did not want to include any sort of mention of peace in that tweet.""\n\nShe said McEnany told her ""it took some convincing on their part those who were in the room and she said that there was a back and forth going over different phrases to find something that he was comfortable with, and it wasn\'t until Ivanka Trump suggested the phrase \'stay peaceful\', that he finally agreed to include it.""\n\nPottinger said he was ""disturbed"" by Trump\'s tweet attacking Pence and that it was ""the opposite of what we really needed in that moment which was a de-escalation.""\n\nThe panel described one of Trump\'s final interactions on Jan. 6, as he departed the White House dining room at 6:27 p.m. ET to go to the residence.\n\n""As he was gathering his things in the dining room to leave, President Trump reflected on the day\'s events with an unnamed White House employee,"" Kinzinger said, adding the employee recalled Trump saying: ""Mike Pence let me down.""\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIn his closing statement, Kinzinger said Trump abandoned his responsibilities as commander-in-chief on Jan. 6.\n\n""Whatever your politics, whatever you think about the outcome of the election, we as Americans must all agree on this: Donald Trump\'s conduct on Jan. 6 was a supreme violation of his oath of office and a complete dereliction of his duty to our nation,"" he said.

On Monday, the committee didn’t equivocate.\n\nThe committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary, released after the meeting, it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nIn practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nBut the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department’s court.\n\nAll roads lead to Trump\n\nCommittee members repeatedly pointed to Trump’s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6.\n\nMonday’s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break “the foundation of American democracy.” Members stressed that Trump knew the election was not stolen but continued to push baseless claims about widespread voter fraud in an effort to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory.\n\nVisually reinforcing their argument\n\nThe committee relied once again on video — an effective and memorable tool the panel has used throughout its hearings with closed-door witness testimony and harrowing scenes from the violent attack on the Capitol, to make an its case against Trump.\n\nThe montage went step-by-step through Trump’s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters.\n\nA bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor\n\nThough GOP lawmakers have called the committee partisan, the panel is, in fact, bipartisan.\n\nTwo Republicans who volunteered to join the committee: Rep. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. They both brought GOP staff members along with them who worked for the committee.\n\nTo be sure, Cheney and Kinzinger are outliers in their caucus because they are anti-Trump. And that is the core of Trump’s critiques of the committee — that it stacked with Trump haters. Still, even if they oppose Trump, Cheney and Kinzinger are still deeply conservative Republicans.\n\nNo matter what Trump and his allies say, Democrats will forever be able to accurately assert that the panel’s findings, conclusions, its final report and its criminal referrals are bipartisan.\n\nRead more takeaways here\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee had its last public meeting today. Here\'s what happens next.\n\nThe end is near — at least for the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nThe panel held its final public session Monday where it voted on its final report and approved a criminal referral for several charges against former President Donald Trump.\n\nSo here’s what happens next: Committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the full report will come out Wednesday. This will be a historical document that will be studied for generations — never before has a sitting president tried to steal a second term.\n\nAdditional “transcripts and documents” will be released before the end of the year, Thompson said.\n\nThe sheer volume of this material can’t be overstated. The panel interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, likely generating tens of thousands of pages of transcripts. Many of these interviews were filmed, which means the panel has hundreds of hours of footage that it might release very soon.\n\nThese upcoming releases will provide fodder to Trump’s critics. But it will also grant a key demand from some of Trump’s allies — that the panel disclose the full context of its interviews. Up until this point, the panel has been very selective about which snippets of witness interviews got played at public hearings.\n\nThe current Congress ends on January 3, 2023, and that’s when the committee will cease to exist. But the Justice Department investigation, overseen by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by US Attorney General Merrick Garland, continues.\n\nOf the committee’s nine members, four won’t be returning to Congress. Besides Republican vice-chair Rep. Liz Cheney and Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida is retiring, and Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia was one of the handful of House Democratic incumbents who lost their seats in the 2022 midterms last month.\n\n""We ended up in the middle"": Rep. Jamie Raskin explains how the committee made criminal referral selections\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who serves on the subcommittee of the Jan. 6 select committee responsible for presenting criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, laid out how panel members arrived at the decisions presented during Monday’s final public session.\n\nAsked about process offenses, such as witness tampering or perjury, Raskin said “as evidence is assembled about that, I hope that those will be charged as well. You cannot suborn perjury, you cannot obstruct justice, you cannot interfere with a congressional proceeding.” However, Raskin did not specify who these potential charges related to in the panel’s investigation.\n\nIn terms of unanswered questions left by the committee, Raskin was asked if the panel ever solved the situation with the pipe bombs on Jan. 6 and said, “I don’t believe there have been any updates since we first looked int to. Those are unsolved crimes.”\n\nIn pictures: Scenes from the last public Jan. 6 committee meeting\n\nCheck out photos from the last Jan. 6 hearings here.\n\nCommittee members Schiff and Raskin explain why more Trump associates were not referred to the DOJ\n\nJan. 6 committee members, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Adam Schiff, explained that more associates of former President Donald Trump were not directly referred to the Department of Justice because the committee wanted to focus on those with “abundant evidence” against them.\n\nRaskin noted that the DOJ will receive the full report and can decide if anyone else discussed merits further investigation.\n\n“We wanted to proceed in such a way that we could all feel certain that these were people where evidence exists that they engaged in criminal offenses against our country,” he added.\n\nSchiff said, “The long and the short of it is we possess evidence that up until this release, the Justice Department may not have, they possess evidence that we don’t have, and the cumulative impact of all that evidence will hopefully lead to justice for those that have broken the law here.”\n\nRaskin promised that they would cooperate with the Justice Department “quickly,” while Schiff added that the committee expects evidence will start to be made available to both the DOJ and the public starting Wednesday.\n\nAsked to explain why those four House Republicans were referred to House Ethics in particular, Schiff pointed out that these four failed to comply with a congressional subpoena, which is easier to prove.\n\nHere\'s a recap of what happened at the Jan. 6 committee\'s final public session\n\nAfter extensive investigation, the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol held its final public meeting Monday where they voted on their final report and approved a series of criminal referrals — including against former President Donald Trump and others in his orbit.\n\nThe final report is expected to be released publicly Wednesday.\n\nHere are the key things that happened at the committee’s last public session:\n\nTrump’s role in the events of Jan. 6: The committee announced it will refer several criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including obstructing an official proceeding, defrauding the United States, making false statements and assisting or aiding an insurrection.The DOJ special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into Jan. 6. The referrals are largely symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes.\n\nFinal report: Members voted to approve their final report, which will include a bulk of results from the 17-month investigation, chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said during his opening remarks. An executive summary of the report was released after Monday’s meeting, but the full report won’t be available to the public until Wednesday.\n\nA spanning investigation: During the meeting, the committee played a video summarizing its investigation. Since its formation in July 2021, the panel conducted more than 1,000 interviews as well as issued subpoenas and court battles to obtain hundreds of thousands of documents. The committee said the evidence shows that Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nClosing remarks from the committee: Though its investigation is coming to a close, Thompson reiterated the importance of preventing another insurrection from happening again, for the sake of American democracy. “I believe nearly two years later, this is still a time of reflection and reckoning,” he said. “If we are to survive as a nation of laws and democracy, this can never happen again.” Thompson said the most important thing in preventing another event like Jan. 6 is accountability. The committee’s vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, said Trump was “unfit for any office.”\n\nOfficers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 were sitting in the front row during committee meeting\n\nAs the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 riot held its last public meeting, the room was packed.\n\nLaw enforcement officers who testified at the panel’s first public hearing last July about the violence they experienced defending the US Capitol on Jan. 6 sat in the front row, as they have for every public event the committee has had.\n\nThose officers include: US Capitol Police (USCP) officer Harry Dunn, former Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, former USCP Sgt. Aquilino Gonell and Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges.\n\nFanone sat in the audience as the panel replayed his testimony about being attacked as the riot unfolded.\n\nA number of committee staff and investigators — and even former GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, who has publicly supported the panel’s work — were in the audience as well.\n\nThe meeting took place in the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caucus Room which was recently renamed to honor House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who stepping down as speaker at the end of the this Congress.\n\nIn previous hearings, it was typical to see a committee staffer sitting at the dais with the members. But for today’s meeting, it was just the nine committee members at the dais, each taking turns speaking.\n\nJan. 6 committee chair says he\'s ""convinced"" Trump will be charged by DOJ with help of panel\'s evidence\n\nJan. 6 committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the evidence that supports the panel’s decision to refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for several criminal charges is “clear,” adding that he is “convinced” that the DOJ will ultimately charge Trump.\n\n“The committee looked at it long and hard, and from my vantage point, we couldn’t do anything except make the referral,” Thompson told CNN after Monday’s meeting, acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the referral.\n\n“It was clear in the evaluation of the evidence uncovered by our committee that those actions taken by the president… former President Trump, clearly created a problem for this country,” he added.\n\nThe committee also voted to approve its final report which will be released to the public Wednesday. That report will contain most of the evidence from the 17-month long investigation — including full transcripts from more than 1,000 interviews.\n\n“We think it’s important for the Justice Department to look at that body of information that we put together,” he said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n1c447b21-7492-487d-bf20-bbd9f8559559.mp4\n\n01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nKellyanne Conway testified that Trump described rioters as ""upset"" the day after the attack\n\nTrump “minimized the seriousness of the attack” in the days following the riot, Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Elaine Luria said, specifically citing testimony that Trump’s former senior adviser Kellyanne Conway gave to the committee.\n\nAsked to describe her conversation with Trump the day after the riot, Conway, said she didn’t think it was very long. “I don’t think it was very long. I just said that was just a terrible day.”\n\nTrump, Conway said, responded to her saying, “These people are upset. They’re very upset.”\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump similarly described rioters as being “upset” during a heated phone call he had with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy while the insurrection was underway, claiming the rioters cared more about the election results than the California Republican did.\n\n“Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,” Trump said, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call afterward by McCarthy.\n\nTrump’s comment set off what GOP lawmakers familiar with the call described as a shouting match between the two men. A furious McCarthy told Trump the rioters were breaking into his office through the windows, and asked, “Who the f–k do you think you are talking to?” according to a Republican lawmaker familiar with the call.\n\nTrump was warned of violence before Jan. 6, but refused to encourage peaceful protest\n\nIn the lead up to Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Donald Trump ignored warnings from advisors about the potential for violence and rejected any suggestion that he should explicitly tell supporters to be peaceful, Rep. Stephanie Murphy said Monday.\n\nMurphy pointed to a text message exchange provided to the committee by Hope Hicks, Trump’s former communications director. In the exchange, Hicks and then White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley discussed getting Trump to tweet out a message to his supporters. Gidley texted Hicks that Trump “really should tweet something about Being NON-violent.”\n\nHicks responded that she had already “suggested it several times” without success.\n\n“Mr. Herschmann said that he had made the same recommendation directly to the President and that he had refused,” Hicks said in her interview with the committee, a video of which was played Monday.\n\nDespite his staff’s warnings, Murphy said, Trump took to the stage on Jan. 6, 2021, and encouraged his supporters to “fight like hell,” and sent them marching to the Capitol building.\n\nNOW: Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral against Trump and other officials\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral it plans to make against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department and other officials.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee would refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the committee, told CNN last week that a subcommittee of members would make recommendations to the full committee about various referrals.\n\nThe full committee is now expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nRemember: A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case. With the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nJan. 6 committee concerned lawyer took part in attempt to keep truth from them, Lofgren says\n\nHouse Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren revealed during Monday’s public meeting that an unnamed lawyer appeared to have attempted to shape the testimony of one witness in a way that could help Donald Trump.\n\nLofgren noted a lawyer suggested that the witness not share some memories during her testimony to the committee, that she couldn’t learn who was paying for her lawyer, and that Trump-allied entities offered to keep her under their wing as her testimony neared.\n\nAs it became clear what the witness would say, Lofgren added, the job offers evaporated.\n\nLofgren didn’t name the lawyer or the female witness, and it’s not clear if all of the examples are about one witness.\n\nIt’s not unusual or illegal for lawyers to take money from motivated backers to pay for witnesses to be represented. But lawyers must follow strict ethics guidelines, governed by their state bars and enforced by the courts. The House select committee previously shared their concerns about potential witness influence with the Justice Department.\n\nFormer Trump aide Hope Hicks describes conversation with Trump saying the only thing that matters is winning\n\nIn a new video clip played by the House Jan. 6 committee, Hope Hicks, who previously served as a top aide to former President Donald Trump, referenced the baseless claims of election fraud and said: “I was becoming increasingly concerned that … we were damaging his legacy.”\n\nTrump “said something along the lines of, you know, ‘Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,’” Hicks said in the clip.\n\nThe committee played the clip after Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren said Trump was repeatedly told there was no evidence to back up his false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, and the panel “has obtained testimony from new witnesses who have come forward to tell us about their conversations with ex-President Trump on this topic.”\n\n“Donald Trump knowingly and corruptly repeated election fraud lies, which incited his supporters to violence on Jan. 6. He continues to repeat his meritless claim that the election was stolen even today, and continues to erode our most cherished and shared belief in free and fair elections,” Lofgren later continued.\n\nKinzinger calls out fellow Republicans for their role in Trump’s DOJ schemes\n\nGOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the two Republicans on the the Jan. 6 committee, accused former president Donald Trump of trying to abuse the powers of the Justice Department so he could stay in office.\n\nKinzinger described how Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to publicly endorse his false claims about massive voter fraud. As part of the plan, Trump wanted them to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,” according to committee testimony.\n\nA retiring Republican, Kinzinger called out his fellow GOP lawmakers. He also specifically name-dropped Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, who was involved with some of Trump’s scheming at the Justice Department.\n\nWhen then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to go along with Trump’s plan, Trump almost fired him and replaced him with Jeffrey Clark, a Trump loyalist at DOJ who embraced his election lies.\n\n“It was only after the threat of mass resignations that President Trump rescinded his offer to Mr. Clark,” Kinzinger said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\ncc4283b8-e6ad-44ea-8cac-93d9dcbf8029.mp4\n\n04:42 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump ""oversaw"" legally dubious fake electors plot, Jan. 6 committee says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump “oversaw” an effort to obtain and transmit false Electoral College certificates, tying him directly to a core tenet of the broader plot to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory in key swing states, the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection said Monday.\n\nThe panel highlighted Trump’s personal involvement in the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost, arguing that the evidence shows he actively worked to “transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives.”\n\nThose certificates, which surfaced publicly earlier this year, helped spark criminal investigations into the Trump team’s attempt to subvert the Electoral College.\n\nAs part of its closing message Monday, the select committee emphasized that these “false ballots” were created despite concerns among Trump’s election lawyers and White House counsel that doing so may be “unlawful.”\n\n“In spite of these concerns, and the concerns of individuals in the White House Counsel’s Office, President Trump and others proceeded with this plan,” he added.\n\nThe committee has evidence that shows these “intentionally false” Electoral College certificates were “transmitted to multiple officers of the federal government,” according to Schiff.\n\nEvidence collected by the committee also shows these documents “were intended to interfere with the proper conduct of the joint session, where the existence of so-called ‘competing slates’ of electors would serve as a pretext for legitimate electoral votes to be rejected,” he added.\n\nCheney: Trump ""is unfit for any office""\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the committee, issued a scathing rebuke of former President Donald Trump during her opening remarks on Monday, saying he is unfit for office based on his actions regarding Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\n“At the beginning of our investigation, we understood that tens of millions of Americans had been persuaded by President Trump that the 2020 election was stolen by overwhelming fraud. And we also knew this was flatly false. We knew that dozens of state and federal judges had addressed and resolved all manner of allegations about the election,” Cheney said. “Our legal system functioned as it should. But our president would not accept the outcome. Among the most shameful of this committee’s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television.”\n\nShe went on to describe how Trump was unmoved by “urgent pleas” from people around him to “issue a public statement instructing his supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol,” even as rioters attacked law enforcement officials and halted the electoral count.\n\n“In addition to being unlawful as described in our report, this was an utter moral failure, and a clear dereliction of duty,” Cheney added.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney: ""At the heart of our Republic is the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power""\n\nGOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection on the US Capitol, said the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power is “at the heart of our Republic.”\n\nShe added: “Trumbull called this ‘one of the highest moral lessons ever given the world.’ With this noble act, George Washington established the indispensable example of the peace transfer of power in our nation.”\n\nShe traced this orderly transfer of power through every president of the United States until former President Donald Trump refused his constitutional duty.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nfb900dba-c57b-4545-9654-1fd8f5848d90.mp4\n\n05:07 - Source: CNN\n\nThompson: It\'s up to the people of America to decide who deserves the public\'s trust\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said that the future of democracy rests on the hands of the American public during his opening statement at Monday’s public meeting.\n\nHe also thanked the American public for tuning into the committee’s hearings and said that he hoped that the evidence presented lived up to their expectations.\n\n“I’m grateful to the millions of you who followed this committee’s work. I hope we lived up to our commitment to present the facts — and let the facts speak for themselves,” Thompson said.\n\nHe continued, “Let me say in closing, the women and men seated around me on this dais are public servants in the most genuine sense. They put aside politician and partisanship, to ensure the success of this committee, and providing answers to the American people.”\n\nThompson specifically thanked Republican Rep. Liz Cheney for her participation. “I especially want to thank and acknowledge our vice chair, who has become a true partner in this bipartisan effort, Ms. Cheney of Wyoming.”\n\nAmerica is still in a time of ""reflection and reckoning"" nearly 2 years after Jan. 6, chairman says\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said the panel’s findings show that former President Donald Trump was responsible for the insurrection at the US Capitol and that there is still “reckoning” left to do, nearly two years later.\n\n“We remain in strange and uncharted waters,” Thompson said, as the committee comes to the close.\n\nIn opening statements to the committee’s final public session, Thompson said Americans show faith in elected officials that they will abide by laws and uphold elected results.\n\n“If the faith is broken, so is our democracy,” he said. “Donald Trump broke that faith. He lost the 2020 election and knew it, but he chose to try to stay in office through a multi-part scheme to overturn the results and block the transfer of power.”\n\n“In the end, he summoned a mob to Washington,” he said, adding that their findings show Trump knew they were “armed and angry.”\n\nThompson said the committee intends to make the bulk of its results public in the form of its final report, expected to be released Wednesday.\n\nAlong with adopting its final report on Monday, the committee is also expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, CNN previously reported.\n\n“So, today, beyond our findings, we will also show that evidence we’ve gathered points to further action beyond the power of this committee, or the Congress, to help ensure accountability under law,” he added.\n\n“Accountability that can only be found in the criminal justice system. We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a roadmap to justice,” he said.\n\nThompson didn’t announce the criminal referrals in his opening statement but said that the panel has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nCNN’s Jeremy Herb contributed reporting to this post.\n\nNOW: The Jan. 6 committee has started its final public meeting\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has begun its final public meeting.\n\nThe panel is expected to announce criminal referrals to the Justice Department and Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, has said the panel will approve its final report at the meeting. It won’t be made public until Wednesday. Members of the committee have promised to release the report before the end of the year since Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nThe meeting — which, unlike previous gatherings of the committee, is not a hearing with witnesses — will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals, Thompson said last week.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies.\n\nThe committee has been investigating the events on and leading up to the insurrection since the panel was formed in July 2021.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee’s final public session is starting soon. Here are key things to watch for.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, will soon hold its last public meeting, marking the end of an expansive investigation that has spanned more than 17 months, encompassed more than 1,000 interviews and culminated in accusations that former President Donald Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nThrough blockbuster hearings, interviews with some of the former president’s closest allies and court battles to free up documents, the committee sought to tell the definitive narrative of what happened in the lead up to and on Jan. 6.\n\nOn Monday, members are expected to vote on its final report – spanning hundreds of pages and encapsulating its key findings, which will be released to the public on Wednesday – as well as present criminal referrals it plans to make to the Justice Department. This meeting will be the panel’s last message to the public, and members are seeking to end on a powerful note.\n\nThe charges the panel is considering asking DOJ to pursue include multiple against Trump, such as obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe recommendations match the allegations the House select committee made against Trump and his elections attorney John Eastman in a previous court proceeding seeking Eastman’s emails.\n\nThe final House report could include additional charges proposed for Trump, according to the source. It will provide justification from the committee investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nThe panel is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to Trump, CNN has reported: former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Eastman, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who leads the Jan. 6 subcommittee tasked with presenting recommendations on criminal referrals to the full panel, recently said that “the gravest offense in constitutional terms is the attempt to overthrow a presidential election and bypass the constitutional order. Subsidiary to all of that are a whole host of statutory offenses, which support the gravity and magnitude of that violent assault on America.”\n\nRaskin, along with Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, both of California, and the panel’s vice chair, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, comprised the subcommittee tasked with providing the full panel with referral recommendations that will be adopted on Monday.\n\nTrump\'s team braces for criminal referrals while he lashes out on social media, sources say\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s team huddled together multiple times since they learned the committee would be issuing criminal referrals — attempting to prepare for what they believed going to happen —a criminal referral from the House Select Committee to the Department of Justice.\n\nSources close to Trump said much of his inner circle were not ignoring the committee’s actions, despite many around the former president brushing it off as political.\n\nMany of his top advisers spent time on the phone with legal counsel, trying to get a deeper understanding of what exactly criminal referrals would mean and how to plan a response.\n\nWhile some aides said Trump was unbothered by the committee, the former president spent the weekend fixated on their actions.\n\nIn a flurry of social media posts on Truth Social, Trump called the committee names, accused them of “illegally leaking confidential info” and hitting individuals sitting on the committee.\n\nHe also posted copies of tweets from the afternoon on Jan. 6, calling for protestors to be “peaceful.” During the Jan. 6 hearings, former White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews testified that she was told Trump did not want to include any mention of “peace” in his tweets, but ultimately gave in to White House officials and advisers urged the former president to do more as the violent attack was unfolding.\n\nThe criminal referrals are just the latest in a long line of legal battles Trump is facing as he ramps up his third presidential campaign.\n\nToday\'s committee meeting is expected to have a ""simple and sober"" tone\n\nAs the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection lays out its evidence and criminal referrals today, lawmakers are expected to hit a sober tone, sources say.\n\nToday’s meeting is expected to be relatively brief with some multimedia presentations.\n\nUnlike previous hearings that relied on compelling witness testimony and splashy video montages, today’s event is designed to drive home the key evidence the committee uncovered and the gravity of what transpired in the run up and on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Nobody’s spiking the football here,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat and Jan. 6 committee member, told CNN just ahead of the committee meeting.\n\nJan. 6 committee treating release of executive summary and today\'s meeting as a roadmap for DOJ, sources say\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is treating today’s public meeting and the release of its executive summary as a “roadmap” for the Department of Justice, sources tell CNN.\n\nThe committee intends to lay out its body of evidence and drive home its conclusion that former President Donald Trump was culpable for the events that transpired on Jan. 6, 2021 — the basis for its plans to refer Trump to DOJ on at least three criminal charges.\n\nLawmakers are primarily focused on laying out their case for DOJ, but their wide-ranging investigation has uncovered information that congressional investigators believe could be relevant to various bodies — from state bars to the House ethics committee.\n\nCongressional investigators have already provided what they believe is evidence of criminal activity to an Atlanta-area district attorney leading a criminal investigation into Trump and his allies, according to someone familiar with the investigation.\n\nTrump legal team mired in disagreements as he faces criminal referral\n\nAs the Jan. 6 committee is expected to issue a criminal referral for former President Donald Trump, his legal team has continued to be bogged down in internal disagreements about the many probes facing him.\n\nTrump’s team has met to talk about what to expect from the committee today, but they are much more focused and concerned with the other investigations facing him, including the federal grand jury on Jan. 6, the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation and the special grand jury in Georgia, multiple people familiar with the workings of the team say.\n\nDespite the many probes facing Trump, his team is not acting as a unified front, but has often been locked in serious disagreement over how to proceed on several of the investigations, mainly when it comes to the documents one.\n\nOne thing Trump’s advisers will watch for today is how deep the referrals from the committee go and whether it mentions obstruction of the investigation when it pertains to Trump.\n\nTrump advisers and aides will be watching the meeting today closely, however sources close to Trump said the former President has told them he does not plan on watching.\n\nHowever, he will be updated by people around him, as he has been for all of the public hearings thus far.\n\nAs of now, Trump’s legal team will not be engaging in the response to the committee today, however sources stress that this could change as the public meeting unfolds.\n\nThese are the crimes the Jan. 6 committee is said to be considering for a Trump referral\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is eyeing multiple alleged crimes for a referral of former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, CNN reported last week.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the matter, they include:\n\nInsurrection\n\nObstruction of an official proceeding\n\nConspiracy to defraud the federal government\n\nFor the latter two, the lawmakers can rely on an opinion from a federal judge in California, who wrote earlier this year that there was evidence that Trump and his allies were plotting to defraud the US government and to obstruct an official proceeding. The opinion was handed down by US District Judge David O. Carter in a dispute over whether the House could access certain emails sent to and from former Trump attorney John Eastman.\n\nThe judge cited emails discussing Trump’s awareness that certain voter fraud claims being made in court were inaccurate as evidence of a plot to defraud the federal government. To explain his finding of evidence of obstruction, the judge pointed to emails that showed that the Trump team was contemplating filing lawsuits not to obtain legitimate legal relief, but to meddle in congressional proceedings.\n\nA House referral for an insurrection charge would be a more aggressive move. It’s a crime to assist or engage in “in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws.” Judges have used the term “insurrection” to describe the January 6 attack on Congress’ certification of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut the Justice Department has not opted to bring the charge in its hundreds of US Capitol riot cases. Instead, prosecutors have relied on criminal statutes related to violence, obstruction of an official proceeding, and, in some limited cases, seditious conspiracy.\n\nWho else could be referred? The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies including, Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, multiple sources told CNN earlier this month.\n\nAnother source cautioned at the time that while names were being considered, there was still discussion to be had before they were finalized.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nRep. Schiff: Jan. 6 committee considering how to handle uncooperative GOP lawmakers\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, said Sunday the panel is considering how to hold accountable the GOP lawmakers who defied their subpoenas.\n\nSchiff said the committee would be considering this on Monday, noting that the panel has weighed whether it is better to criminally refer members of Congress to other parts of the federal government or if Congress should “police its own.” Such congressional mechanisms could include censure and referrals to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nFive House Republicans have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 panel: GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe select committee is set to hold its final public hearing today and release its full report on Wednesday. The panel is expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe impact House referrals could have remains unclear because the Department of Justice special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut in addition to criminal referrals, Jan. 6 committee Chairman Bennie Thompson told reporters that the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\n“Censure was something that we have considered. Ethics referrals is something we have considered,” Schiff said Sunday, noting that the committee will disclose its decision Monday.\n\nCNN previously reported that the panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies, including former Trump attorney John Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark and former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to multiple sources.\n\nWhy today\'s Jan. 6 committee session is a meeting and not a hearing\n\nNearly two years removed from the violent attack on the US Capitol, the House select committee tasked with finding out exactly what happened is about to show its hand.\n\nThe panel will hold its final public meeting on Monday, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday.\n\nUnlike previous gatherings of the committee, Monday’s is a business meeting rather than a hearing as no witnesses are set to testify.\n\nWhat to expect from the session: The public meeting, scheduled for 1:00 p.m. ET, is expected to see the panel announce that it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department.\n\nThe committee will release an executive summary of the investigation’s report on Monday after the meeting, a committee aide said Sunday. The final report, to be released two days later, will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nWhy now? Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nA recap of what unfolded in the Jan. 6 committee\'s hearing in October\n\nThe House select committee’s October hearing on the Capitol Hill insurrection used testimony and evidence to demonstrate how former President Donald Trump knew he had lost the election but still went forward with efforts to overturn the results, leading to the attack on the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHere’s a recap of what unfolded at the hearing:\n\nThe committee voted to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony.\n\nPreviously unseen footage aired from the DC-area Army base where congressional leaders took refuge during the insurrection.\n\nElaine Chao, who resigned from her post as Trump’s secretary of Transportation a day after the insurrection, spoke in personal terms about her disgust toward the attack when she testified. “I think the events at the Capitol, however they occurred, were shocking,” she said.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, provided new testimony to the committee relaying anecdotes of Trump acknowledging he had lost the election.\n\nThe panel revealed some of what they had learned from the 1 million Secret Service records obtained within roughly three months since the last January 6 committee hearing.\n\nThe committee revealed new evidence that Trump had devised a plan, well before any votes were counted, to declare victory no matter what the election results were.\n\nCommittee members interviewed Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, last month but ultimately her testimony was not featured as part of the panel’s hearing in October.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHere\'s what the Jan. 6 committee chair said about the referrals the panel will announce Monday\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters last week that the panel will make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department in Monday’s meeting.\n\nWhat this means: Criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack ongoing.\n\nCommittee members see criminal referrals as a critical part of their work, putting their views on the record in order to complete their investigation – not as a way to pressure DOJ, sources have told CNN.\n\nThompson told CNN that the panel is looking at five to six categories of referrals beyond those deemed criminal, but has not decided on the specific number of individuals.\n\nThompson said that in addition to criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, there could be other categories of referrals the committee makes such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nThompson told reporters last Tuesday that Monday’s public meeting will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals.\n\nA subcommittee of members has made recommendations to the full committee about various referrals. During the public meeting, the full committee is expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nCNN reported earlier this month that the committee is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to former President Donald Trump,\n\nA reminder of the key events that unfolded during the Jan. 6 insurrection\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is set to lay out its findings in a final report. When and how the events occurred that day have been a key part of the committee’s probe since the panel formed in July 2021.\n\nSupporters of then-President Trump breached the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, engulfing the building in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to protest against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to certify President Biden’s win.\n\nHere’s how key events unfolded throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump’s speech:\n\nAt 1:10 p.m. ET, while Congress began the process of affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, Trump encouraged his supporters to protest at the US Capitol. Despite promising he would join them, Trump retreated to the White House in his SUV and watched on television as the violence unfolded on Capitol Hill.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. ET, hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers “traitors” for doing their jobs.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Then-Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.\n\nAn armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.\n\nThe Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they had successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they were removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.\n\nThe US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building.\n\nWith about 30 minutes to go before Washington, DC’s 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds. It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.\n\nLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business — namely, confirming Biden’s win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.\n\nProceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence — who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary — bringing the Senate session back into order.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier on the evening of Jan. 6 that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session that night.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the “United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.”\n\nIt took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning (Jan. 7, 2021), but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden’s election win.\n\nSee the full timeline of events here.\n\nWhy the committee is wrapping up its investigation\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters the committee will hold its final public meeting on Monday and that the panel’s full report will come out December 21.\n\nThompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said the committee will approve the panel’s final report on Dec. 19 and make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department, but the public will not see the final report until two days later.\n\n“We will do all of the business of the committee on the 19th,” Thompson said, which includes voting on the final report.\n\nMembers of the committee have promised to have the committee’s report released before the end of the year, as Republicans are expected to dissolve the committee when they take over the chamber in the next Congress.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe other notable investigations Trump faces\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, whose third White House bid has already become mired in controversy, is facing a myriad of legal issues, alongside his business and allies.\n\nAside from the Jan. 6 committee’s probe, here are some other notable investigations involving Trump:\n\nTax returns.The House Ways and Means Committee finally got access to the former president’s tax returns after the Supreme Court dealt a massive defeat to Trump, paving the way for the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the documents to the Democratic-led House. The committee’s chairman, Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sought the tax returns from the IRS in 2019, and the agency, under the Trump administration, initially resisted turning them over.\n\nMar-a-Lago documents. Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed special counsel Jack Smith to oversee the Justice Department criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were brought to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury in Washington has been empaneled and has interviewed potential witnesses to how Trump handled the documents.\n\n2020 Election. The Justice Department has an investigation of its own into the post-2020 election period. While DOJ has not acted publicly during the so-called quiet period leading up to the midterms, a grand jury in Washington has been hearing from witnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is overseeing a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. The probe was launched following Trump’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.\n\nTrump Organization. New York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation, sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\nJames alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.\n\nRead more about other investigations here.\n\nThese are the 9 members on the Jan. 6 committee\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report.\n\nThe committee is made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nChair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California\n\nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California\n\nRepublicans\n\nVice chair: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nHere\'s what a criminal referral is — and what it means for the Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection is set to make announcements at its final public meeting on Monday about criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\nSo what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case.\n\nWith the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nBut whether the department brings charges will depend on whether the facts and the evidence support a prosecution, Attorney General Merrick Garland has said. Garland will make the ultimate call on charging decisions.\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chair of the Jan. 6 committee, has said the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nEx-police officer who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 says he wants to see DOJ indict Trump\n\nMichael Fanone, a former DC police officer and CNN law enforcement analyst, told CNN he would like to see the referrals from the Jan. 6 committee lead to an indictment of former President Donald Trump.\n\nFanone was beaten by rioters during the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.\n\n“I would like to see those individuals put on trial and then again, as I’ve said many times, as Americans we should accept the results of those trials, even if it includes a guilty verdict for former President Donald Trump and jail time,” he said.\n\nFanone also said he is “hopeful” the Justice Department will bring an indictment against Trump.\n\nThe White House is expected to watch quietly as Jan. 6 committee delivers final report this week\n\nWhen the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol delivers its ultimate conclusion to the public this week – holding a final public meeting on Monday and announcing expected criminal referrals to the Justice Department, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday – the White House is expected to watch quietly and decline to offer judgment on any recommendations that the panel may make to the Justice Department.\n\nFor much of the year, top White House officials have made painstaking efforts to avoid delivering specific commentary on the panel’s work. There was one goal in particular of utmost urgency: staying clear of any moves that might suggest that the White House was trying to exert influence on the DOJ.\n\nAnd those efforts are likely to become even more imperative for the Biden White House after the committee refers at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, as a source familiar with the matter said the committee was expected to do this week.\n\nOne White House official told CNN ahead of the committee’s upcoming last meeting on Monday that it would continue to not weigh in on any potential referrals or actions that the panel may take. Another official said this would be in line with the White House’s efforts this year to avoid “running pundit” on the panel’s work.\n\nBut officials also noted that President Biden himself has been clear in his public remarks about the significance of what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, the importance of the committee’s work, not to mention his rejection of last year’s insurrection and the threats to the country’s democratic systems.\n\nIndeed, Biden made that a central theme of his political message in the lead-up to the midterm elections – that decision drew criticism from some fellow Democrats who argued he needed to have a nearly singular focus on the economy, but ultimately left the White House feeling vindicated after Democrats far outperformed expectations.\n\nAnd in the rare moments that Biden did directly comment on the committee, he made clear that he believes the members are doing work critical to documenting history.\n\n“It’s important the American people understand what truly happened and to understand that the same forces that led January 6 remain at work today,” Biden said this summer.\n\nIn October, following a hearing that revealed evidence and testimony from former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchison who said Trump continued efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election even though he knew he had lost reelection, Biden described the testimony and video as “absolutely devastating.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/20/1144303656/5-takeaways-from-the-final-jan-6-committee-hearing', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump referred for criminal charges in final Jan. 6 hearing : NPR', 'Snippet': 'A video of former President Donald Trump is shown on a screen as the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol holds its final meeting on Capitol Hill Monday.', 'Full_text': 'The congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol referred former President Donald Trump for four criminal charges related to an insurrection that he inspired because he couldn\'t publicly accept that he\'d lost an election.\n\nIn the face of it all, that former president already announced he is running again to win back the job.\n\nThat\'s the state of American politics, with a divided populace and millions purposely not paying attention to the evidence presented by the committee, just two weeks ahead of the two-year anniversary of the riot.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is out of time. Republicans are set to take control of the House, and the committee is expected to dissolve. So the legal ball will now be in the Justice Department\'s court, while the political one rests with the voters.\n\n""Accountability that can only be found in the criminal justice system,"" committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said. ""We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a roadmap to justice and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we\'ve provided to aid in their work.""\n\nHere are five takeaways of what we learned from the committee\'s last hearing on Monday:\n\n1. Trump — and others — will be referred to the Justice Department for criminal charges.\n\nThe big news out of the final hearing was that after a lengthy investigation, the members of the committee were convinced there was enough evidence to charge Trump on four things:\n\nObstruction of an official proceeding;\n\nConspiracy to defraud the United States;\n\nConspiracy to make a false statement; and\n\nConspiracy to defraud the U.S. by assisting, aiding or comforting those involved in an insurrection\n\nNow, that doesn\'t mean Trump will be charged. The committee has no power over what the Justice Department does. The Justice Department has its own investigation of Trump that\'s been ongoing and currently run by special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith once Trump announced he was running for president again as a way to show independence from the investigation.\n\n""Ours is not a system of justice, where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass,"" said committee member Jamie Raskin, D-Md., announcing the referrals.\n\n2. Members of Congress were referred to the House ethics committee.\n\nThe committee also announced that four members of Congress, who never complied with subpoenas, were referred to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nThey are Republican congressmen:\n\nKevin McCarthy of California;\n\nJim Jordan of Ohio;\n\nScott Perry of Pennsylvania; and\n\nAndy Biggs of Arizona\n\nAll are close allies of Trump, and their resistance in the face of the rules has been emblematic of the antagonistic style of U.S. politics that was growing even before Trump came on the scene.\n\nWhether anything happens to them, though, is unclear since Republicans will control the iteration of the ethics committee in the next Congress and McCarthy is in line to be the next speaker.\n\n3. There\'s lots of evidence Trump knew the truth, but just didn\'t want to be seen as a loser.\n\nAll of what occurred Jan. 6 likely happened simply because Trump didn\'t have an exit ramp, a way to save face after his 2020 election loss.\n\nThat\'s been evident to those of us who\'ve covered Trump for a while, but it was affirmed by Hope Hicks, a former communications adviser in the Trump White House, someone who was very close to Trump.\n\nHicks, whom we heard from for the first time Monday in the course of these hearings, said in taped testimony that she told Trump she was becoming concerned that these false claims of fraud were damaging his legacy.\n\nThis was Trump\'s response:\n\n""He said something along the lines of, \'You know nobody will care about my legacy if I lose,\' "" Hicks said, "" \'So that won\'t matter, the only thing that matters is winning.\' ""\n\nThere is plenty of evidence Trump — and his team — knew he lost, that the allegations of fraud were baseless and that he knew what he was doing, according to testimony from multiple former Trump administration officials.\n\n""He was—he had—usually he had pretty clear eyes,"" said Bill Stepien, the Trump 2020 campaign manager, according to written testimony released in a report by the committee. ""Like, he understood, you know — you know, we told him where we thought the race was, and I think he was pretty realistic with our viewpoint, in agreement with our viewpoint of kind of the forecast and the uphill climb we thought he had.""\n\nStepien added: ""We\'d have to, you know, relay the news that, yeah, that tip that someone told you about those votes or that fraud or, you know, nothing came of it. That would be our job as, you know, the truth telling squad and, you know, not — not a fun job to be, you know, much — it\'s an easier job to be telling the president about, you know, wild allegations. It\'s a harder job to be telling him on the back end that, yeah, that wasn\'t true.""\n\nOne of Trump\'s campaign lawyers, Alex Cannon, in a mid-to-late November phone call with former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, said, per the report, that he found nothing ""sufficient to change the results in any of the key States.""\n\nMeadows responded saying, ""So there is no there, there?""\n\nEven Trump counsel Rudy Giuliani admitted during his deposition to the committee: ""I do not think the machines stole the election.""\n\nA federal judge noted that Trump was told by email ""that the specific numbers of voter fraud were wrong but continued to tout those numbers, both in court and in public."" And he ""signed a verification swearing under oath that the incorporated, inaccurate numbers \'are true and correct\' or \'believed to be true and correct\' to the best of his knowledge and belief.""\n\nThese aren\'t people who are aligned with Democrats or were ""Never Trump"" or ""Trump Haters,"" as the former president likes to say. In fact, the opposite is true in most of the testimony that\'s been aired by the committee.\n\nIt\'s up to rank-and-file Trump voters whether they can bring themselves to acknowledge the realities without lapsing into baseless conspiracies.\n\n4. Whether the findings will matter politically is unclear.\n\nIt\'s no secret that the country is divided politically and partisanship, particularly among Republicans, has become entrenched. So despite the primary evidence — with testimony from Republicans who were aligned with Trump — people have been watching selectively.\n\nThe committee in its report recognized this:\n\n""Although the Committee\'s hearings were viewed live by tens of millions of Americans and widely publicized in nearly every major news source, the Committee also recognizes that other news outlets and commentators have actively discouraged viewers from watching, and that millions of other Americans have not yet seen the actual evidence addressed by this Report.""\n\nSo the committee said it\'s releasing video summaries with each relevant piece of evidence. And it\'s likely why the beginning of the hearing included so many clips of previously seen testimony from past hearings, almost like the recap of a prior season of a series on Netflix.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest those who watched were moved. Before the hearings, just 48% of independents in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll said they thought Trump was to blame a ""great deal"" or ""good amount"" for what happened that day. After several hearings, the July survey found that the percentage blaming Trump spiked to 57%.\n\nRepublicans were only up marginally — and still fewer than 1-in-5 said Trump was responsible for what happened.\n\nEighty percent of Democrats and 55% of independents said they were paying ""a lot"" or ""some"" attention to the hearings. But 56% of Republicans said they were not.\n\nIt\'s not hard to draw a straight line between the numbers of those paying attention and the movement — or lack thereof — in the survey.\n\n5. The ball is in DOJ\'s — and the public\'s — court.\n\nProgressives have been irritated with Garland\'s methodical (read: slow) pace of pursuing charges against Trump. But it\'s going to be up to the special counsel whether to bring charges or what they are.\n\nThey do not have to act on what the Jan. 6 committee recommends, though investigators are paying close attention to the details of its findings. But don\'t expect to hear much about the special counsel\'s progress, as the DOJ tends to stay pretty quiet, if not wholly silent, on the details of ongoing investigations until they present them in court.\n\nPolitically, it\'s going to be up to voters to choose. Trump will likely retain support with his base. As we noted, Republicans have been the least likely to be paying close attention to these hearings. In a multi-candidate primary, Trump remains the front-runner for the GOP nomination.\n\nBut he\'s in legal trouble in multiple states, not just federally, and many of his preferred candidates — and election deniers — lost in swing states. So whether it\'s because of the chaos that often surrounds him, the threat he presents to U.S. democracy and faith in its elections, or simply because his brand is not a winner in competitive states where Republicans likely need to win to take over the White House and Congress, Trump is at his most vulnerable point since winning the presidency six years ago.\n\nAnd the members of this committee — some of whom won\'t be returning to Congress because of the wrath, or potential wrath, of Trump\'s base — certainly hope voters respond.\n\n""The future of our democracy rests in your hands,"" Thompson said. ""It\'s up to the people to decide who is deserving of the public trust.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/jan-6-committee-final-report/index.html', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 committee releases first transcripts from interviews - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The House Jan. 6 committee released the first of hundreds of interview transcripts it compiled during its investigation into the insurrection at the US Capitol and former President Donald Trump ...', 'Full_text': 'Roger Stone’s interview with the Jan. 6 select committee lasted 51 minutes and pleaded with Fifth Amendment for every question that was asked, the panel’s transcripts show.\n\nStone did not comment on anything the panel put in front of him, including photographs, public statements, video clips of interviews, and text messages. He also took the Fifth when asked basic questions like his age.\n\nStone did not reveal who paid for his private flight from Florida to Washington, DC, in the days before Jan. 6, or who paid for his hotel room at the Willard InterContinental, which is where Stone and other Trump allies set a “war room” on Jan. 6. He also would not confirm which events he was invited to speak at on Jan. 5 and 6, by whom, or if he even attended them at all.\n\nHe was previously convicted of lying to Congress during its investigation into Russian meddling in 2016. Prosecutors argued that he lied to protect then-President Donald Trump, who pardoned him in 2020, before leaving office.\n\nThrough its questioning, the select committee investigators delved into how the Oath Keepers coordinated to protect Stone when he was in Washington, DC, on Jan. 5 and 6, 2021. A group chat through the encrypted messaging app Signal included Stone and Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes, who has been convicted of seditious conspiracy. Stone wrote, “this group is for all event organizers and VIP speakers who need Oath Keepers PSD or event security on Jan 5/6 so they can talk to me and my top OK team leaders all in one place.” Rhodes later messaged that Kelly Meggs from Florida would be Stone’s protection.\n\nThe select committee asked about text exchanges between Stone and “Stop the Steal” rally organizer Ali Alexander, who also was interviewed by the panel, from Jan. 6 where the pair discuss logistics about the rallies that day.\n\n“As I expected, no speaking spot, no VIP entrance for any of my people” Stone said to Alexander at approximately 10:02 a.m. A few hours later, Alexander wrote to stone, “get your ass to the US Capitol” and added “we have a stage & the presidents order.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s one-time national security adviser, Michael Flynn, asserted his Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination to nearly every question asked by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection during his interview with the panel, the transcript of his testimony released Wednesday confirms.\n\nFlynn answered a series of initial questions about his background and military career, acknowledging for example that he joined a group called “The America Project,” which was founded by former Overstock CEO and known election denier Patrick Byrne.\n\nHe also answered when the committee asked if he knew the reason Trump pardoned him.\n\n“Because I think he saw my whole case as a travesty of justice,” Flynn said.\n\nBut when asked why he failed to produce any documents pursuant to the committee’s subpoena, Flynn invoked the Fifth Amendment, ultimately doing so for every other question during the course of his March deposition.\n\nFlynn’s lawyer noted during the interview that his client was appearing before the committee while a lawsuit to quash the panel’s subpoena was still pending.\n\nAmong the questions Flynn responded to by invoking his Fifth Amendment protections, were about his communications with Trump, White House staff, officials at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, officials at the Department of Justice and attorneys representing the former president about election fraud or other irregularities.\n\nMore background: CNN has previously reported that Flynn played a central role in not only spreading baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud and pushed US officials to investigate claims about foreign manipulation of voting machines.\n\nDuring an Oval Office meeting with Trump in mid-December 2020, Flynn also proposed using the federal government to seize voting machines, sources previously told CNN.\n\nHouse Republicans released a report Wednesday focused on security failures at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, highlighting well-documented breakdowns in intelligence sharing, Capitol security and coordination between various law enforcement agencies that responded that day.\n\nTheir primary recommendation centers around reforming the Capitol Police Board and bolstering congressional oversight of the Capitol police force – two issues that were identified by lawmakers of both parties in the wake of Jan. 6.\n\nBut the GOP report is silent on other efforts to disrupt the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election and selective in its criticism of political leaders and their culpability in the security breakdowns on Jan. 6. The report resurfaces largely unfounded allegations to cast blame on Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while glossing over former President Donald Trump’s own role.\n\nRepublicans cast the report as a rebuttal to the House select committee’s investigation into Jan. 6 as they are set to take control of the chamber and endeavor to take back the narrative. Republican lawmakers have said the security failures are paramount and that the select committee overstepped its mandate in its 17-month probe.\n\nThe Democrat-led select committee had planned to release its final report on Wednesday but has delayed the rollout until Thursday. An executive summary released on Monday lays blame for the insurrection squarely on Trump.\n\nMore on the report: The GOP report comes from the five Republicans who Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy initially appointed to serve on the select committee before deciding members of his party would not participate.\n\nIt includes a timeline of events that occurred on Jan. 6, making no mention of the fact that Trump waited hours before calling on the rioters to leave the US Capitol that day and omitting incendiary remarks he made at the rally preceding the attack.\n\nInstead, the report paints Trump as only encouraging his supporters at the White House Ellipse to march to the US Capitol and demonstrate “peacefully,” noticeably omitting other parts of the speech, including when he encouraged rally goers to “fight light hell.”\n\nSimilarly, the timeline includes a tweet Trump sent after the Capitol had been breached, saying: “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”\n\nMissing from the report is Trump’s tweet in which he eventually told the rioters to leave the Capitol – several hours after the deadly riot began.\n\nThe select committee has revealed witness testimony from several former White House officials saying Trump repeatedly refused to call off the rioters despite being asked to do so by a number of his closest advisers.\n\nThe GOP report also doesn’t address Trump’s claim that he issued a directive prior to Jan. 6 to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to the Capitol that day.\n\nTrump’s former Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, in an interview with the select committee, denied Trump gave him formal orders authorizing the deployment of National Guard troops to the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report expected to be released Wednesday.\n\nThe committee is made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nChair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California\n\nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\n\nRep.

Adam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nThe final report the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack is set to release Wednesday launches a new era for criminal investigators, politicians, and members of the public who have been eager to see the nuts and bolts of its work.\n\nHere’s what to watch for:\n\nDetail on possible obstruction of the investigation\n\nIn the summary of its report released earlier this week, the panel revealed it is aware of “multiple efforts by President Donald Trump to contact Select Committee witnesses,” adding that DOJ is aware “of at least one of those circumstances.”\n\nThe summary released Monday also claimed the panel has a “range of evidence suggesting specific efforts to obstruct the Committee’s investigation.” That includes concerns that attorneys paid by Trump’s political committee or allied groups “have specific incentives to defend President Trump rather than zealously represent their own clients.”\n\nDetails of Trump’s effort to visit the Capitol\n\nThe summary details that the panel was ultimately unable to get former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato to corroborate a bombshell moment during the public hearings, in which Hutchinson recalled Ornato describing Trump’s altercation with the head of his security detail when he was told he would not be taken to the Capitol following his speech on the Ellipse.\n\nThe committee summary said both Hutchinson and a White House employee testified to the panel about the Ornato conversation. But “Ornato professed that he did not recall either communication, and that he had no knowledge at all about the President’s anger.”\n\nThe committee wrote that it “has significant concerns about the credibility of this testimony” and vowed to release his transcript publicly.\n\nFundraising efforts\n\nIn terms of financing after the 2020 presidential election and through the Jan. 6 rallies, the committee says it gathered evidence indicating that Trump “raised roughly one quarter of a billion dollars in fundraising efforts between the election and January 6th.”\n\n“Those solicitations persistently claimed and referred to election fraud that did not exist,” the panel wrote.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, has said the panel has evidence that members of the Trump family and inner circle – including Kimberly Guilfoyle – personally benefited from money that was raised based on the former president’s false election claims, but the panel has never gone as far to say a financial crime has been committed.\n\nRead more on what to watch for here.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee made a startling allegation on Monday, claiming it had evidence that a Trump-backed attorney urged a key witness to mislead the committee about details they recalled. In the executive summary of the final report, the committee revisited the issue in its handoff of the investigation to the Justice Department.\n\nAccording to the report, “the lawyer had advised the witness that the witness could, in certain circumstances, tell the Committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them.” The committee declined to identify the people.\n\nWhat we know: However, CNN has learned that Stefan Passantino, the top ethics attorney in the Trump White House, is the lawyer who allegedly advised his then-client, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, to tell the committee that she did not recall details that she did, sources familiar with the committee’s work tell CNN. Before her public testimony, Hutchinson dropped Passantino and got a new lawyer.\n\nTrump’s Save America political action committee funded Passantino and his law firm Elections LLC, including paying for his representation of Hutchinson, other sources tell CNN. The committee report notes the lawyer did not tell his client who was paying for the legal services.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Passantino said he didn’t advise Hutchinson to mislead the committee. “I represented Ms. Hutchinson honorably, ethically, and fully consistent with her sole interests as she communicated them to me. I believed Ms. Hutchinson was being truthful and cooperative with the Committee throughout the several interview sessions in which I represented her.”\n\nPassantino pointed out it’s not uncommon for people to change lawyers “because their interests or strategies change,” according to his statement. He also said political committees sometimes cover client fees “at the client’s request.”\n\nBy Tuesday, Passantino’s professional biography had been removed from the website of a midwestern-based law firm where he was a partner – and he acknowledged in his statement he was on a leave of absence from the firm “given the distraction of this matter.” He remains a partner at Elections LLC.\n\nLawyers must follow extensive ethics guidelines as part of their profession, including avoiding conflicts of interest that could compromise their representation of a client. According to legal ethics experts, a lawyer swaying their client’s testimony in a way that wouldn’t be entirely truthful could be looked at as possible obstruction of an investigation.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has started handing over evidence — documents and transcripts — to the Justice Department in the last week, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith had sent a letter to the committee on Dec. 5, requesting all of the information from the panel’s investigation, another source told CNN.\n\nThe information transfer focuses specifically on former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s former election lawyer John Eastman, the source added. The DOJ also received Meadows text messages from the committee.\n\nThe panel also has started to share transcripts of witness interviews pertaining to the false slates of electors and the pressure campaign by the former president and his allies on certain states to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\n“We’ve actually given some transcripts to the Department of Justice during the last month,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the select committee, told CNN Monday.\n\nThe committee also is slated to release its full final report today.\n\nSpokespersons for the committee and for the special counsel did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nThe final report from the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, will include information about Republican National Committee fundraising directly after the 2020 presidential election, what Secret Service knew ahead of the attack and the response by the National Guard, committee member Rep. Pete Aguilar said earlier this month.\n\nThe comments from Aguilar expand on themes the committee has presented in its previous hearings and detail to a new level what is expected to appear in the final report. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, has previously told CNN the panel’s final report will contain eight chapters.\n\nSome information in the report will be redacted due to security concerns, according to Aguilar.\n\nHe added that “there have been some conversations with people who came before us, where we indicated we would redact some small pieces,” such as current workplaces, that are important to protect.\n\nWith its mic drop finale, the House committee investigating the US Capitol insurrection left a fateful question hanging over Washington, Donald Trump and the 2024 presidential campaign: will the ex-president be charged with a crime?\n\nThe committee announced in its final public meeting on Monday it was recommending to the Justice Department that Trump be prosecuted on at least four charges, carefully matching the panel’s catalog of violence, lies, insurrection and dereliction of duty up to and on January 6, 2021, with specific legal statutes.\n\nYet the panel, despite delivering what it called a “roadmap to justice,” has no power to try Trump and its decisions are not binding on the Justice Department.\n\nThe DOJ has its own investigation and faces prosecutorial decisions that require a higher bar than the committee’s political gambits. The potential charges concerned also have little case law precedent.\n\nAnd while both Attorney General Merrick Garland and the House committee have long argued that every American should be subject to equal justice, the gravity of indicting an ex-president and current White House candidate who has already used violence as a political tool means the department’s dilemma is among the most fateful in American history.\n\nMore broadly, the committee has now sketched the most urgent framing of a perennial question about Trump’s riotous careers in business and politics: Will he ever face accountability for his rule-breaking conduct?\n\nThe question is especially acute given that the norm crushed this time almost toppled US democracy.\n\nRead the full analysis here.\n\nFor months, the Jan. 6 committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. On Monday, the committee didn’t equivocate.\n\nThe committee referred Trump to the DOJ on at least four criminal charges, including:\n\nObstructing an official proceeding\n\nDefrauding the United States\n\nMaking false statements\n\nAssisting or aiding an insurrection\n\nThe panel said in its executive summary that it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nSo what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nIn practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nBut the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department’s court.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said during Monday’s meeting that he has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nAfter the panel’s meeting, Thompson told CNN that the evidence that supports the panel’s decision to refer Trump to the DOJ is “clear,” adding that he is “convinced” that the department will ultimately charge Trump.\n\nCNN’s Tierney Sneed contributed reporting to this post.\n\nOn Monday, the January 6 committee released an executive summary of its report, and it plans to release the full report on Wednesday, as well as transcripts of committee interviews.\n\nHere are takeaways from the committee’s final public meeting:\n\nCommittee refers Trump to DOJ. The committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nAll roads lead to Trump. Committee members repeatedly pointed to Trump’s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on January 6. Monday’s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break “the foundation of American democracy.”\n\nCommittee uses video to illustrate case. The committee showed a video montage laying out all of its allegations against Trump, from witnesses saying that Trump was told he lost the election by his aides to the former president’s failure to act on January 6 as the violence at the Capitol was unfolding. The montage went step-by-step through Trump’s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters.\n\nA bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois described how his House GOP colleagues were complicit in Trump’s efforts to overturn the election. He highlighted evidence that Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to “put the facade of legitimacy” on his voter fraud claims so “Republican congressmen … can distort and destroy and create doubt” about the 2020 election results.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has concluded that former President Donald Trump was ultimately responsible for the insurrection, laying out for the public and the Justice Department a trove of evidence for why he should be prosecuted for multiple crimes.\n\nThe summary describes in extensive detail how Trump tried to overpower, pressure and cajole anyone who wasn’t willing to help him overturn his election defeat — while knowing that many of his schemes were unlawful. His relentless arm-twisting included election administrators in key states, senior Justice Department leaders, state lawmakers, and others. The report even suggests possible witness tampering with the committee’s investigation.\n\nThe full report, based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation by the nine-member bipartisan committee, will be released Wednesday, along with along with transcripts and other materials collected in the investigation.\n\nHere are some key things from the report summary:\n\nCommittee referring Trump and others to DOJ: The House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Trump attorney John Eastman and “others.” The report summary says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nTrump’s false victory was “premeditated”: The committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\nTrump’s belief that the election is stolen is no excuse, lawmakers say: Sources familiar with Trump’s legal strategy in the Justice Department probe have told CNN that his attorneys believe prosecutors face an uphill battle in proving he did not believe the election was stolen despite being told as much by senior members of his own administration.\n\nIn making its case for a Justice Department prosecution of Trump, the House committee took aim at that possible defense.\n\nSeveral members of Congress being referred to House Ethics Committee: The select committee is referring several Republican lawmakers who refused to cooperate with the investigation to the House Ethics Committee. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona, could all face possible sanctions for their refusal to comply with committee subpoenas.\n\nTrump and others may try this again, committee warns: The summary’s section outlining the referrals makes a case for why the Justice Department’s prosecutions should extend beyond the rioters who physically breached the Capitol.\n\nThe committee says that Trump “believed then, and continues to believe now, that he is above the law, not bound by our Constitution and its explicit checks on Presidential authority.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61753870', 'Headline': 'January 6 hearing: Trump accused of attempted coup - BBC', 'Snippet': 'Widow of fallen officer: ""6 January was the worst day of his life"" Former US President Donald Trump orchestrated last year\'s Capitol riot in an ""attempted coup"", a congressional inquiry has heard ...', 'Full_text': 'Former US President Donald Trump orchestrated last year\'s Capitol riot in an ""attempted coup"", a congressional inquiry has heard as a hearing opened into the raid.\n\nLiz Cheney, the Republican vice-chair of the committee, said Mr Trump had ""lit the flame of this attack"".\n\nBennie Thompson, a Democrat, said the riot endangered American democracy.\n\nTrump supporters stormed Congress on 6 January 2021 as lawmakers met to certify Joe Biden\'s election victory.\n\nAfter almost a year of investigation, the Democratic-led US House of Representatives select committee opened on Thursday evening by showing clips from interviews it conducted with members of Mr Trump\'s inner circle.\n\nThe timing was geared to reach huge evening TV audiences across the US.\n\nFootage was aired of testimony by former US Attorney General Bill Barr saying he had repeatedly told the former president that he had lost the election and his claims of fraud were wrong.\n\n""We can\'t live in a world where the incumbent administration stays in power based on its view, unsupported by specific evidence, that there was fraud in the election,"" said the former attorney general.\n\nThe hearing also featured a recording of testimony by Ivanka Trump, the ex-president\'s daughter, saying she ""accepted"" Mr Barr\'s rejection of her father\'s conspiracy theory.\n\nAnd there was an audible gasp in the committee room as Ms Cheney read an account that claimed Mr Trump, when told the rioters were chanting for Vice President Mike Pence to be hanged for refusing to block the election results, suggested that he ""deserves it"".\n\nBefore the House inquiry opened on Thursday evening - the first of six hearings expected this month - Mr Trump dismissed it as a ""political HOAX"".\n\nThe former president has been publicly hinting about another White House run in 2024.

It was Trump\'s last stand.""\n\nMs Cheney, the vice-chair of the committee and a Wyoming congresswoman, said: ""Those who invaded our Capitol and battled law enforcement for hours were motivated by what President Trump had told them: that the election was stolen and that he was the rightful president.\n\n""President Trump summoned the mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack.""\n\nAt no point did he ask law enforcement services to protect the Capitol, Ms Cheney said, instead it was Mr Pence who did that.\n\nRunning just over two hours, the unprecedented prime-time congressional hearing on the Capitol attack was a decidedly mixed bag.\n\nThe video evidence of the 6 January events, and the dramatic personal testimony of officer Caroline Edwards, were powerful reminders of the pain and suffering that day.\n\nThe extended statement by Liz Cheney - who has put her career in jeopardy with her criticism of the former president - was full of allegations and accusations but overly dense.\n\nAn American sitting down to watch the proceedings instead of their regular Thursday night entertainment may have not received the slickly packaged production that was promised.\n\nBut if they had forgotten what it was like on 6 January - the desperation and the drama - there was plenty to remind them.\n\nWhat they do with that reminder, however, remains to be seen.\n\nCaroline Edwards, the first police officer injured in the attack, testified that she was called a ""traitor"" and a ""dog"" by the rioters before she was knocked unconscious.\n\nShe described later encountering amid the melee a ""ghostly pale"" Officer Brian Sicknick, who died a day following the attack after suffering two strokes.\n\n""I was slipping in people\'s blood,"" Officer Edwards told lawmakers. ""It was carnage. It was chaos.""\n\n""Never in my wildest dreams did I think that as a police officer, as a law enforcement officer, I would find myself in the middle of a battle,"" she added.\n\nA British documentary filmmaker, Nick Quested, who was tracking the Proud Boys, a far-right group, on the day of the attack, also gave evidence.\n\nHe described his surprise at the anger and violence of the rampaging ""insurrectionists"".\n\nFour people died on the day of the US Capitol riot: an unarmed woman shot by police and the others of natural causes.\n\nAs Americans grapple with galloping inflation, soaring petrol prices and a baby-formula crisis, US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has seen his popularity with voters dip below Mr Trump\'s approval rating at the same point in his tenure.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy - who was initially critical of Mr Trump in the aftermath of the Capitol riot, but has since shifted his tone - called the committee a ""smokescreen"" for Democrats to overhaul voting laws.\n\nHouse Democrats impeached Mr Trump following the riot, with barely a week left in his presidency.

Here are the findings, with additional context.\n\n1. Beginning election night and continuing through Jan. 6 and thereafter, Donald Trump purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions. These false claims provoked his supporters to violence on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: This reflects the committee’s finding that Mr. Trump’s repeated false claims that the election was rigged had both a political and financial motive. During its second hearing, the panel introduced evidence that Trump supporters donated nearly $100 million to Mr. Trump’s so-called Election Defense Fund but that the money flowed instead into a super PAC the president had created. It was not just “the big lie,” the committee said. It was also “the big rip-off.”\n\n2. Knowing that he and his supporters had lost dozens of election lawsuits, and despite his own senior advisers refuting his election fraud claims and urging him to concede his election loss, Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome.\n\nAnnotation: Mr. Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results of the election and lost all but one of them. Many of the suits, the committee determined, were brought even after some of Mr. Trump’s closest aides — including his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and his attorney general, William P. Barr — told him that there was no fraud that could have changed the outcome of the race.\n\n3. Despite knowing that such an action would be illegal, and that no state had or would submit an altered electoral slate, Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress’s joint session on Jan. 6.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Anaheim spokesman Mike Lyster said the city has ""not formally received the claim but are aware of it and will be reviewing.""\n\nThe lawsuit also names 10 advocacy or political organizations who allegedly pressured city officials and the venues to not host the rally.\n\nGaetz, Greene and their fundraising committees are seeking a declaration saying each of the defendants violated their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association as part of the lawsuit.\n\nThey are also asking for an injunction prohibiting the cities from denying or ""coercing private venues from entering into facilities use contracts with Plaintiffs for future political rallies"" and unspecified damages for emotional distress.\n\nAlexander Haberbush, an attorney representing Greene and Gaetz in the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nGreene, a Georgia congresswoman, and Gaetz, who represents much of the Florida Panhandle, tried to host their rally at two locations in Orange County and one in Riverside in July 2021, but the venues kept backing out.\n\nRead more: After third venue cancels, Gaetz, Greene take \'protest against communism\' to Riverside\n\nThe first location to fall through was the Pacific Hills Banquet & Event Center in Laguna Hills. The venue\'s general manager told the Orange County Register at the time it opted to cancel after learning Gaetz and Greene would be speaking.\n\nThe rally was moved to the Riverside Convention Center, but the city quickly started receiving complaints. Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers ""are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.""\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue\'s conditional use permit would be ""in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.""\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a ""peaceful protest against communism"" outside Riverside City Hall.\n\n“These folks they tried to cancel our venues but they can never cancel our patriotism or our American spirit,” Gaetz said in a video filmed outside Riverside City Hall. “They’ll hear us all throughout Southern California.”\n\nSign up for Essential California, your daily guide to news, views and life in the Golden State.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.pressreader.com/usa/daily-news-los-angeles/20230715/282638922057805', 'Headline': 'GOP reps sue Riverside and Anaheim - PressReader', 'Snippet': 'Gaetz and Greene also tried holding their rally in Anaheim.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day. The rally, which Greene led alongside the New York Young Republicans, drew a crowd of a few dozen Trump supporters, counterprotesters, and curious New Yorkers — all of whom appeared to be outnumbered by media.\n\nThe rally in Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Court House, was less a protest and more like a bizarro carnival. Trump’s Tuesday arraignment took place on an rare New York spring day, which added to the frenetic vibe, as though everyone was unleashed after a long winter.\n\nThe MAGA hats and flags were out, as were a contingent of counterprotesters, imperfectly separated by metal barriers. New Yorkers mingled among them — an artist, a high schooler with a few free periods — who claimed to have wandered down to Lower Manhattan to witness history, or at least the spectacle. And then there were the reporters, swarming everyone in a red hat or with a halfway decent sign.\n\nBut prominent GOP politicians, not so much. The sparse attendance by other elected Republicans highlighted the limitations of what members of the party might be willing to do for Trump, even though they’ve broadly lambasted the charges against him as politically motivated and unfounded.\n\nGreene’s headlining of the event comes after Trump previously called for his supporters to “protest” the charges, a rallying cry that raised concerns of a repeat of the deadly January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when the former president similarly asked supporters to contest the election results. Embattled Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was also spotted by reporters in the crowd of the protest, and was seen headed toward the courthouse where the arraignment was set to take place. Other than that, maybe the highest-profile public figure was the Naked Cowboy.\n\nJanuary 6’s violence — and its legal fallout — have complicated efforts to drum up support for pro-Trump protests. While many lawmakers are eager to show their support for Trump, they’ve largely chosen to do so through fundraising efforts. A previous New York protest on March 20 was also poorly attended, and protests in South Carolina and California drew small crowds this past week as well. Most GOP lawmakers appear unwilling to put themselves in a position where they could be linked to Trump-related violence, and in the face of ongoing trials for insurrectionists, grassroots supporters appear hesitant to do so as well.\n\nThe New York Young Republicans pointedly described the Tuesday rally as a “peaceful protest” that called out the political persecution of Trump’s indictment, with Greene warning participants against violence. The crowd greeted Marjorie Taylor Green’s arrival to the rally with cheers and jeers, but throughout the morning until Trump’s arrival in Lower Manhattan, the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nRepublicans in general have harshly criticized the indictment and framed it as a way for Democrats to attack Trump yet again. Leaders like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), however, have previously urged “calmness” and pushed back on Trump’s calls for protest. They have assisted with the former president’s efforts to use the indictment to raise money, though. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) solicited donations on Fox News, for example, and the Trump campaign claims it’s brought in over $7 million in the past few days.\n\nThe lukewarm Republican response to Trump’s calls for protests, however, indicate that many in the GOP are only willing to go so far, particularly as the specter of the January 6 insurrection continues to loom over the party.\n\n“I think they calculate that they can take a goldilocks strategy — stay in the good graces of their base by not attacking him, but maintain plausible deniability in the future by not attending a protest,” says American University government professor David Barker.\n\nTrump is back, and no one seems to know quite what to make of it\n\nTuesday in Collect Pond Park, Trump supporters were angry about Trump’s indictment, but there was also a sense of anticipation: The thing Trump always said would happen — that he’d be targeted by an establishment that was out to get him — did. They were here to defend Trump, to support him, pray for him, and commiserate together.\n\nMelinda, 61, who drove up to New York from outside Fall’s Church, Virginia, sat on a bench in the park, hours before Trump’s arraignment. “I’m here to pray for the safety of the city and the people and President Trump,” she said.\n\nShe added that she loved her president, pointing to a pin of the presidential seal on the collar of the jacket. For her, the charges felt larger than just Trump. “What’s happening is they’re about to open a Pandora’s box. Because now, nobody’s safe,” Melinda said. “Any president, VP, Supreme Court justice, can now be publicly arrested, so I think it will boomerang.”\n\nThe crowd got bigger as the morning wore on and Trump’s arraignment loomed. There were red hats, of course, but maybe not as many as you might think. The rest fell into two camps: folks in sunglasses and T-shirts, as if they were NYC tourists; and the over-the-top. That included a guy in a banana suit — “Banana Republic” costume, as he explained — with a copy of the US Constitution in his hand.\n\nThe closer to Trump’s arraignment it got, the weirder it got, too: a woman, her body painted white, in a diaper. An Abe Lincoln. A guy in an orange jumpsuit, wearing a Trump mask. As inmate Trump worked the crowd, one woman pointed directly at him. “It’s Hillary Clinton,” she said, ignoring his face. “Hey, Hillary, you finally got locked up.”\n\nAnti-Trump protesters also filtered through. Jojo Keys, 39, from Manhattan, said he was an independent who had come to witness history. When Taylor Green entered the park, he jumped up and down, shouting “Liar, liar!”\n\nThere were also “Fuck Joe Biden” cheers and “USA” chants, and there was a cowbell, somewhere, of course. But mostly, the currency was signs. The ones you know: Make America Great, Trump 2024, Stop the Steal, Q. And then some new ones on the scene, some better than others: “Salem 1692 / Bragg 2023.” “From Build Back Better to Biden, Bragg, Banana Republic in 2 Years.”\n\nMichael Austin, a 59-year-old Manhattanite, had the Build Back Better to Banana Republic sign, which he rested at his feet. In his hands, he held a “Fags for Trump” sign. “It is a seven-year-long, slow-rolling constant coup d’etat,” Austin said. “They have used the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the DHS, and foreign spy agencies to persecute a reformer, who came to reform the corrupt system, and they don’t like it.”\n\nPretty much everyone had cameras out, filming or photographing the scene for their own memories, and maybe to make sure that they had evidence in case anything happened.\n\nThough nothing really did. People cheered, they chatted, they waited. Trump arrived at the courthouse in the afternoon, the crowd noting his arrival with helicopters overhead. “Trump is in the house,” one woman called out. But otherwise, the crowd stood, behind a fence and behind rows of television cameras, facing the court house, knowing, at least, that the former president was inside.\n\nThe lingering impact of January 6\n\nTrump’s calls for protests, which the former president posted in March as he anticipated the indictment, follow significant fallout from the January 6 insurrection. The storming of the Capitol ultimately led to five deaths, 140 injured police officers, and hundreds of arrests. It’s also proven to be politically damaging for Republicans following an intensive investigation by Congress’s January 6 committee, with polling showing that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the attack.\n\nConcerns about the violence that occurred on January 6 have hung over these potential rallies as well, with New York Mayor Eric Adams calling on Taylor Greene and other protesters to be on their “best behavior.” Multiple Republican lawmakers have made similar requests of Trump supporters, like McCarthy, who said in mid-March that “there should not be any violence.”\n\nRelatedly, pro-Trump backers have signaled reluctance about these protests amid concerns they could be a trap laid by federal agents, after more than a thousand people have been charged following the insurrection. As CNN’s Sean Lyngaas, Zachary Cohen, and Donie O’Sullivan reported, pro-Trump forums have included speculation that these demonstrations were a “set up” intended to pin blame on them for violence caused by other groups, like the antifa or antifascist movement. (On January 6, this incorrect theory was used by some Republicans to obscure the role of Trump supporters in the violence and damage that was caused.) An expert also told CNN that Trump backers may be seeking alternate routes to oppose the indictment including specific targeting of officials like District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe combination of lawmakers’ own apparent political concerns, and Trump supporters’ practical worries about a law enforcement “set up,” seem to have dampened the involvement in protests this week.\n\nFor Republican lawmakers, there’s been an ongoing balancing act regarding their backing for Trump. If they were to actively criticize and condemn him, they risk serious electoral blowback much like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who lost her Republican House primary. Tying themselves too closely to Trump, however, also comes with its own risks, particularly for lawmakers in more moderate states and districts. In the 2022 midterms, election-denier candidates in battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan broadly lost. And there are still a lot of unknowns about Trump’s legal woes, as he faces other potential charges in cases involving overturning the election results and his role in January 6.\n\n“Now they must calculate not just the current rank-and-file GOP rallying around Trump, but also what happens if more indictments tumble down in the coming months,” says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\n\nThese collective factors, it seems, have curbed the interest in these protests for now.\n\nUpdate, 5 pm ET: This story has been updated with crowd reactions throughout the arraignment day.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-fights-impeachment-credit-1826462', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene Fights for Impeachment Credit', 'Snippet': 'Representatives Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene speak at a rally on May 27, 2021, in Dalton, Georgia.

Greene and Gaetz, widely viewed as two of the most far-right members of Congress, have shown sympathy for many of the rioters and have attempted to visit the D.C. jail where some riot defendants are being held, to inspect conditions at the facility. Gaetz notably spread a conspiracy theory on the House floor just hours after the attack, claiming that some of the rioters may have been “antifa terrorists.” Greene, meanwhile, has recently compared the riot at the Capitol to the Declaration of Independence, saying it was an attempt to “overthrow tyrants.”\n\nTangent\n\nAs time passes, right-wing condemnation of the attack has gradually been replaced by conspiracy theories. Tucker Carlson, a Fox News prime-time host who anchors the most popular show on cable news, released a three-part series in October called “Patriot Purge.” The series repeated the baseless claim that the January 6 attack was a “false flag” operation actually orchestrated by the government—a notion that has been repeatedly debunked.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Calls Off Press Conference On Capitol Attack Anniversary (Forbes)'}}",90.4,2

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/factchecking-claims-about-the-jan-6-capitol-riot/', 'Headline': 'FactChecking Claims About the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot', 'Snippet': 'Trump supporters clash with police and security forces at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. ... to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://bucshon.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4364', 'Headline': 'ICYMI: NEW REPORT: Speaker Pelosi’s January 6th Failure', 'Snippet': 'Washington, December 22, 2022.

It said changes to USCP intelligence protocols in the lead-up to Jan. 6 ""caused confusion and rendered a key USCP component ineffective"" during the mob violence.\n\nRepublicans accused former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving of being ""compromised by politics,"" coordinating closely with Pelosi and her staff but leaving GOP lawmakers out of discussions about security. The report said Democratic leaders were concerned over the ""optics"" of deploying the National Guard in response to the riot, given the Black Lives Matter riots that took place in the summer of 2020. The GOP lawmakers alleged these concerns prevented early deployment of the National Guard.\n\n""To make matters worse, systemic issues have crippled the security apparatus for years. USCP line officers were under-trained and ill-equipped to protect the Capitol complex,"" the report said. ""One officer testified to investigators that he went into the fight on January 6, 2021 with nothing but his USCP-issued baseball cap. Even if every USCP officer had been at work that day, their numbers would still have been insufficient to hold off the rioters due to a lack of training and equipment. The USCP was set up to fail, and there have been scant signs of progress toward addressing these weaknesses.""\n\nRepublicans said the evidence gathered in their report came from witnesses and USCP sources whose identities are protected for fear of retaliation. Additionally, the House investigators interviewed USCP Chief Tom Manger, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker, and the Assistant Director of the Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division Julie Farnam. The investigation also relied on public documents and news reports to supplement their findings.\n\nDEMOCRATS RELEASE REPORT ON TRUMP TAX RETURNS, REVEALING INCOME, TAXES PAID, IRS AUDIT\n\nThe GOP report is meant to supplement a bipartisan report released by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and the Committee on Rules and Administration last year. That report identified several security, planning and response failures leading up to the riot, including FBI and Homeland Security intelligence officials neglecting to warn of potential violence and USPC unpreparedness.\n\n""The intelligence failures, coupled with the Capitol Police Board’s failure to request National Guard assistance prior to January 6th, meant the District of Columbia National Guard (DCNG) was not activated, staged, and prepared to quickly respond to an attack on the Capitol,"" the Senate report found.\n\nPelosi has repeatedly denied GOP allegations that she or her office prevented the National Guard from deploying, or otherwise ignored threats of violence leading up to the riot.\n\nThe Democrat-led Jan. 6 select committee is expected release its final report on the Capitol riot Thursday. Seven Democrats and the two anti-Trump Republicans on the committee, Reps.

""In a staggering betrayal of his oath, Donald Trump attempted a plan that led to an attack on a pillar of our democracy.""\n\nThe panel argued during the committee\'s final meeting that Trump\'s conduct before and after Jan. 6 was ""unlawful.""

They had just come from a rally with Trump, and they were acting on the big lie of Trump that the presidential election was rife with fraud and stolen for Biden.\n\nTrump resisted pleas from his inner circle to help stop the riot once it started. He was reportedly enjoying the footage and did not want to tweet a message urging his supporters to stop and remain peaceful. He was also less concerned about the attack than he was about getting the election results overturned in a call with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\nTrump ended the day with a tweet that repeated his big lie about the election and sympathized with “great patriots.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!” he tweeted that day.\n\nMeanwhile, Capitol Police evacuated Pelosi on the day of the riot because her life was at risk. Federal officials arrested a man who broke into her office, rifled through papers and took pictures of himself with his feet on a desk.\n\nRepublicans have long tried to blame Pelosi for the pro-Trump Capitol riot, centered on inaccurate claims that she was personally responsible for the failure in security on Jan. 6.\n\nDemocracy In The Balance\n\nDon't let this be the end of the free press.

Pelosi also has no authority to call up the National Guard.\n\nPelosi pushed for the creation of a bipartisan commission to study the Jan. 6 attack, including the security failures of that day.

Startled, Pelosi asked the woman to repeat what she said.\n\n“Do you believe this?” Pelosi said in disbelief to another Democratic leader, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.\n\nIt was around 2:45 p.m. and the violent cacophony had already disrupted the planned certification of the 2020 presidential election results. It would be hours before the building was secure.\n\nAt one point, Pelosi said of President Donald Trump, “I’m gonna punch him out.”\n\nNever-before-seen video footage played Thursday by the House Jan. 6 committee, and later on CNN, showed Pelosi and other leaders, including Republican allies of Trump, responding anxiously — and angrily — to the insurrection.\n\nThe recordings offer a rare glimpse into the real-time reactions of the most powerful members of Congress as they scrambled to drum up support from all parts of the government, including from agencies seemingly ill prepared for the chaos, and vented anger over a president whose conduct they felt had endangered their lives.\n\nIn the videos, Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer negotiate with governors and defense officials to try to get the National Guard to the Capitol as police were being brutally beaten outside the building.\n\nThe deployment of the Guard was delayed for hours as Trump stood by and did little to stop the violence of his supporters.\n\nThe footage, recorded by Pelosi’s daughter, Alexandra, a documentary filmmaker, was shown during the committee’s 10th hearing as an illustration of the president’s inaction in the face of grave danger posed by the rioters to the lawmakers forced into hiding inside.\n\n“As the president watched the bloody attack unfold on Fox News from his dining room, members of Congress and other government officials stepped into the gigantic leadership void created by the president’s chilling and steady passivity that day,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a committee member.\n\nThe concerns were not theoretical. Around 3 p.m., as a Trump loyalist outside Pelosi’s office pointed her finger and shouted, “We’re coming in if you don’t bring her out,” the speaker was huddled somewhere else in a room with Schumer, who said, “I’m gonna call up the effin’ secretary of DoD.”\n\nAnd so he did, telling acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller on speakerphone that there were senators still in hideaway spaces and imploring him to send in the Maryland National Guard. Pelosi chimed in that she was going to call the mayor of Washington, D.C., for help as well.\n\nAs the violence persisted outside — “Officer down, get him up,” a voice could be heard bellowing in one clip shown by the committee — the leaders kept making calls inside. One went to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam about the possibility of help from the Virginia National Guard, with Pelosi narrating the events based on what she saw from television news footage.\n\nAn angrier call followed with Jeffrey Rosen, the then-acting attorney general. Days earlier, and unbeknownst at the time to Congress or to the public, Rosen and colleagues had fended off a slapdash attempt by Trump to replace him with a subordinate eager to challenge the election results.\n\nOn that day, though, Schumer and Pelosi sat shoulder-to-shoulder on the couch and laid bare their frustrations with the country’s top law enforcement official.\n\n“They’re breaking the law in many different ways,” Pelosi said. “And quite frankly, much of it at the instigation of the president of the United States.”\n\nSchumer weighed in too, shaking his head to the side for emphasis: “Yeah, why don’t you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility? A public statement they should all leave.”\n\nIn a clip that aired later on CNN, Pelosi was told that the Secret Service had dissuaded Trump from going to the Capitol.\n\n“If he comes, I’m gonna punch him out,” Pelosi responded. “I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m gonna punch him out. And I’m gonna go to jail, and I’m gonna be happy.”\n\nIt wasn’t until the evening that the Capitol would be cleared and work would resume. The news that Congress would be able to reconvene to finish its work in certifying the election results was delivered to the congressional leaders not by Trump but by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nAfter a very bad day, Schumer had two words: “Good news.”\n\n____\n\nFollow Eric Tucker at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/politics/security-failures-january-6-committee-blue-team/index.html', 'Headline': 'January 6 committee probes security failures as GOP counter ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Davis recently wrote to Pelosi to say his team had reviewed Capitol Hill security footage in the lead-up to January 6, 2021, and found no evidence of Republican lawmakers organizing ...', 'Full_text': 'More than 80 officials from law enforcement and federal agencies have testified to the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, including members of the Secret Service, in what investigators believe will be the most extensive review yet of security failures that led to the US Capitol breach.\n\nThe House select committee’s so-called “blue team” is focused on understanding the threats leading up to attack, how intelligence was shared among law enforcement and their preparations. In addition to depositions, the team has thousands of documents from more than a dozen agencies that other security reviews didn’t have, two committee aides tell CNN.\n\nWhile much of what the Democrat-led committee has made public so far has centered around the plotting by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election, aides and lawmakers say this behind-the-scenes review might lead to the bulk of their legislative recommendations and have the most lasting impact.\n\n“We really need to bear down on those things that we think need to be done from strengthening the windows, so they’re unbreakable, all the way up to potential reforms of the electoral count act and protection of the right to vote,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat on the committee. “We need to spend some real time talking about the policy recommendations and dimension of this.”\n\nAt the same time, Republicans have launched their own investigation into security lapses on January 6, 2021, and plan to release recommendations. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and GOP lawmakers involved in the effort have made clear they will focus, at least in part, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s role.\n\n“The reports that come out of the select committee are based upon anything that’s anti-President Trump,” said Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican who has used his position as the ranking member on the House Administration Committee to look into security issues.\n\nThe competing investigations underscore that January 6 remains a polarizing issue – turning even typically nonpartisan issues like security into partisan flash points – and that questions remain about how breakdowns happened and what improvements can be made to ensure such an attack never happens again.\n\nSecurity lapses scrutinized\n\nOver the past year, several reviews have examined various aspects of law enforcement failures, but some ran into challenges collecting information and none has been able to fully assess the federal, local and congressional response as a whole.\n\nFor example, congressional aides who worked on a Senate report released in June said that federal law enforcement agencies didn’t provide all of the information investigators requested. And the Capitol Police inspector general produced several reports but noted investigators spoke to about 35 officers, despite efforts to interview dozens more.\n\nThe inspectors general from the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security also plan to produce reports on their findings.\n\nThe House select committee’s blue team review is much broader than previous ones, aides say.\n\n“There’s a tremendous amount of more information that we have, that the Senate report did not have or any of the IG reports do not have in terms of the amount of interviews we’ve conducted,” one of the aides told CNN.\n\nThe committee’s sweeping probe includes several investigative teams, each with their own color designation. The green team, for example, is tasked with tracking money, including the funding behind the pro-Trump rallies that preceded the attack. In all, they have interviewed more than 750 people and subpoenaed thousands of records.\n\nIn contrast to the work of other teams, some of whom have had to confront recalcitrant witnesses and lawsuits seeking to block their subpoenas, the aide said witnesses for the blue team have been cooperative – and largely content to stay out of the public eye.\n\n“I don’t have folks storming out of my (depositions) and then going to the press,” the aide said.\n\n“It’s just it’s people who are genuinely concerned about what happened and want to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”\n\nAides say the witnesses have included current and former law enforcement officials, from first responders to high-ranking officers, and from the Secret Service, which has publicly revealed little about their operations that day.\n\nThe team expects to propose legislative fixes as well as administrative changes related to law enforcement and physical security at the Capitol.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a member of the committee, told CNN those proposals could address streamlining the process by which the Capitol Police chief gets approval to call on the National Guard, which led to issues on January 6, and how intelligence-gathering and information-sharing happens across various agencies. As chair of the House Administration Committee, which oversees Capitol Police, Lofgren has already spearheaded efforts to improve Capitol security.\n\n“Along with the entire investigation, we want to know everything that led up to and on the day of the 6th,” Lofgren said. “Now, part of that obviously is the law enforcement preparation for January 6, how they responded to the riot as it was happening, the shortcomings, and what recommendations we want to improve the situation in the future.”\n\nGOP investigation\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, McCarthy pledged last year that Republicans would pursue their own “investigation of the facts” after Pelosi rejected his picks to sit on the House Select Committee. Since then, two of the three Republicans vetoed by Pelosi have quietly undertaken the task.\n\nDavis and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana have teamed up to informally investigate security failures. No Republican member can subpoena witness testimony or documents without the help of Democrats, so any information they have collected has been through voluntary cooperation.\n\nDavis declined to specify who he and his fellow Republicans have interviewed or what documents they’ve collected but noted several whistleblowers have come forward through a website his committee launched in the months following the riot. Davis said he doesn’t have faith the House select committee will dig deeply enough.\n\n“I don’t think enough focus is going to be placed upon the failures of the security apparatus pre-January 6 that needs to be investigated,” Davis said, recalling that he got a security briefing from Capitol Police on January 5 in his office. “There was nothing in that briefing that would have led me to believe that I would have witnessed what I saw on January 6.”\n\nTwo sources close to the GOP investigation say they have interviewed dozens of witnesses, including rank-and-file law enforcement and top brass. Their report may be timed to coincide with the House Select Committee’s public hearings, the sources said – illustrating that they see their investigative effort as a counterweight to the committee’s work.\n\nDavis recently wrote to Pelosi to say his team had reviewed Capitol Hill security footage in the lead-up to January 6, 2021, and found no evidence of Republican lawmakers organizing “reconnaissance” tours as has been previously suggested by certain Democratic members.\n\nLofgren said Republicans are politicizing the issue of Capitol Hill security and discredited the GOP notion that Pelosi is somehow responsible for any breakdowns.\n\n“It’s obviously B.S., and it’s totally motivated by their effort to turn everything into a political game,” Lofgren said.'}}",87.9,2

Policy. Every few days in the United States, we mourn a new mass shooting. Daily acts of gun violence — including community violence, domestic violence, suicide, and accidental shootings — may not always make the evening news, but they too cut lives short and leave survivors and their communities with long-lasting physical and mental wounds. We cannot accept these facts as the enduring reality of life in America. Instead, we must together insist that we have had enough, and that we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation.\n\nIt is the policy of my Administration that executive departments and agencies (agencies) will pursue every legally available and appropriate action to reduce gun violence. Through this whole-of-government approach, my Administration has made historic progress to save lives. My Administration has taken action to keep guns out of dangerous hands and especially dangerous weapons off of our streets; hold gun traffickers and rogue gun dealers accountable; fund accountable, effective community policing; and invest in community violence interventions and prevention strategies.\n\nLast year, I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (the “Act”), the most significant bipartisan gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. The Act provides communities with new tools to combat gun violence, including enhanced gun background checks for individuals under age 21, funding for extreme risk protection orders and other crisis interventions, and increased mental health resources to help children impacted by gun violence heal from the resulting grief and trauma.\n\nI continue to call on the Congress to take additional action to reduce gun violence, including by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring background checks for all gun sales, requiring safe storage of firearms, funding my comprehensive Safer America Plan, and expanding community violence intervention and prevention strategies. In the meantime, my Administration will continue to do all that we can, within existing authority, to make our communities safer.\n\nSec. 2. Implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall each submit a report to the President within 60 days of the date of this order describing what actions their respective agencies have taken to implement the Act, data and analysis regarding the use and early effects of the Act, and additional steps their respective agencies will take to maximize the benefits of the Act. These reports shall include a plan for increasing public awareness and use of resources made available by the Act.\n\nSec. 3. Additional Agency Actions to Reduce Gun Violence. (a) The Attorney General shall develop and implement a plan to:\n\n(i) clarify the definition of who is engaged in the business of dealing in firearms, and thus required to become Federal firearms licensees (FFLs), in order to increase compliance with the Federal background check requirement for firearm sales, including by considering a rulemaking, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law;\n\n(ii) prevent former FFLs whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered from continuing to engage in the business of dealing in firearms;\n\n(iii) publicly release, to the fullest extent permissible by law, inspection reports of FFL dealers cited for violations of the law; and\n\n(iv) support efforts to modernize and make permanent the Undetectable Firearms Act (18 U.S.C. 922(p)).\n\n(b) The Secretary of Defense; the Attorney General; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; the Secretary of Education; and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall expand existing Federal campaigns and other efforts to promote safe storage of firearms.\n\n(c) The Secretary of Defense; the Attorney General; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; and the Secretary of Education shall undertake efforts to encourage effective use of extreme risk protection orders (“red flag” laws), partnering with law enforcement, health care providers, educators, and other community leaders.\n\n(d) The Attorney General; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; the Secretary of Education; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall develop a proposal for the President, and submit it no later than September 15, 2023, on how the Federal Government can better support the recovery, mental health, and other needs of survivors of gun violence, families of victims and survivors of gun violence, first responders to incidents of gun violence, and communities affected by gun violence. The proposal should draw on existing evidence, where available, and take into account how to address needs in both the immediate aftermath of mass shootings and in the years following such events. The proposal should recommend any additional executive branch coordination and additional resources or authorities from the Congress needed to implement the proposal, as well as how agencies will assess the outcomes for the activities implemented.\n\n(e) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop and implement principles to further firearm and public safety practices through the Department of Defense’s acquisition of firearms, consistent with applicable law.\n\n(f) The heads of Federal law enforcement agencies shall, as soon as practicable, but no later than 180 days from the date of this order, ensure that their respective law enforcement components issue National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) submission and utilization policies with requirements that are equivalent to, or exceed, the requirements of the policy issued by the Department of Justice on December 12, 2022, to ensure the prompt entry of ballistics data recovered in connection with criminal investigations into NIBIN. In consultation with the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense policies may be tailored to address specific operational considerations.\n\n(g) The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Justice, shall work to reduce the loss or theft of firearms during shipment between FFLs and to improve reporting of such losses or thefts, including by engaging with carriers and shippers.\n\n(h) The Federal Trade Commission is encouraged to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers market firearms to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.\n\nSec. 4. Definitions. For purposes of this order, the term “Federal law enforcement agency” means an organizational unit or subunit of the executive branch that employs officers who are authorized to make arrests and carry firearms, and that is responsible for the prevention, detection, and investigation of crime or the apprehension of alleged offenders. The term “heads of Federal law enforcement agencies” means the heads of those units or subunits.\n\nSec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nJOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nraila.org/articles/20230315/bidens-executive-order-targeting-gun-ownership', 'Headline': 'Biden’s Executive Order Targeting Gun Ownership - NRA-ILA', 'Snippet': 'The good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done.', 'Full_text': 'On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nMedia and gun control groups that beforehand had been salivating over the idea that the measure would impose “universal background checks” for firearm transfers had to content themselves with a vague directive for Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop a “plan” to move in that direction.\n\nAnd while the order’s other provisions were similarly vague and insubstantial, there is no doubt what it all adds up to: antagonism toward gun ownership is now the official policy of the U.S. government’s Executive Branch.\n\nThe good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done. Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them.

The Executive Order will also keep more guns out of dangerous hands by increasing the effective use of “red flag” laws, strengthen efforts to hold the gun industry accountable, and accelerate law enforcement efforts to identify and apprehend the shooters menacing our communities. President Biden is also encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors.\n\nPresident Biden is traveling to Monterey Park to grieve with the families and community impacted by the mass shooting that claimed 11 lives and injured nine others in January. Monterey Park is part of a growing list of communities all across the country that are forever changed due to gun violence—not only mass shootings, but also daily acts of gun violence that may not make national headlines.\n\nLast year, President Biden signed into the law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun violence reduction legislation enacted in nearly 30 years. When celebrating the Act’s passage, he called on Congress to seize the bipartisan momentum and advance additional commonsense steps to reduce gun violence. Again and again, he has called for Congress to act, including by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring background checks for all gun sales, requiring safe storage of firearms, closing the dating violence restraining order loophole, and repealing gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.\n\nAs he continues to call on Congress to act, President Biden will do everything he can to reduce gun violence and save lives. That is why, over the past two years, President Biden has taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other president at this point in their presidency.\n\nThe President’s new Executive Order to reduce gun violence includes the following additional actions, all of which fall within existing executive authority and outside of the right protected by the Second Amendment:\n\nKeeping guns out of dangerous hands\n\nThe Executive Order directs the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nIncrease the number of background checks by ensuring that all background checks required by law are conducted before firearm purchases, moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation. A large majority of Americans support background checks and agree it’s common sense to check whether someone is a felon or domestic abuser before allowing them to buy a gun. The President will continue to call on Congress to pass universal background check legislation. In the meantime, he is directing the Attorney General to do everything he can to ensure that firearms sellers who do not realize they are required to run background checks under existing law, or who are willfully violating existing law, become compliant with background check requirements. Specifically, the President is directing the Attorney General to move the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation by clarifying, as appropriate, the statutory definition of who is “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms, as updated by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This move would mean fewer guns will be sold without background checks, and therefore fewer guns will end up in the hands of felons and domestic abusers. The President is also directing the Attorney General to develop and implement a plan to prevent former federally licensed firearms dealers, whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered, from continuing to engage in the business of dealing in firearms.\n\nImprove public awareness and increase appropriate use of extreme risk protection (“red flag”) orders and safe storage of firearms. 19 states and the District of Columbia have enacted red flag laws, allowing trusted community members to petition a court to determine whether an individual is dangerous, and then to temporarily remove an individual’s access to firearms. However, these laws are only effective if the public knows when and how to use red flag orders. President Biden is directing members of his Cabinet to encourage effective use of extreme risk protection orders, including by partnering with law enforcement, health care providers, educators, and other community leaders. In addition, President Biden is directing members of his Cabinet to expand existing federal campaigns and other efforts to promote safe storage of firearms.\n\nAddress the loss or theft of firearms during shipping. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) data indicates an over 250% increase in the number of firearms reported as lost or stolen during shipment between federally licensed firearms dealers, from roughly 1,700 in 2018 to more than 6,100 in 2022. President Biden is directing the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Justice, to work to reduce the loss or theft of firearms during shipment and to improve reporting of such losses or thefts, including by engaging with carriers and shippers.\n\nHolding the gun industry accountable\n\nThe Executive Order directs the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nProvide the public and policymakers with more information regarding federally licensed firearms dealers who are violating the law. Gun dealers violating federal law put us all at risk by increasing the likelihood that firearms will fall into dangerous hands. The President is directing the Attorney General to publicly release, to the fullest extent permissible by law, ATF records from the inspection of firearms dealers cited for violation of federal firearm laws. This information will empower the public and policymakers to better understand the problem, and then improve our laws to hold rogue gun dealers accountable.\n\nUse the Department of Defense’s acquisition of firearms to further firearm and public safety practices. The Department of Defense buys a large number of firearms and other weapons to protect and serve our country. The President is directing the Secretary of Defense to develop and implement principles to further firearm and public safety practices through Department of Defense acquisition of firearms, consistent with applicable law.\n\nPresident Biden is also encouraging the independent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers market firearms to all civilians, including through the use of military imagery.\n\nAdditional steps to make our communities safer and support communities impacted by gun violence\n\nThe Executive Order will direct the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nHelp catch shooters by accelerating federal law enforcement’s reporting of ballistics data. The National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) allows federal, state, and local law enforcement to match fired cartridge casings to the guns from which they were fired, making it easier for law enforcement to connect multiple crime scenes and catch shooters. In order to maximize NIBIN’s effectiveness, federal, state, and local law enforcement all have an important role to play in ensuring timely submission of ballistics data to NIBIN. Today, the President is directing all federal law enforcement agencies to issue rigorous requirements regarding NIBIN data submission and use of this tool.\n\nAccelerate and intensify implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). BSCA is the most significant gun safety legislative accomplishment in nearly 30 years, and the Biden-Harris Administration is treating it as such by making the most of every opportunity it provides to reduce gun violence. President Biden is directing each agency responsible for the law’s implementation to send a report to him, within 60 days, on progress toward full implementation of BSCA and additional steps they will take to maximize the benefits of the law, including by increasing public awareness and use of the resources made available by BSCA.\n\nImprove federal support for gun violence survivors, victims and survivors’ families, first responders to gun violence, and communities affected by gun violence. When a hurricane overwhelms a community, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coordinates federal, state, local, and non-profit organizations in order to assess and meet community needs. However, when a mass shooting overwhelms a community, no coordinated U.S. government mechanism exists to meet short- and long-term needs, such as mental health care for grief and trauma, financial assistance (for example, when a family loses the sole breadwinner or when a small business is shut down due to a lengthy shooting investigation), and food (for example, when the Buffalo shooting closed down the only grocery store in the neighborhood). The President is directing members of his Cabinet to develop a proposal for how the federal government can better support communities after a mass shooting, and identify what additional resources or authorities the executive branch would need from Congress to implement this proposal.\n\nAdvance congressional efforts to prevent the proliferation of firearms undetectable by metal detectors. In recent years, we’ve seen the rise of technology that allows guns to be made with polymers and other materials that are increasingly capable of avoiding detection by metal detectors. President Biden is directing the Attorney General to help Congress modernize and make permanent the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988, which is currently set to expire in December 2023.\n\n###\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-another-life-saving-step-to-keep-guns-out-of-dangerous-hands/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Biden- - The White House', 'Snippet': 'Since 1994, federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon. These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more than three million felons, convicted domestic abusers, and other dangerous individuals.', 'Full_text': 'In March, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the Attorney General to move as close to universal background checks as possible within existing law. Today, as a result of the Executive Order and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the Department of Justice is taking life-saving action to reduce the number of guns sold without background checks and keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\n\nWhy the Biden-Harris Administration is Taking Action\n\nSince 1994, federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon. These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more than three million felons, convicted domestic abusers, and other dangerous individuals. However, despite the law, individuals who should be licensed dealers have refused to obtain a license, skirting the background check requirement.\n\nLast year, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law bipartisan legislation to help address this dangerous problem by modifying the definition of who has to become a federally licensed firearms dealer. Members of Congress—both Democrats and Republicans—made clear that they intended for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to better protect the American people from gun violence by clarifying when someone is supposed to become a licensed firearms dealer.\n\nNew Action to Keep Guns Out of Dangerous Hands\n\nToday, the Justice Department has announced a proposed rule to specify what exactly the new definition in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act means on the ground. If finalized, this proposed rule would mean the following for people who are not selling guns in order to make money: If you have a gun you no longer need, and you want to sell it to your family member, you do not need a license to sell it. If you buy and sell curios or relics or “collectible” personal firearms as a hobby, again, you do not need a license. But, if you are offering a firearm for sale to make money, and telling a customer that you can purchase and sell him additional firearms, you would presumptively need a license—and need to run background checks. The same is true if you repetitively offer for resale firearms within 30 days of when you purchased them. The proposed rule includes a number of other situations where, in civil and administrative proceedings and absent reliable evidence to the contrary, it will be presumed that you need a license.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed rule, if finalized, would clarify that an individual would be presumed to be “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms—and therefore be required to become a licensed firearms dealer and run background checks—if they meet certain conditions. For example, under the proposed rule, a person would be presumed to be required to become a licensed dealer and run background checks if they meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\nOffer for sale any number of firearms and also represents to potential buyers that they are willing and able to purchase and sell them additional firearms;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms within 30 days after they were purchased;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms that are like new in their original packaging;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale multiple firearms of the same make and model; or\n\nAs a formerly federally-licensed firearms dealer, sell firearms that were in the business inventory and not transferred to a personal collection at least a year before the sale, addressing the so-called “fire sale loophole.”\n\nThe proposed rule would also clarify that, for civil or administrative actions, an individual would be presumed to have the intent to “predominantly earn a profit”—one of the elements of engaging in the business of dealing firearms—if the person engages in activities such as:\n\nCreating a website or making business cards to advertise or market a firearms business;\n\nMaintaining records to document and track profits and losses from firearms purchases or sales; or\n\nPurchasing business insurance or renting space at a gun show.\n\nThe proposed rule would make clear that there is no “gun show loophole” or “internet loophole” in federal law. Dealers who engage in the business of selling guns are required to obtain a license and run background checks no matter where they engage in the business of buying and selling firearms. That include at gun shows and over the Internet.\n\nThe proposed rule is now open for public comment. The Department of Justice will consider the comments it receives in deciding on a final rule.\n\nContinuing to Call on Congress to Act\n\nThis rule is a significant step toward reducing the percentage of firearms sold for profit without background checks. It builds on previous Biden-Harris Administration actions to save lives and combat the epidemic of gun violence.\n\nHowever, to fully address this problem, Congress must act. The President continues to call on Congress to enact universal background checks legislation, as well as other commonsense legislation to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of guns, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. These are life-saving measures that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support to protect our Country from the threat of gun violence.\n\n###'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64939930', 'Headline': 'Gun control: Biden issues executive order on background checks', 'Snippet': 'US President Joe Biden has issued an executive order that aims to increase the number of background checks conducted before firearm sales.

Lives will be saved,” he said in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. Citing the families of shooting victims he has met, the president said, “Their message to us was, ‘Do something.’ How many times did we hear that? ‘Just do something. For God’s sake, just do something.’ Today we did.”\n\nThe House gave final approval Friday, following Senate passage Thursday, and Biden acted just before leaving Washington for two summits in Europe.\n\n“Today we say, ‘More than enough,’” Biden said. “It’s time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nWATCH: What the nation’s largest teachers union thinks about gun violence in schools\n\nThe legislation will toughen background checks for the youngest gun buyers, keep firearms from more domestic violence offenders and help states put in place red flag laws that make it easier for authorities to take weapons from people adjudged to be dangerous.\n\nThe president called it “a historic achievement.”\n\nMost of its $13 billion cost will help bolster mental health programs and aid schools, which have been targeted in Newtown, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida, and elsewhere in mass shootings.\n\nBiden said the compromise hammered out by a bipartisan group of senators from both parties “doesn’t do everything I want” but “it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives.”\n\n“I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day,” said the president, who was joined by his wife, Jill, a teacher, for the signing.\n\nAfter sitting to sign the bill, Biden sat reflectively for a moment, then murmured, “God willing, this is gonna save a lot of lives.”\n\nHe also said they will host an event on July 11 for lawmakers and families affected by gun violence. The president spoke of families “who lost their souls to an epidemic of gun violence. They lost their child, their husband, their wife. Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma that they had to live through.”\n\nBiden signed the measure two days after the Supreme Court’s ruling Thursday striking down a New York law that restricted peoples’ ability to carry concealed weapons. And Saturday’s ceremony came less than 24 hours after the high court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision, which had legalized abortion nationwide for nearly five decades.\n\n“Yesterday, I spoke about the Supreme Court’s shocking decision striking down Roe v. Wade,” Biden said. “Jill and I know how painful and devastating the decision is for so many Americans. I mean so many Americans.”\n\nHe noted that the abortion ruling leaves enforcement up to the states, some of which have already moved to ban abortion or will soon do so. Biden said his administration will “focus on how they administer it and whether or not they violate other laws, like deciding to not allow people to cross state lines to get health services.”\n\nAsked by reporters about whether the Supreme Court was broken, Biden said, “I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.” He walked away without answering more questions, noting, ” “I have a helicopter waiting for me to take off.”\n\nWhile the new gun law does not include tougher restrictions long championed by Democrats, such as a ban on assault-style weapons and background checks for all firearm transactions, it is the most impactful gun violence measure produced by Congress since enactment a long-expired assault weapons ban in 1993.\n\nEnough congressional Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the steps after recent rampages in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas. It took weeks of closed-door talks but senators emerged with a compromise.\n\nBiden signed the bill just before departing Washington for a summit of the Group of Seven leading economic powers — the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — in Germany.

Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition.

But the proposal sets no required staffing level for licensed practical nurses, who play a critical caregiving role at most facilities.\n\nSome organizations and individuals say that omission could cause facilities trying to lower their costs to simply replace LPNs with less-expensive nursing aides; and then staff RNs only to the required minimum level. “I don’t see any reason that they would do anything else,” said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition.\n\n“Each facility would save $14 per hour,” since nursing aides cost roughly $21 per hour, compared with an estimated $35 per hour for an LPN, according to a comment letter from more than 60 aging services experts.\n\nUnder that scenario, the potential loss of LPNs—who have a higher training level than nursing aides—would lower the “skill mix” of the direct care staff and hurt the quality of care, Mollot said. It could also force RNs to assume more LPN duties, “potentially straining their already considerable workload,” said a comment letter on the proposal from the American Nurses Association, which represents registered nurses and advance practice nurses.\n\nWhile states determine what tasks LPNs are licensed to perform, they typically administer medications and treatments that nursing aides are either not trained or not allowed to provide, according to the National Association of Social Workers. Additionally, LPNs apply bandages and dressings, monitor IVs, and take resident vital signs, like blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate.\n\nNursing aides, the primary caregivers in nursing homes, assist residents with daily living activities like dressing, eating, and toileting.\n\nRegistered nurses supervise LPNs and nursing aides. They also provide more complex direct care than LPNs, collaborate with doctors, rehab staff, social workers, and others about care goals and interventions, and implement regulatory requirements, according to the NASW.\n\nThe LPN issue is just one of several criticisms the nursing home staffing rule has received. Industry has called it costly and unworkable, while Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) has threatened legislation to stop implementation of the rule. Advocates for nursing home residents say the proposal doesn’t go far enough and isn’t tough enough to improve the quality of care.\n\nHealth Outcomes\n\nIn justifying its policy proposal, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services argued that better health outcomes were only associated with increased staffing for RNs and nursing aides—not LPNs.\n\nIn fact, a CMS-commissioned study in 2022 showed no association “at any level” between LPN staffing and “safe and quality care.” And the agency cited concerns that LPNs could perform tasks “outside their scope of practice” without sufficient RN supervision. “This is concerning,” because LPNs “require an RN or a physician’s supervision to practice,” the CMS proposal said.\n\nIn a joint comment letter to CMS, the National Association of Licensed Practical Nurses joined the American Health Care Association, LeadingAge, and other groups in calling for the proposed rule to be rescinded. But if the rule is finalized, they want LPNs to count—just like RNs—toward any mandatory staffing requirement for nurses.\n\n“These are integral and valued members of our nursing homes, and they should be treated as such,” the letter said. The National Association of Licensed Practical Nurses did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nOther groups urging LPNs to count toward a staffing requirement include the National Association of Social Workers, Medicaid Health Plans of America, National Nurses United, the American Association of Post-Acute Care Nursing, and Advion, which represents ancillary care providers in the long term and senior care markets.\n\nMisgivings\n\nTheir misgivings are not new. In a 2016 nursing home final rule that implemented several industry reforms, the Obama administration questioned whether staffing requirements “could result in unintended consequences, such as staffing to the minimum, input substitution (hiring for one position by eliminating another), and task diversion (assigning non-standard tasks to a position).”\n\nAs millions of aging baby boomers with chronic conditions hit their senior years, the need for LPNs in residential care facilities is expected to grow. More than 54,000 annual job openings for LPNs are projected from 2022 to 2032, according to federal estimates.\n\nSince some hospitals no longer use LPNs for acute care positions, long-term care facilities have become a growing employment source for LPNs, said Zina Gontscharow, a senior policy adviser for the American Nurses Association. Currently, licensed practical nurses, also known as licensed vocational nurses, or LVNs, make up 13%, or more than 186,000, of the nation’s 1.4 million-plus nursing home workforce.\n\n“We are hearing more and more that the LPN is an increasingly important and integral part of the care team” in the long-term care facilities, Gontscharow said.\n\nThe proposed rule would require a minimum overall nurse staffing level of 3.0 “hours per resident per day,” or “3.0 HPRD.” That breaks down to a required 2.45 HPRD for nursing aides, and 0.55 HPRD for registered nurses. HPRD is the “total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents,” according to the CMS.\n\nThe proposal would also require nursing homes to have a registered nurse on site at all times.\n\nPrecedent for Concern\n\nMollot said there’s precedent for the concern that nursing homes would cut LPNs if the final CMS rule contained no staffing requirement for the position.\n\nHe said nursing homes cut thousands of occupational and physical therapists in 2020 just before Medicare implemented a new payment system that based reimbursements more on a patient’s medical needs, rather than the amount of therapy hours provided.\n\nThe job cuts occurred “even though CMS maintained they still had to perform the same amount of services based on resident needs,” Mollot said.\n\nThe industry would counter that some job losses were a byproduct of the new payment system’s primary intent: to reduce incentives to provide unnecessary therapy services. It would also argue that resident health outcomes have not declined under the new system.\n\nOther positions not included in the staffing requirement, like dietitians and social workers, could also be at risk in facilities that struggle financially to meet the proposed staffing requirements, according to Advion.\n\nThe American Association of Post-Acute Care Nursing, which represents nearly 19,000 nurses working in long-term care facilities, wants the CMS to conduct more research on the relationship between RN and LPN staffing ratios, how state laws influence the LPN scope of practice, and how much RN oversight LPNs need.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/us/federal-government-dictate-staffing-levels-nursing-homes-first-time-ever-according-biden-admin', 'Headline': 'Federal government will dictate staffing levels at nursing homes for ...', 'Snippet': 'The Biden administration announced on Sept. 1, 2023, that the federal government will dictate staffing levels at nursing homes for the first time ever.

""When facilities are understaffed, residents suffer.""\n\nThe proposed rules, which now enter a public comment period and would take years more to fully take effect, call for staffing equivalent to 3 hours per resident per day, just over half an hour of it coming from registered nurses. The rules also call for facilities to have an RN on staff 24 hours a day, every day.\n\nThe average U.S. nursing home already has overall caregiver staffing of about 3.6 hours per resident per day, according to government reports, including RN staffing just above the half-hour mark.\n\nNEW JERSEY NURSING HOME SHOOTING LEAVES 2 DEAD, POLICE SAY\n\nStill, the government insists a majority of the country’s roughly 15,000 nursing homes, which house some 1.2 million people, would have to add staff under the proposed rules.\n\nChiquita Brooks-LaSure, who heads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, called the move ""an important first step."" CMS oversees nursing homes.\n\nA senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement, said the Biden administration was open to revisiting the staffing threshold once implemented.\n\n""I would caution anyone who thinks that the status quo – in which there is no federal floor for nursing home staffing – is preferable to the standards we’re proposing,"" said Stacy Sanders, an aide to Beccera. ""This standard would raise staffing levels for more than 75% of nursing homes, bringing more nurse aides to the bedside and ensuring every nursing home has a registered nurse on site 24/7.""\n\nThe new thresholds are drastically lower than those that had long been eyed by advocates after a landmark 2001 CMS-funded study recommended an average of 4.1 hours of nursing care per resident daily.\n\nMost U.S. facilities don’t meet that threshold. Many advocates said even it was insufficient, not taking into account quality of life, simply determining the point at which residents could suffer potential harm.\n\nAfter the Democratic president elevated the issue in his State of the Union speech, advocates were initially elated, expecting the most significant change for residents since the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987. That changed after a copy of a new CMS-funded study on the subject was inadvertently posted this week, claiming there is ""no obvious plateau at which quality and safety are maximized.""\n\nAdvocates were bereft, saying they felt betrayed by administration officials they thought to be allies. As word of the proposal became public early Friday some were even more blistering.\n\nMOST SENIORS IN AMERICA CAN’T AFFORD NURSING HOMES OR ASSISTED LIVING, STUDY FINDS\n\nRichard Mollot, who leads the Long Term Care Community Coalition, called it ""completely inadequate"" and a blown chance of ""a once-in-a-generation opportunity"" that ""flouts any evidence"" of what residents need and fails to make good on the heart of Biden’s promise. He begrudgingly acknowledged the 24/7 RN rule could bring small improvements to the worst facilities, but he otherwise was withering in his criticism.\n\nCalling the move ""heartbreaking"" and ""nauseating,"" he said it would do more harm than good, putting a government imprimatur on poorly staffed homes and imperiling wrongful-death lawsuits.\n\n""It is a tremendous dereliction of duty,"" he said. ""We are continuing to allow nursing homes to warehouse people and to rip the public off.""\n\nKatie Smith Sloan, the head LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit nursing homes, said it was meaningless to create a rule requiring facilities to hire additional staff when the industry was already in a workforce crisis and ""there are simply no people to hire.""\n\n""To say that we are disappointed that President Biden chose to move forward with the proposed staffing ratios despite clear evidence against them is an understatement,"" she said.\n\nCurrent law requires only that homes have ""sufficient"" staffing, but it leaves nearly all interpretation to states. Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have their own staffing regulations. Some are so low that advocates say they’re meaningless, and, across the board, enforcement is often toothless.\n\nThe problem has long been apparent to front-line nurse aides – the low-paid, overwhelmingly female and disproportionately minority backbone of facility staffs – and to residents themselves, whose call bells go unanswered, whose showers become less frequent and who lie hungry, awaiting help with meals.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which claimed more than 167,000 U.S. nursing home residents, brought the greatest attention to poor staffing in history.

When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.ideastream.org/health/2023-09-01/understaffed-nursing-homes-are-a-huge-problem-and-bidens-promised-fix-sabotaged', 'Headline': ""Understaffed nursing homes are a huge problem, and Biden's promised fix ..."", 'Snippet': ""The Biden administration last year promised to establish minimum staffing levels for the nation's roughly 15,000 nursing homes.

The proposed rule would require each resident get 33 minutes of care a day from a registered nurse. It also would mandate that at least one RN be working at a facility 24 hours a day. For nurse\'s aides, the care hours recommended are 2.45 hours per resident per day, a total below what was studied in the research referenced in this story. The comment period for the proposed rule goes until Nov. 6.\n\nThe Biden administration last year promised to establish minimum staffing levels for the nation\'s roughly 15,000 nursing homes. It was the centerpiece of an agenda to overhaul an industry the government said was rife with substandard care and failures to follow federal quality rules.\n\nBut a research study the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services commissioned to identify the appropriate level of staffing made no specific recommendations and analyzed only staffing levels lower than what the previous major federal evaluation had considered best, according to a copy of the study reviewed this week by KFF Health News. Instead, the new study said there was no single staffing level that would guarantee quality care, although the report estimated that higher staffing levels would lead to fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits, faster care, and fewer failures to provide care.\n\nPatient advocates said the report was the latest sign that the administration would fall short of its pledge to establish robust staffing levels to protect the 1.2 million Americans in skilled nursing facilities.\n\nResidents at risk\n\nAlready, the administration is six months behind its self-imposed deadline of February to propose new rules. Those proposals, which have not been released, were under evaluation from May until this week by the Office of Management and Budget. The study, dated June 2023, has not been formally released either, but a copy was posted on the CMS website. It was taken down shortly after KFF Health News published this article.\n\n""It\'s honestly heartbreaking,"" said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for nursing home patients in New York state. ""I just don\'t see how this doesn\'t ultimately put more residents at risk of neglect and abuse. Putting the government\'s imprimatur on a standard that is patently unsafe is going to make it much more difficult for surveyors to hold facilities accountable for the harm caused by understaffing nursing homes.""\n\nFor months, the nursing home industry has been lobbying strenuously against a uniform ratio of patients to nurses and aides. ""What is clear as you look across the country is every nursing home is unique and a one-size-fits-all approach does not work,"" said Holly Harmon, senior vice president of quality, regulatory, and clinical services at the American Health Care Association, an industry trade group.\n\nGrueling work, low pay\n\nNursing home groups have emphasized the widespread difficulty in finding workers willing to fill existing certified nursing assistant jobs, which are often grueling and pay less than what workers can make at retail stores. Homes say their licensed nurses are often drawn away by other jobs, such as better-paying hospital positions. ""The workforce challenges are real,"" said Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of LeadingAge, an association that represents nonprofit nursing homes.\n\nThe industry has also argued that if the government wants it to hire more workers it needs to increase the payments it makes through state Medicaid programs, which are the largest payor for nursing home care. Advocates and some researchers have argued that nursing homes, particularly for-profit ones, can afford to pay employees more and hire additional staff if they forsake some of the profits they give investors.\n\n""Certainly, facilities haven\'t put all the dollars back into direct care over the years,"" said David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. ""But for certain facilities, it\'s going to be a big lift to pay for"" higher staffing levels, he said in an interview last week.\n\nWidely anticipated study\n\nIn a written statement to KFF Health News, Jonathan Blum, CMS\' principal deputy administrator and chief operating officer, said the study had been posted in error.\n\n""CMS is committed to holding nursing homes accountable for protecting the health and safety of all residents, and adequate staffing is critical to this effort,"" he said. ""CMS\'s proposal is being developed using a rigorous process that draws on a wide range of source information, including extensive input from residents and their families, workers, administrators, experts, and other stakeholders. Our focus is on advancing implementable solutions that promote safe, quality care for residents.""\n\nBlum\'s statement called the study a ""draft,"" although nothing in the 478-page study indicated it was preliminary.\n\nThe study has been widely anticipated, both because of the central role the administration said it would play in its policy and because the last major CMS study, conducted in 2001, had concluded that nursing home care improves as staffing increases up to the level of about one worker for every six residents. The formal metric for that staffing level was 4.1 staff hours per resident per day, which is calculated by dividing the number of total hours worked by nurses and aides on duty daily by the number of residents present each day.\n\nCMS never adopted that staffing ratio and instead gave each nursing home discretion to determine a reasonable staffing level. Regulators rarely cite nursing homes for insufficient staffing, even though independent researchers have concluded low staffing is the root of many nursing home injuries. Too few nurse aides, for instance, often means immobile residents are not repositioned in bed, causing bedsores that can lead to infection. Low staffing also is often responsible for indignities residents face, such as being left in soiled bedsheets for hours.\n\n\'Sabotaged\'\n\nThe new research was conducted by Abt Associates, a regular contractor for CMS that also performed the 2001 study. But the report, in an implicit disagreement with its predecessor, concluded there was ""no obvious plateau at which quality and safety are maximized or \'cliff\' below which quality and safety steeply decline."" Abt referred questions about the study to CMS.\n\nThe study evaluated four minimum staffing levels, all of which were below the 4.1 daily staff hours that the prior study had identified as ideal. The highest was 3.88 daily staff hours. At that level, the study estimated 0.6% of residents would get delayed care and 0.002% would not get needed care. It also said that staffing level would result in 12,100 fewer hospitalizations of Medicare residents and 14,800 fewer emergency room visits. The report said three-quarters of nursing homes would need to add staff to meet that level and that it would cost $5.3 billion extra each year.\n\nThe lowest staffing level the report analyzed was 3.3 daily staffing hours. At that level, the report said, 3.3% of residents would get delayed care and 0.04% would not get needed care. That level would reduce hospitalizations of Medicare residents by 5,800 and lead to 4,500 fewer emergency room visits. More than half of nursing homes would have to increase staff levels to meet that ratio, the report said, and it would cost $1.5 billion more each year.\n\nCharlene Harrington, a professor emeritus of nursing at the University of California-San Francisco, said CMS ""sabotaged"" the push for sufficiently high staffing through the instructions it gave its contractor. ""Every threshold they looked at was below 4.1,"" she said. ""How can that possibly be a decent study? It\'s just unacceptable.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://freebeacon.com/author/stiles/biden-administration/biden-nursing-home/', 'Headline': 'Bad News for Biden: Nursing Home Patients Keep Dying After Wandering ...', 'Snippet': 'In a troublesome development for President Joe Biden, 81, the Washington Post on Sunday published an exclusive investigation detailing how nearly 100 assisted-living patients have ""died after ...', 'Full_text': 'In a troublesome development for President Joe Biden, 81, the Washington Post on Sunday published an exclusive investigation detailing how nearly 100 assisted-living patients have ""died after wandering away unnoticed"" since 2018.\n\nBiden has a long history of wandering away and nearly getting lost at public events.

You lie awake at night wondering: Will they receive the care and support they need? How can you be sure they’ll be safe? Are you doing the right thing?\n\nUnfortunately, too many Americans across the country know firsthand how hard it can be to find a nursing home that provides that peace of mind. A woman in Texas, who has changed nursing facilities three times in four years over concerns about care, wrote to me, “We keep looking for someplace that will fulfill the promises they make when you’re admitted.” A daughter in New York, whose mother is in a facility, wrote, “It keeps me up at night, when there’s half of what’s needed” to keep a parent safe.\n\nDespite nursing homes receiving nearly $100 billion annually from American taxpayers, too many facilities are understaffed, which can result in severe illness and even death for residents.\n\nThose vulnerabilities were exposed during the pandemic, when more than 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died from COVID-19. And in recent years, more private-equity firms have been buying up nursing homes and slashing key staff to cut costs and make bigger profits, endangering the safety of their residents in the process.\n\nIn my State of the Union address, I pledged to crack down on nursing homes that put the well-being of their residents at risk. Today, here’s how my administration is following through on this commitment to ensure that every nursing home is safe for every resident and that residents get the care they deserve.\n\nPresident Biden: I’m doing everything I can to reduce gun violence, but Congress must do more\n\nNew minimum staffing requirements are coming for nursing homes\n\nWe’re proposing minimum staffing requirements for every taxpayer-funded nursing home. Under our new proposed standards, every nursing facility would have to provide a registered nurse on site 24/7 and have enough nurses and nurse aides to provide routine bedside care, among other tasks. Research shows that these staffing levels will save lives, provide residents with a higher quality of life and prevent needless suffering.\n\nThink of it this way: We are working to make sure no nursing home can sacrifice the safety of its residents just to add some dollars to its bottom line. It’s telling that nonprofit nursing homes are three times as likely as for-profit facilities to already satisfy the minimum staffing standard we’re proposing today. Some corporate nursing home owners are taking taxpayer dollars while cutting corners on staffing so they can make big payouts to executives and shareholders. It’s wrong.\n\nWe’re also supporting the folks who are doing God’s work – the nursing staff who care for so many of our loved ones but who are overworked and under-resourced. Nursing home staff describe getting burned out when they have too many residents to care for in too little time. Many end up leaving the industry. Minimum staffing standards would help them stay in the jobs they love. And we’re doing our part.\n\nNursing home staff minimums: Biden wants to boost staffing at nursing homes, but feds rarely enforce existing rules\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is announcing a new $75 million investment, on top of hundreds of millions of dollars already committed, to recruit, train and retain nurses and other caregivers.\n\nThese announcements are the latest in my administration’s effort to make nursing homes safer and to make sure taxpayer dollars are well spent. We’ve increased transparency and accountability for nursing home owners, gone after fraud and abuse and more.\n\nWe also remain focused on supporting high quality care at home. That’s why in April, I signed an executive order to support caregivers, building on prior actions and investments in home and community-based care.\n\nAs a country, we’re delivering a clear message to the nursing home industry: no more padding profits on the backs of residents and nurses. If you tell families you’ll take care of their loved ones, then follow through.\n\nThat’s how we build a long-term care system where loved ones can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive the care they need in the setting of their choice and where there is a pipeline of health care workers into good-paying jobs – that include the free and fair choice to join a union.\n\nFor all you facing that most gut-wrenching of moments, you and your loved ones deserve nothing less than peace of mind and dignity.

The AFL-CIO and SEIU, which both represent nursing home workers, lauded the Biden administration\'s plans.\n\n""Nursing home workers and residents have suffered unspeakable consequences,"" SEIU International President Mary Kay Henry says in a statement. She calls the proposal ""bold reform"" that gives hope to the ""woman-of-color-powered nursing home workforce"" for better, safer working conditions ahead.\n\nThe specific proposals are:\n\nNursing homes should have at least one registered nurse working 24/7.\n\nEach patient should be guaranteed 33 minutes of a nurse\'s time each day.\n\nEvery resident should have about 2.5 hours of a certified nursing assistant\'s care every day.\n\nThere should be at least one certified nursing assistant for every 10 residents.\n\nThe modest-sounding measures, nonetheless, would require more than 75% of nursing homes in the U.S. to hire additional staff, according to the administration.\n\nAnd that\'s a big problem, nursing home industry representatives say.\n\n""There are simply no people to hire — especially nurses,"" says Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit nursing homes and other aging services providers. ""It\'s meaningless to mandate staffing levels that cannot be met.""\n\nIn a statement, Sloan says immigration reform is needed to grow the workforce, and her members need better reimbursement rates from Medicare and Medicaid. She predicted the mandates could close nonprofit nursing homes.

""The lack of standards and poor-quality care in too many of America\'s nursing homes is deadly,"" Nancy LeaMond, AARP\'s chief advocacy officer, says in a statement.

The President is committed to ensuring that all Americans, including older Americans and people with disabilities, live in a society that is accessible, inclusive, and equitable. To accomplish that goal, the Administration continues to be committed to home- and community-based services and ensuring that in no case should a health care facility be causing a patient harm. The President believes we must improve the quality of our nursing homes so that seniors, people with disabilities, and others living in nursing homes get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve. That’s why he is announcing a set of reforms—developed by and implemented through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—that will improve the safety and quality of nursing home care, hold nursing homes accountable for the care they provide, and make the quality of care and facility ownership more transparent so that potential residents and their loved ones can make informed decisions about care.\n\nTo do this, the reforms the President is announcing will ensure that:\n\nevery nursing home provides a sufficient number of staff who are adequately trained to provide high-quality care;\n\npoorly performing nursing homes are held accountable for improper and unsafe care and immediately improve their services or are cut off from taxpayer dollars; and\n\nthe public has better information about nursing home conditions so that they can find the best available options.\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted the tragic impact of substandard conditions at nursing homes, which are home to many of our most at-risk community members. More than 1.4 million people live in over 15,500 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes across the nation. In the past two years, more than 200,000 residents and staff in nursing homes have died from COVID-19—nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nDespite the tens of billions of federal taxpayer dollars flowing to nursing homes each year, too many continue to provide poor, sub-standard care that leads to avoidable resident harm. In fact, failure to comply with Federal guidelines at nursing homes is widespread. The Government Accountability Office found that, from 2013 to 2017, 82% of all inspected nursing homes had an infection prevention and control deficiency, including a lack of regular handwashing, that was identified through Medicare and Medicaid surveys.\n\nWithout decisive action now, these unacceptable conditions may get worse. Private equity firms have been buying up struggling nursing homes, and research shows that private equity-owned nursing homes tend to have significantly worse outcomes for residents. Private equity firms’ investment in nursing homes has ballooned from $5 billion in 2000 to more than $100 billion in 2018, with about 5% of all nursing homes now owned by private equity firms. Too often, the private equity model has put profits before people—a particularly dangerous model when it comes to the health and safety of vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities. Recent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes:\n\nA recent study found that residents in nursing homes acquired by private equity were 11.1% more likely to have a preventable emergency department visit and 8.7% more likely to experience a preventable hospitalization, when compared to residents of for-profit nursing homes not associated with private equity.\n\nOne working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities over a seventeen-year period found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. That suggests an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nAnother study found that private equity-backed nursing homes’ COVID-19 infection rate and death rate were 30% and 40% above statewide averages, respectively.\n\nResearch also suggests that, despite depriving residents of quality care, private equity-owned nursing homes actually led to an uptick in Medicare costs, too.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new steps by Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) through its Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to improve the quality and safety of nursing homes, to protect vulnerable residents and the health care heroes who care for them, and to crack down on bad actors. The Administration is committed to these urgent actions as first steps toward fulfilling a broader commitment to ensure taxpayer dollars go toward the safe, adequate, and respectful care seniors and people with disabilities deserve—not to the pockets of predatory owners and operators who seek to maximize their profits at the expense of vulnerable residents’ health and safety.\n\nEnsuring Taxpayer Dollars Support Nursing Homes That Provide Safe, Adequate, and Dignified Care\n\nCMS is launching four new initiatives to ensure that residents get the quality care they need—and that taxpayers pay for. These initiatives will help ensure adequate staffing, dignity and safety in their accommodations, and quality care.\n\nEstablish a Minimum Nursing Home Staffing Requirement. The adequacy of a nursing home’s staffing is the measure most closely linked to the quality of care residents receive. For example, a recent study of one state’s nursing facilities found that increasing registered nurse staffing by just 20 minutes per resident day was associated with 22% fewer confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-19 deaths. CMS intends to propose minimum standards for staffing adequacy that nursing homes must meet. CMS will conduct a new research study to determine the level and type of staffing needed to ensure safe and quality care and will issue proposed rules within one year. Establishing a minimum staffing level ensures that all nursing home residents are provided safe, quality care, and that workers have the support they need to provide high-quality care. Nursing homes will be held accountable if they fail to meet this standard.\n\nReduce Resident Room Crowding. Most nursing home residents prefer to have private rooms to protect their privacy and dignity, but shared rooms with one or more other residents remain the default option. These multi-occupancy rooms increase residents’ risk of contracting infectious diseases, including COVID-19. CMS will explore ways to accelerate phasing out rooms with three or more residents and to promote single-occupancy rooms.\n\nStrengthen the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Value-Based Purchasing (“VBP”) Program. The SNF-VBPprogram awards incentive funding to facilities based on quality performance. CMS has begun to measure and publish staff turnover and weekend staffing levels, metrics which closely align with the quality of care provided in a nursing home. CMS intends to propose new payment changes based on staffing adequacy, the resident experience, as well as how well facilities retain staff.\n\nReinforce Safeguards against Unnecessary Medications and Treatments. Thanks to CMS’ National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care in Nursing Homes, the nation has seen a dramatic decrease in the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes in recent years. However, inappropriate diagnoses and prescribing still occur at too many nursing homes. CMS will launch a new effort to identify problematic diagnoses and refocus efforts to continue to bring down the inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications.\n\nEnhancing Accountability and Oversight\n\nHolding nursing homes accountable for their performance requires a robust compliance program—a program that has adequate funding to perform inspections and that imposes meaningful penalties when deficiencies are found. Federal taxpayer dollars should not flow to nursing homes that are unsafe.\n\nAdequately Fund Inspection Activities. For over seven years, funding to conduct health and safety inspections has remained flat while the number of complaints about nursing homes has surged. To protect residents and crack down on unsafe nursing homes, President Biden will call on Congress to provide almost $500 million to CMS, a nearly 25% increase, to support health and safety inspections at nursing homes.\n\nBeef up Scrutiny on More of the Poorest Performers. CMS’s Special Focus Facility (SFF) program identifies the poorest-performing nursing homes in the country for increased scrutiny in an effort to immediately improve the care they deliver. The SFF program currently requires more frequent compliance surveys for program participants, which must pass two consecutive inspections to “graduate” from the program. The SFF program will be overhauled to more quickly improve care for the affected residents, including changes that will make its requirements tougher and more impactful. CMS will also make changes that allow the program to scrutinize more facilities, by moving facilities through the program more quickly. Facilities that fail to improve will face increasingly larger enforcement actions, including termination from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, when appropriate.\n\nExpand Financial Penalties and Other Enforcement Sanctions. CMS will expand the instances in which it takes enforcement actions against poor-performing facilities based on desk reviews of data submissions, which will be performed in addition to on-site inspections. In July 2021, CMS rescinded a Trump Administration change that lowered penalty amounts on bad actor nursing homes for harmful deficiencies by imposing only a one-time fine, instead of more aggressive per-day fines that charge for each day a facility is out of compliance. CMS will now explore making such per-day penalties the default penalty for non-compliance. CMS will also use data, predictive analytics, and other information processing tools to improve enforcement. President Biden is also calling on Congress to raise the dollar limit on per-instance financial penalties levied on poor-performing facilities, from $21,000 to $1,000,000.\n\nIncrease Accountability for Chain Owners of Substandard Facilities. President Biden is calling on Congress to give CMS new authority to require minimum corporate competency to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs, enabling CMS to prohibit an individual or entity from obtaining a Medicare or Medicaid provider agreement for a nursing home (new or existing) based on the Medicare compliance history of their other owned or operated facilities (previous or existing). He is further calling on Congress to expand CMS enforcement authority at the ownership level, enabling CMS to impose enforcement actions on the owners and operators of facilities even after they close a facility, as well as on owners or operators that provide persistent substandard and noncompliant care in some facilities, while still owning others.\n\nProvide Technical Assistance to Nursing Homes to Help them Improve. CMS currently contracts with Quality Improvement Organizations that help providers across the health care spectrum make meaningful quality of care improvements. CMS will ensure that improving nursing home care is a core mission for these organizations and will explore pathways to expand on-demand trainings and information sharing around best practices, while expanding individualized, evidence-based assistance related to issues exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nIncreasing Transparency\n\nFor too long, corporate owners and operators have not been held to account for poor nursing home performance. CMS will improve the public transparency of facility ownership and safeguard nursing home residents.\n\nCreate a Database of Nursing Home Owners and Operators. CMS will create a new database that will track and identify owners and operators across states to highlight previous problems with promoting resident health and safety. This registry will use information collected through provider enrollment and health and safety inspections to provide more information about prospective owners and operators to states. Giving the public a resource to better understand owners’ and operators’ previous violations will empower states to better protect the health and safety of residents.\n\nImprove Transparency of Facility Ownership and Finances. CMS will implement Affordable Care Act requirements regarding transparency in corporate ownership of nursing homes, including by collecting and publicly reporting more robust corporate ownership and operating data. It will also make this information easier to find on the Nursing Home Care Compare website.\n\nEnhance Nursing Home Care Compare: CMS will implement a range of initiatives to improve Nursing Home Care Compare, the rating website designed to help families pick a facility for their loved ones. Under the Biden-Harris Administration’s leadership, CMS has already published new measures on Care Compare, which allow users to consider nursing home staff turnover, weekend staffing levels, and other important factors in their decision-making process. When the new minimum staffing requirement comes online, Care Compare will also prominently display whether a facility is meeting these minimum staffing requirements. CMS will further improve Care Compare by improving the readability and usability of the information displayed—giving you and your family insight into how to interpret key metrics. Finally, CMS will ensure that ratings more closely reflect data that is verifiable, rather than self-reported, and will hold nursing homes accountable for providing inaccurate information. The President is calling on Congress to give CMS additional authority to validate data and take enforcement action against facilities that submit incorrect information.\n\nExamine the Role of Private Equity. As described above, private equity investors are playing a growing role in the nursing home sector, and published research increasingly indicates that facility ownership by investment groups leads to worse outcomes while costing taxpayers more—particularly as these owners have sought to cut expenses at the cost of patient health and safety, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. HHS and other federal agencies will examine the role of private equity, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and other investment ownership in the nursing home sector and inform the public when corporate entities are not serving their residents’ best interests.\n\nCreating Pathways to Good-paying Jobs with the Free and Fair Choice to Join a Union\n\nEnsure Nurse Aide Training is Affordable. Lowering financial barriers to nurse aide training and certification will strengthen and diversify the nursing home workforce. CMSwill establish new requirements to ensure nurse aide trainees are notified about their potential entitlement to training reimbursement upon employment. CMS will further work with states to ensure reimbursement is being distributed and that free training opportunities are widely publicized.\n\nSupport State Efforts to Improve Staffing and Workforce Sustainability. Strengthening the nursing home workforce requires adequate compensation as well as a realistic career ladder. CMS will develop a template to assist and encourage States requesting to tie Medicaid payments to clinical staff wages and benefits, including additional pay for experience and specialization.\n\nLaunch National Nursing Career Pathways Campaign. CMS, in collaboration with the Department of Labor, will work with external entities—including training intermediaries, registered apprenticeship programs, labor-management training programs, and labor unions—to conduct a robust nationwide campaign to recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into long-term care careers, with pathways into health-care careers like registered and licensed nurses.\n\nEnsuring Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness in Nursing Homes\n\nContinued COVID-19 Testing in Long-term Care Facilities. Throughout the pandemic, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided approximately 3 million tests per week to all Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes and thousands more assisted living facilities, supporting outbreak testing and regular testing of staff. HHS will continue to support this key mitigation strategy for vulnerable residents and the staff that care for them.\n\nContinued COVID-19 Vaccinations and Boosters in Long-term Care Facilities. The Biden-Harris Administration has provided the full support of the federal government to states in ensuring that staff and residents across long-term care facilities have access to vaccinations and booster shots. Today, facilities are required to ensure staff are vaccinated and more than 87.1% of residents have received their primary series. CDC continues to offer all facilities the ability to be matched with a federal pharmacy partner to host an on-site vaccination clinic. CMS has reached out to thousands of these facilities directly to offer support, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has made a wide set of tools available. HHS will continue to promote access to these clinics and efforts to integrate vaccinations into routine services, incentivize vaccinations through provider quality payment programs, and continue to provide a full range of resources to continue to build confidence in the vaccine.\n\nStrengthen Requirements for On-site Infection Preventionists.

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Jackson, a regional director, had witnessed problems at three trial sites she was overseeing and complained to an FDA inspector about a range of problems including falsified data, unblinded patients, and inadequately trained vaccinators who were slow to follow up on adverse events. “I thought that the FDA was going to swoop in and take care of everything. What I was reporting was so important,” Jackson told The BMJ. The FDA did not, however, inspect the trial sites in question.\n\nThis lack of oversight was not an isolated case, The BMJ has learnt. Regulatory documents show that only nine out of 153 Pfizer trial sites1 were subject to FDA inspection before licensing the mRNA vaccine. Similarly, only 10 out of 99 Moderna trial sites2 and five of 73 remdesivir trial sites3 were inspected.\n\nNow, facing a backlog of site inspections, experts have criticised the FDA’s oversight of clinical trials, describing it as “grossly inadequate.” They say the problem, which predated covid-19, is not limited to a lack of inspections but also includes failing to notify the public or scientific journals when violations are identified—effectively keeping scientific misconduct from the medical establishment.\n\nThe FDA is “endangering public health” by not being candid about violations that are uncovered during clinical trial site inspections, says David Gortler, a pharmacist and pharmacologist who worked as an FDA medical reviewer between 2007 and 2011 and was then appointed as a senior adviser to the FDA commissioner in 2019-21.\n\n“The lack of full transparency and data sharing does not allow physicians and other medical scientists to confirm the data independently and make comprehensive risk-benefit assessments,” continues Gortler, who is now a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington DC.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9893920/', 'Headline': 'Facebook versus the BMJ: when fact checking goes wrong', 'Snippet': 'The Lead Stories article said that none of the flaws identified by The BMJ’s whistleblower, Brook Jackson, would “disqualify” the data collected from the main Pfizer vaccine trial.

Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of this vaccine was granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this age group on June 17 and an application for conditional Marketing Authorization in this age group is under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220823005341/en/\n\nParticipants in the study received either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (3-μg) as a three-dose series or placebo (2:1 randomization). Vaccine efficacy, a secondary endpoint in the trial, was 73.2% (2-sided 95% CI: 43.8%, 87.6%) among children 6 months through 4 years of age without evidence of prior COVID-19 infection. This analysis was based on 13 cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group (n=794) and 21 cases in the placebo group (n=351), diagnosed from March to June 2022. The study protocol specified that this formal efficacy analysis should be performed when at least 21 total symptomatic COVID-19 cases were identified, each at least seven days after the third dose. Consistent with the time period when the cases occurred, sequencing of viral RNA from illness visit nasal swabs indicated that observed cases were primarily caused by Omicron BA.2. Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 strains were emerging during the period of the study, with only a few cases accrued and efficacy results against these strains were inconclusive. Consistent with our approach in adults, we are working with the FDA to prepare an EUA application for an Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine in children 6 months through 11 years of age.\n\n“Building on the strong safety and immunogenicity data that led to FDA authorization of our COVID-19 vaccine for children 6 months through 4 years, we are pleased to share confirmatory evidence that a full course of vaccination helps protect against symptomatic disease, particularly during a time when the Omicron BA.2 strain was predominant,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer.\n\n“While these results confirm that three 3-µg doses of our COVID-19 vaccine provide young children with a high level of protection at a time when the Omicron BA.2 strain was highly prevalent with a favorable safety profile, we are also developing an Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine in this age group to address these sublineages,” said Prof. Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-Founder of BioNTech.\n\nAmong children ages 6 through 23 months, the vaccine was 75.8% (2-sided 95% CI: 9.7%, 94.7%) effective at preventing COVID-19, based on 4 cases in the vaccine group (n=296) and 8 cases in the placebo group (n=147), after a median of 1.9 months (range: 0.0, 4.9) follow-up after the third dose. For children ages 2 through 4 years of age, the vaccine was 71.8% (2-sided 95% CI: 28.6%, 89.4%) effective at preventing COVID-19, based on 9 cases in the vaccine group (n=498) and 13 cases in the placebo group (n=204), after a median of 2.4 months (range: 0.0, 4.9) follow-up after the third dose.\n\nThree 3-µg doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine continue to be well-tolerated in this age group. The majority of adverse events observed in this age group have been mild or moderate, with a safety profile similar to placebo.\n\nOn July 8, Pfizer and BioNTech submitted safety and immunogenicity data to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) requesting an update to the Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) in the European Union (EU) to include children ages 6 months through 4 years. The companies plan to submit the updated efficacy data to the FDA, EMA and other regulatory agencies around the world in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, was developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder for BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY®) in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries, and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned.\n\nAbout the Phase 1/2/3 Trial in Children\n\nThe Phase 1/2/3 trial has enrolled more than 10,000 children ages 6 months to under 12 years of age in the United States, Finland, Poland, Brazil and Spain from more than 90 clinical trial sites. The trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in three age groups: ages 5 to under 12 years; ages 2 to under 5 years; and ages 6 months to under 2 years. Based on the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial, children ages 5 to under 12 years received a two-dose schedule of 10 µg each while children under age 5 received a lower 3 µg dose for each injection in the Phase 2/3 study. The trial enrolled children with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nU.S. Indication & Authorized Use\n\nPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is FDA authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 6 months of age and older.

A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where the vaccine was administered for monitoring after vaccination. If the vaccine recipient experiences a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest hospital\n\nSeek medical attention right away if the vaccine recipient has any of the following symptoms: difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over the body, dizziness, and weakness\n\nMyocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received the vaccine, more commonly in males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low\n\nSeek medical attention right away if the vaccine recipient has any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine, particularly during the 2 weeks after receiving a vaccine dose:\n\nChest pain\n\nShortness of breath\n\nFeelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart\n\nFainting\n\nUnusual and persistent irritability\n\nUnusual and persistent poor feeding\n\nUnusual and persistent fatigue or lack of energy\n\nPersistent vomiting\n\nPersistent pain in the abdomen\n\nUnusual and persistent cool, pale skin\n\nFainting can happen after getting injectable vaccines, including Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA). Sometimes people who faint can fall and hurt themselves. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask the vaccine recipient to sit or lie down for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine\n\nSome people with weakened immune systems may have reduced immune responses to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA)\n\nAdditional side effects include rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, injection site pain, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, injection site swelling, injection site redness, nausea, feeling unwell, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, arm pain, and fainting in association with injection of the vaccine and irritability\n\nThese may not be all the possible side effects of the vaccine. Call the vaccination provider or healthcare provider about bothersome side effects or side effects that do not go away.\n\nYou should always ask your healthcare providers for medical advice about adverse events. Report vaccine side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The VAERS toll-free number is 1‐800‐822‐7967 or report online to www.vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html.

Issues with data integrity. The employee, Brook Jackson, a former regional director at Ventavia ...', 'Full_text': 'Pharmaceutical company Pfizer has an appalling history when it comes to the efficacy of its drugs and credibility of its claims – paying billions of dollars in compensation over the years for injuries, false claims and suppressing unfavourable research.\n\nNow, the multi-billion dollar juggernaut is under fresh scrutiny after a respected medical journal published an article which reports serious issues with its Covid vaccine safety trials, including the falsification of data.\n\nThe report\n\nThe British Medical Journal’s article centres on information provided by a former employee of Ventavia Research Group, which is a Texas-based contracting company that was involved in the phase-three trials for Pfizer’s Covid vaccine last year.\n\nIssues with data integrity\n\nThe employee, Brook Jackson, a former regional director at Ventavia, told the British Medical Journal that she repeatedly complained to her superiors about poor laboratory management, patient safety concerns and data integrity issues.\n\nThe British Medical Journal also spoke anonymously to two other former Ventavia employees, who “confirmed broad aspects of Ms Jackson’s complaint”.\n\nMs Jackson claims that after alerting the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to various problems she was fired, with Ventavia saying “she was not a good fit.”\n\nAccording to the article, Pfizer’s full phase-three trial involved about 44,000 participants across 153 sites. Ventavia enrolled more than 1000 participants at three sites – or only around 2% of the total, but according to reports Pfizer made no mention of the alleged problems at the Ventavia sites in a briefing document submitted to a US FDA advisory committee meeting in December 2020, only a short time before the vaccines were made widely available.\n\nTGA is downplaying the allegations\n\nThe TGA is downplaying the British Medical Journal article, saying the Pfizer vaccine is “highly safe and effective”, and that Australians “should not be concerned about the issues raised in the article”.\n\nHowever, the Covid Medial Network, a collective of doctors who have raised concerns about Australia’s pandemic management response, reported on its website earlier this year that a Freedom of Information request to the TGA with regard to Pfizer vaccinations confirmed that the Australian drugs regulator approved the vaccine without actually ever seeing the vaccination data.\n\nNone of this has been widely, or publicly discussed because earlier this year Australian healthcare professionals were warned they could be stripped of their ability to practice if they disseminate information about Covid-19 vaccines which regulators consider to be false or misleading.\n\nAnd, while they are rarely reported in the mainstream media, there are plenty of stories circulating on social media about adverse reactions to the vaccine.\n\nThese too, are being ‘downplayed’ by the TGA although it has been actively monitoring myocarditis and pericarditis, the two main, known, side effects of the Pfizer jab, as “adverse events of special interest”.\n\nThe number of cases of heart inflammation in Australia linked to the Pfizer vaccine has risen to almost 300 from about 22.7 million doses.\n\nThese figures include a group of more than 50 teenagers in Victoria aged between 12 and 19 years old who were assessed by the Victorian Specialist Immunisation Service (VicSIS) developed myocarditis.\n\nThe TGA’s website states: “Like other countries, we have observed a higher than-expected number of cases of myocarditis in vaccinated (people) compared to unvaccinated individuals for Comirnaty (Pfizer).\n\nWhile the numbers may seem small in comparison to the number of people who have had the jab, these side effects do exist, and certainly attest to the fact that the vaccine is ‘not safe for all’.\n\nVaccinate at all costs\n\nDespite this, Pfizer vaccines are still being offered to Australians, and have been recommended for Children as young as 12 years old.\n\nThe Pfizer vaccination has also been announced as the ‘booster shot’ that will be available to Australians.\n\nThe continued push by state governments which includes vaccination mandates also leaves Australians with very little choice but to get vaccinated if they want to work or participate in society. Many businesses, schools and other organisations are now taking cues from the state governments and implementing their own vaccine policies too.\n\nNo legal aid work for unvaccinated lawyers\n\nMost recently, the Legal Aid Commission of NSW announced that it will not make legal aid work available to law firms which don’t have vaccinated staff.\n\nThis could impact on the backlog of cases already being channeled through legal aid, and will limit the expertise available to clients seeking assistance through the Commission.\n\nLittle interest in alternatives\n\nBy comparison to what has been invested in vaccination rollouts, the government has invested little in treatment options, or in making rapid-antigen testing an acceptable alternative to the jab, or in shoring up the health system.\n\nSo, it has to be asked whether this is responsible government policy, particularly in a democratic society where people should, ideally, be provided with alternatives and information so they can make their own informed choice.\n\nVaccines are far from a panacea\n\nThere is no disputing that Covid-19, in particular the Delta strain of the virus, is a highly contagious, potentially deadly health threat, but there is also a growing body of evidence being gathered worldwide which suggests not only that there are risks with the vaccines, they are far from a panacea.\n\nWhile vaccines will lessen the severity of the virus if contracted, they don’t necessarily stop transmission, and their efficacy (effectiveness) dwindles over time.\n\nMany countries which have high vaccination rates are still combatting Covid outbreaks, some of them severe. New Zealand has in the past couple of days reported higher case numbers than ever, despite its high vaccination rates. The country is still in lockdown.\n\nWe are also yet to fully understand the implication of long term health complications or side effects of the vaccine.\n\nFurthermore, the Australian Government has not set up a general compensation scheme for anyone who suffers severe effects from the vaccines.\n\nIt has protected the pharmaceutical companies with indemnity, should anyone sue them, but this system essentially means that the onus is on victims or their families to pursue redress through the courts which can be a long, expensive and stressful process.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/vaccinelonghauler/comments/16sybpj/covid19_researcher_blows_the_whistle_on_data/', 'Headline': 'Covid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity ... - Reddit', 'Snippet': 'After 2-3 months if your side effects still persist I feel it would be considered vaccine injury.

During this time, many countries saw daily tally breaking new records and thousands succumbing to the infection. The situation was particularly bad in the United States and Europe, as identified by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nBut there are still some countries which have remained untouched by the pandemic. The WHO has a list, which shows the spread of the infection in various countries. Scrolling down, the list shows at least 10 countries which have reported zero Covid-19 cases.\n\nMost of these countries and territories are islands in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and are likely to be experiencing the benefit of bordering only the sea.\n\nThe list used to be longer a few months ago, but the situation has now changed. In Tonga, where a volcano erupted recently, Covid-19 outbreak began after ships brought aid to the island nation. Similarly, Cook Islands also reported its first case last week.\n\nHere is the list of countries with zero Covid-19 cases, as listed by WHO:\n\nTuvalu: It is a group of three reef islands and six atolls. Though a member of the Commonwealth, Tuvalu kept Covid-19 at bay by closing its borders and mandatory quarantine. According to WHO, nearly 50 people are fully vaccinated per 100 population.\n\nTokelau: The tiny group of atolls in the South Pacific has been listed as Covid-19 free by the WHO. The island is located near New Zealand and has a single airport, with a population of 1,500.\n\nSaint Helena: Situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, it is a British Overseas Territory. According to WHO, 58.16 persons per 100 are fully vaccinated in Saint Helena.\n\nPitcairn Islands: These are located in the Pacific Ocean. The central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States has a detailed profile of the remote group of islands. It says that Polynesians were the first inhabitants of the Pitcairn Islands, but the islands were uninhabited by the time they were discovered by Europeans in 1606. According to WHO, 74 people per 100 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 here.\n\nNiue: This is yet another island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean. It is known for its coal-reef dive sites. According to WHO list, more than 79 people per 100 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 here.\n\nNauru: The tiny country is situated northeast of Australia. It was also a Japanese outpost during the Second World War. According to WHO list, nearly 68 people per 100 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 here.\n\nMicronesia: It is comprised of four states - Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap - that together compose the Federated States of Micronesia, according to the CIA website. According to WHO, per 100 vaccination coverage in Micronesia is 38.37.\n\nApart from these tiny island nations, the WHO has also listed two other countries - Turkmenistan and North Korea - as free of Covid-19.

[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"". [1]', 'Full_text': 'COVID-19 elimination strategy\n\n""Zero-COVID policy"" redirects here. For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://flytrippers.com/countries-without-covid-restrictions/', 'Headline': 'List of the 131 countries where 100% of pandemic travel restrictions ...', 'Snippet': '(That guide to every country’s entry rules will continue to be updated regularly, sign up for free to get all updates, as well as many travel tips and deals!)

While a zero-COVID policy is not only unattainable but now impossible for most countries to achieve, there are lessons to be learned from countries that took a hardline approach to clamping down on cases.\n\nCOVID-19 testing, contact tracing and strict lockdowns were critical in the pursuit of zero-COVID; these have been important in many countries in controlling the spread of the virus too, but countries aiming for zero-COVID implemented them far more intensively with the goal of maximum suppression.\n\nLessons learned\n\nWhen China, with its 1.4 billion population, decided to pursue a zero-COVID policy, many were sceptical. But official figures claim the country has had very few deaths from the virus, although the reality on the ground seems to be far worse than recorded numbers. Regardless of whether its policies, especially on surveillance and track and trace approaches, could be applied to democratic countries, it is clear that China has invested heavily in testing capacity.\n\nNew Zealand was one of the best-known examples of how a stringent lockdown imposed after just a handful of cases led cases to fall to zero, and stay that way for an extended period of time. However, a similar approach in Melbourne took much longer to bring cases down, and scientists in The Lancet point to other aspects of New Zealand’s approach that led to successful control of SARS-CoV-2 spread. This includes “early decisive reactions from health authorities, performant surveillance systems, and targeted testing strategies as much as stringency”.\n\nZero-COVID policies have come at a high cost, however. Millions of people in China, for example, have had food or medicine shortages and border closures that have stopped anyone from leaving the country and anyone else from getting in. As one of the largest global manufacturers, China’s policy has affected the rest of the world too by disrupting supply chains.\n\nCo-existing with the virus\n\nSome countries have pursued zero-COVID at the risk of damaging their economies. But the extreme transmissibility of the Omicron variant combined with the understanding that SARS-CoV-2 will become endemic – it’s just a question of when – means that countries with zero-COVID policies may not be able to hold tight for much longer. Hong Kong, for example, has become so overwhelmed by its zero-COVID policy, which meant every infected person was being sent to hospital regardless of symptoms, that hospitals are having to lay patients out on gurneys on the concrete outside.\n\nAs Rafael Araos, a physician and epidemiologist at the University for Development in Santiago told Nature: “You can’t stop the wind with your hand.”\n\nBeijing has made restrictions more localised and less widespread, and for a shorter period of time, a direction that the rest of the world seems likely to adopt for future restrictions.\n\nFor many countries, vaccinations have paved the way to a gradual loosening of restrictions. With 93% of eligible people vaccinated, even New Zealand began to open up this month in a bid to move towards living with the virus rather than the alternative of staying sealed off for years to come.\n\nSingapore too, with 82% vaccinated, has abandoned its zero-COVID approach in favour of carefully maintaining restrictions as necessary.\n\nCOVID-19 testing, contact tracing and strict lockdowns were critical in the pursuit of zero-COVID; these have been important in many countries in controlling the spread of the virus too, but countries aiming for zero-COVID implemented them far more intensively with the goal of maximum suppression. And for a while, zero-COVID policies helped several countries keep the disease largely at bay. Even though cases are rising as these countries open up, being equipped with more tools than were available at the start of the pandemic has kept deaths relatively low.\n\nAlthough such an intense and prolonged effort to suppress the virus often came with high economic and social costs, the principles of widespread testing, surveillance, and caution are lessons all countries can learn for the next pandemic – as a future pandemic is an inevitability.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cntraveller.com/article/countries-without-covid-restrictions', 'Headline': 'These countries have lifted all coronavirus travel restrictions', 'Snippet': 'Since 2020, we’ve all needed to stay on top of the Covid-related rules for different countries – from where you can travel without a vaccine to which destinations require a Covid booster jab for travel.By spring 2022, however, a handful of European countries (including the UK since Friday 18 March 2022) have lifted all restrictions relating to coronavirus and travel, allowing international ...', 'Full_text': ""Since 2020, we’ve all needed to stay on top of the Covid-related rules for different countries – from where you can travel without a vaccine to which destinations require a Covid booster jab for travel.

Sign up here.\n\nChina is bracing for an unprecedented wave of Covid-19 cases as it dismantles large parts of its repressive zero-Covid policy, with a leading expert warning Omicron variants were “spreading rapidly” and signs of an outbreak rattling the country’s capital.\n\nChanges continued Monday as authorities announced a deactivation of the “mobile itinerary card” health tracking function planned for the following day.\n\nThe system, which is separate from the health code scanning system still required in a reduced number of places in China, had used people’s cell phone data to track their travel history in the past 14 days in an attempt to identify those who have been to a city with zones designated “high-risk” by authorities.\n\nIt had been a point of contention for many Chinese people, including due to concerns around data collection and its use by local governments to ban entry to those who have visited a city with a “high-risk zone,” even if they did not go to those areas within that city.\n\nBut as the scrapping of parts of the zero-Covid infrastructure come apace, there are questions about how the country’s health system will handle a mass outbreak.\n\nThroughout the weekend, some businesses were closed in Beijing, and city streets were largely deserted, as residents either fell ill or feared catching the virus. The biggest public crowds seen were outside of pharmacies and Covid-19 testing booths.\n\nMedia outlet China Youth Daily documented hours-long lines at a clinic in central Beijing on Friday, and cited unnamed experts calling for residents not to visit hospitals unless necessary.\n\nHealth workers in the capital were also grappling with a surge in emergency calls, including from many Covid-positive residents with mild or no symptoms. A hospital official on Saturday appealed to residents in such cases not to call the city’s 911-like emergency services hotline to keep it free for the seriously ill.\n\nThe daily volume of emergency calls had surged from its usual 5,000 to more than 30,000 in recent days, Chen Zhi, chief physician of the Beijing Emergency Center said, according to official media.\n\nCovid was “spreading rapidly” driven by highly transmissible Omicron variants in China, a top Covid-19 expert, Zhong Nanshan, said in an interview published by state media Saturday.\n\n“No matter how strong the prevention and control is, it will be difficult to completely cut off the transmission chain,” Zhong, who has been a key public voice since the earliest days of the pandemic in 2020, was quoted saying by Xinhua.\n\nChanges, and concerns\n\nThe rapid rollback of testing nationwide and the shift by many people to use antigen tests at home has also made it difficult to gauge the extent of the spread, with official data now appearing meaningless.\n\nAuthorities recorded 8,626 Covid-19 cases across China on Sunday, down from the previous day’s count of 10,597 and from the high of more than 40,000 daily cases late last month. CNN reporting from Beijing indicates the case count in the Chinese capital could be much higher than recorded.\n\nOne note seen on a residential building in Beijing is indicative of the larger situation, reading: “Due to the severe epidemic situation in recent days, the number of employees who can come to work is seriously insufficient, and the normal operation of the apartment has been greatly affected and challenged.”\n\nThe country is only days out from a major relaxation of its longstanding zero-Covid measures, which came as a head-spinning change for many Chinese living under the government’s stringent controls and fed a longstanding narrative about the deadliness of Covid-19.\n\nLast Wednesday, top health officials made a sweeping rollback of the mass testing, centralized quarantine, and health code tracking rules that it had relied on to control viral spread. Some aspects of those measures, such as health code use in designated places and central quarantine of severe cases, as well as home isolation of cases, remain.\n\nOutside experts have warned that China may be underprepared to handle the expected surge of cases, after the surprise move to lift its measures in the wake of nationwide protests against the policy, growing case numbers and rising economic costs.\n\nWhile Omicron may cause relatively milder disease compared to earlier variants, even a small number of serious cases could have a significant impact on the health system in a country of 1.4 billion.\n\nZhong, in the state media interview, said the government’s top priority now should be booster shots, particularly for the elderly and others most at risk, especially with Lunar New Year coming up next month – a peak travel time where urban residents visit elderly relatives and return to rural hometowns.\n\nHealth authorities on Sunday ordered improvements in medical capabilities in rural areas by the end of the month.\n\nMeasures to be undertaken include increasing ICU wards and beds, enhancing medical staff for intensive care and setting up more clinics for fevers, China’s National Health Commission said in a statement.\n\n‘Over-hyping’\n\nMeanwhile, experts have warned a lack of experience with the virus – and years of state media coverage focusing on its dangers and impact overseas, before a recent shift in tone – could push those who are not in critical need to seek medical care, further overwhelming systems.\n\nBob Li, a graduate student in Beijing, who tested positive on Friday said he wasn’t afraid of the virus, but his mother, who lives in the countryside, stayed up all night worrying about him. “She finds the virus a very, very scary thing,” Li said.\n\n“I think most people in rural China may have some misunderstandings about the virus, which may come from the overhyping of this virus by the state in the past two years. This is one of the reasons why people are so afraid,” he said, adding that he still supports the government’s careful treatment of Covid-19 during the pandemic.\n\nThere are clear efforts to tamp down on public concern about Covid-19 – and its knock-on effects, like panic buying of medications.\n\nChina’s market watchdog said on Friday that there was a “temporary shortage” of some “hot-selling” drugs and vowed to crack down on price gouging, while major online retailer JD.com last week said it was taking steps to ensure stable supplies after sales for certain medications surged 18 times that week over the same period in October.\n\nA hashtag trending on China’s heavily moderated social media platform Weibo over the weekend featured a state media interview with a Beijing doctor saying people who tested positive for Covid-19 but had no or mild symptoms did not need to take medication to recover.\n\n“People with asymptomatic infections do not need medication at all. It is enough to rest at home, maintain a good mood and physical condition,” Li Tongzeng, chief infectious disease physician at Beijing You An Hospital, said in an interview linked to a hashtag viewed more than 370 million times since Friday.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40940-4', 'Headline': 'Effects of public-health measures for zeroing out different ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China.

These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/', 'Headline': ""What is China's zero-COVID policy and how does it work?"", 'Snippet': 'what is zero-covid?

Last week, her home state became the first to pass a law that establishes safeguards for minors who are featured in online videos – and how they’re compensated.\n\nIllinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker on Friday signed a bill, inspired by Nallamothu’s letter, amending the state’s Child Labor Law that will allow teenagers over the age of 18 to take legal action against their parents if they were featured in monetized social media videos and not properly compensated, similar to the rights held by child actors.\n\nStarting July 1 2024, parents in Illinois will be required to put aside 50% of earnings for a piece of content into a blocked trust fund for the child, based on the percentage of time they’re featured in the video. For example, if a child is in 50% of a video, they should receive 25% of the funds; if they’re in 100%, they are required to get 50% of the earnings. However, this only applies in scenarios during which the child appears on the screen for more than 30% of the vlogs in a 12-month period.\n\n“We understand that parents should receive compensation too because they have equity in this, but we don’t want to forget about the child,” Koehler told CNN.\n\nA family business\n\nMany YouTube parent vloggers or social media influencers post multiple videos each month or weekly, sharing intimate details about their lives, ranging from family financial troubles and the birth of a new baby to opening new toys or going through a child’s phone or report card. Although children are predominantly featured in these monetized videos, parents have had no legal obligation to give them any portion of the earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, kid influencer accounts, which can at times earn $20,000 or more for sponsored posts, are typically run by parents and not often set up in the child’s name due to age restrictions on social media platforms.\n\n“We often see with emerging technology and trends that legislation is always a reaction to that,” Koehler said. “But we know with the explosion of social media that parents are using it to monetize kids being on videos. If money is being made and nothing is set up for the children, it’s the same thing as a child actor.”\n\nA long time coming\n\nThe new law is modeled off of the 1936 Jackie Coogan’s Law, the Hollywood silent actor discovered by Charlie Chaplin whose parents swindled him out of his earnings. That California law required parents to set aside a portion of 15% of child earnings in a blocked trust account that the child actor could access after the age of 18.\n\nAlthough similar bills have been proposed in California and Washington, Jessica Maddox — an assistant professor at The University of Alabama who studies the social media influencer community — said she’s hopeful other states will follow in Illinois’ footsteps.\n\n“Even though Illinois is the first state to pass such a law, this legislation is a long time coming,” Maddox said. “Social media labor and careers are becoming increasingly common and viable forms of income, and it’s important that the law catches up with technology to ensure minors aren’t being exploited.”\n\nPublic conversation about privacy\n\nMaddox said it also breathes new life into the long-simmering debate over what is appropriate for parents to document online and whether a child can really consent to participating.\n\n“I’ve seen organic conversations start to emerge between individuals who had been featured heavily in their parents’ social media content but are now of age to tell their stories and admit that had they really understood what was going on, they would have never consented for their lives to be broadcast for everyone.”\n\nChris McCarty — the 19-year-old founder of Quit Clicking Kids, an advocacy and education site to combat the monetization of children on social media, who is helping to develop child influencer legislation in Washington State — believes that as the kids featured in family vlogs grow up and share their stories, there will be an increase in public pressure to provide more privacy protections.\n\n“When children are slightly older, often the narratives get increasingly personal; for example. detailing trouble with bullies, first periods, doctor’s visits, and mental health issues,” McCarty said. “A lot of consumers assume that children working in a family vlog and child actors have the same experiences. This is not the case. As difficult as it is to be a child actor, child actors are still playing a part rather than having their intimate personal details shared for entertainment and monetary purposes.”\n\nNallamothu agrees that the next step is for legislation to evolve over time to include more regulations around consent.\n\n“I know this bill isn’t going to be perfect off the bat but I don’t want perfection to get in the way of progress because regulations have only started coming up,” she said. “I’m glad it’s getting there.”'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://news.wttw.com/2023/08/16/new-illinois-law-requires-parents-compensate-child-social-media-influencers', 'Headline': 'New Illinois Law Requires Parents to Compensate Child Social Media ...', 'Snippet': 'Illinois Gov.

To qualify, the content must be created in Illinois, and kids would have to be featured in at least 30% of the content in a 30-day period.\n\nVideo bloggers — or vloggers — would be responsible for maintaining records of kids’ appearances and must set aside gross earnings for the child in a trust account for when they turn 18; otherwise, the child can sue.\n\nChildren “deserve to be shielded from parents who would attempt to take advantage of their child’s talents and use them for their own financial gain,” said Alex Gough, a spokesperson for Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, after the governor signed the legislation.\n\nShreya Nallamothu, the teen who brought her concerns to Koehler and set the legislation in motion, first zeroed in on the issue while scrolling through social media during quarantine three years ago.\n\n“I realized that there’s a lot of exploitation that can happen within the world of ‘kidfluencing,’” said Nallamothu, now 16. “And I realized that there was absolutely zero legislation in place to protect them.”\n\nShe clarified that the law is not meant for parents who share photos of their kids on social media for family and friends, or even those who post a viral video. “This is for families who make their income off of child vlogging and family vlogging,” she said.\n\nLawmakers in Illinois, where Democrats hold a supermajority, passed the bill in May with bipartisan support.\n\nOther Democratic-led states have made efforts to regulate the child influencer industry with less success. A 2018 California child labor bill included a social media provision that was removed by the time it was passed. Washington state’s 2023 bill — spearheaded by Chris McCarty, another teen and the founder of Quit Clicking Kids, an advocacy organization focused on protecting minors being monetized online — stalled out in committee.\n\n“I sincerely hope that this momentum continues in other states and eventually nationwide,” McCarty said Friday about the Illinois law.\n\nBut several Republican-led states this year have instead loosened child labor laws to help alleviate workforce shortages. An Iowa law signed at the end of May allows teenagers to work more jobs and for longer hours, and Arkansas in March eliminated permits that required employers to verify a child’s age and a parent’s consent.\n\n___'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nprillinois.org/illinois/2023-08-14/pritzker-signs-child-influencer-protections-into-law', 'Headline': 'Pritzker signs child influencer protections into law - NPR Illinois', 'Snippet': 'Gov.

Specifically, this law amends the state’s Child Labor Law by requiring that “vloggers” set aside a portion of compensation they receive in connection with their video ...', 'Full_text': 'Who does the law apply to?\n\nThe law applies to individuals or families that create compensated video content for use on online platforms (“vloggers”), which content is performed in Illinois and contains the name, photograph, or likeness of a minor under the age of 16, provided the following criteria are met at any time during the previous 12-month period: (1): the minor’s likeness, name, or photograph is in at least 30% of the compensated content produced by the vlogger within a 30-day period, and (2) the number of views received per video on any online platform meets the online platform’s threshold for the generation of compensation or the vlogger received actual compensation for video content equal to or greater than $0.10 per view. The 30% threshold is measured by the percentage of time that the minor’s name, likeness, or photograph either visually appears in the content or is the subject of the oral narrative of the video, as compared to the total length of the video.\n\nThe law doesn’t apply where the minor is creating their own content. Also, note that the law applies where the content creator is compensated, and is not meant to discourage parents who share photos and videos of their children online, or even those parents who post content of their children that accidentally becomes viral.\n\nWhat do content creators need to do?\n\nA vlogger would be required to set aside a portion of the gross earnings from the qualifying video content in a trust account to be preserved for the benefit of the minor upon reaching the age of majority. The amount that is required to be set aside must be at least half of the percentage of the video content that includes the minor’s name, image, or likeness. For example, if the minor is in 100% of the video content, 50% of the gross compensation from the video content must be set aside, while if the minor is in 50% of the video content, 25% of the gross compensation would need to be set aside. If multiple minors are in the video content, the percentage that is set aside is calculated based on the total time all minors are in the video content and must be split equally among accounts for each minor regardless of the time each minor was included in the video content.\n\nDuring the reporting period, vloggers must also keep the following records and produce them to the minor upon request: (1) the minor’s name and proof of the minor’s age, (2) the number of videos that generated qualifying compensation, (3) the total number of minutes of the videos for which the vlogger received compensation, (4) the total number of minutes the minor featured in the videos, (5) the total compensation generated from videos featuring the minor, and (6) the amount deposited into the trust account.\n\nThe trust account must be available only to the minor, with funds available when the minor turns 18 or is emancipated.\n\nWhat are the consequences of non-compliance?\n\nThe law notably creates a private right of action for minors to take legal action against the vlogger for (1) actual damages, (2) punitive damages, and (3) costs and attorneys’ fees, if the minor does not receive the trust from the vlogger or the vlogger does not keep the required records. The law specifically states that the law does not affect a party that isn’t the vlogger or the minor.\n\nWhat do advertisers need to do?\n\nAlthough the law puts the burden on the vlogger to ensure that compensation is properly deposited in a trust account and maintain required records, advertisers that work with influencers who feature minors in their videos (e.g., family content) should consider reviewing their influencer contracts and policies to address these new legal obligations applicable to influencers and discuss how their agencies and influencer networks will be socializing the new requirements. This can be particularly important where lack of compliance on the part of the vlogger could reflect negatively on the brand by association, and the new requirements could factor into compensation negotiations. The timing is opportune given the FTC’s revisions to its endorsement and testimonial guidelines, discussed in more detail at viewpoints.reedsmith.com.\n\nOverall, the law aims to protect child social media influencers by ensuring they are fairly compensated for the effort and time contributed to compensated video content. Content creation is becoming more of a viable path and career, especially for younger individuals. Children want to have an active online presence and ideally be paid as well. Moving forward, other states may follow Illinois’ lead – for example, similar legislation has been proposed in Pennsylvania.\n\nClient Alert 2023-190'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2023/0515/Kidfluencers-are-on-the-rise.-But-who-is-cashing-in', 'Headline': 'Child social media influencers would be protected under Illinois law ...', 'Snippet': 'The Illinois bill would entitle child influencers under the age of 16 to a percentage of earnings based on how often they appear on video blogs or online content that generates at least 10 cents ...', 'Full_text': 'Holed up at home during the pandemic lockdown three years ago, 13-year-old Shreya Nallamothu was scrolling through social media when she noticed a pattern: Children even younger than her were the stars – dancing, cracking one-liners, and being generally adorable.\n\n“It seemed innocuous to me at first,” Shreya said.\n\nBut as she watched more and more posts of kids pushing products or their mishaps going viral, she started to wonder: Who is looking out for them?\n\n“I realized that there’s a lot of exploitation that can happen within the world of ‘kidfluencing,’” said Shreya, referring to the monetization of social media content featuring children. “And I realized that there was absolutely zero legislation in place to protect them.”\n\nIllinois lawmakers aim to change that by making their state what they say will be the first in the country to create protections for child social media influencers. Shreya, now 15, raised her concerns to Illinois state Sen. David Koehler of Peoria, who then set the legislation in motion.\n\nThe Illinois bill would entitle child influencers under the age of 16 to a percentage of earnings based on how often they appear on video blogs or online content that generates at least 10 cents per view. To qualify, the content must be created in Illinois, and kids would have to be featured in at least 30% of the content in a 30-day period.\n\nVideo bloggers – or vloggers – would be responsible for maintaining records of kids’ appearances and must set aside gross earnings for the child in a trust account for when they turn 18; otherwise, the child can sue.\n\nThe bill passed the state Senate unanimously in March and is scheduled to be considered by the House this week. If it wins approval, the bill will go back to the Senate for a final vote before it makes its way to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who said he intends to sign it in the coming months.\n\nFamily-style vlogs can feature children as early as birth and recount milestones and family events – the wholesome clips that Shreya had been initially scrolling through.\n\nBut experts say the commercialized “sharenthood” industry, which can earn content creators tens of thousands of dollars per brand deal, is underregulated and can even cause harm.\n\n“As we see influencers and content creators becoming more and more of a viable career path for young people, we have to remember that this is a place where the law has not caught up to practice,” said Jessica Maddox, a University of Alabama professor who studies social media platforms.\n\nShe added that child influencers “are in desperate need of the same protections that have been afforded to other child workers and entertainers.”\n\nThe Illinois bill is modeled largely after California’s 1939 Jackie Coogan law, named for the silent film-era child actor who sued his parents for squandering his earnings. Coogan laws now exist in several states and require parents to set aside a portion of child entertainers’ earnings for when they reach adulthood.\n\nOther states have tried to pass laws to regulate against potential child exploitation on social media without success. A 2018 California child labor bill included a social media advertising provision that was removed by the time it was passed, and Washington’s 2023 bill stalled in committee.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, France passed a law in 2020 that entitles child influencers under 16 to a portion of their revenue, as well as “the right to forget,” which means video platforms must withdraw the images of the child at the minor’s request. Parental consent is not needed.\n\nIllinois’ own bill underwent several changes during the legislative session that watered down its reach, including stripping out a provision allowing child influencers to request deletion of content once they reached the age of 18 and requiring family vloggers to register their channels.\n\nStill, Chicago-based Tyler Diers, the Midwest executive director of the technology trade association Technet, which opposed the bill before the changes but is now neutral, said that when one state legislature takes up an issue, others tend to follow, “and oftentimes perfect what the first state did.”\n\nShreya emphasized that the Illinois bill isn’t aimed at “parents posting their kids on Facebook for their close family and friends,” or even a funny clip that went viral.\n\n“This is for families who make their income off of child vlogging and family vlogging,” she said.\n\nMany social media platforms – including Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok – don’t allow children to have accounts until they’re at least 13 years old. But that hasn’t stopped them from appearing on social media. And the internet is littered with examples of children being showcased for financial gain – and the harm it has caused as a consequence.\n\nIn 2019, an Arizona mother was accused of torturing her seven adopted children for subpar performances in their popular YouTube series, Fantastic Adventures; a Maryland couple who posted “prank” videos of themselves screaming at their children and breaking their toys lost custody and were sentenced to five years of probation for child neglect.\n\nAnother YouTube couple filmed every step of their family’s process of adopting a young child from China with autism, only to eventually place him in a new home.\n\nChris McCarty, an 18-year-old college student who founded Quit Clicking Kids, an advocacy organization focused on protecting minors being monetized online, and who was the force behind the bill in Washington, noted that “this issue is not going away.”\n\n“Once these kids start growing up, the true extent of the damage inflicted by monetized family channels will be realized,” Mr. McCarty said at a hearing for the Washington bill in February.\n\nTikToker Bobbi Althoff is the mother of two little girls she lovingly refers to as “Richard” and “Concrete” to her 3.7 million followers. Ms. Althoff used to share her older daughter’s face and real name online, but she stopped after people made rude comments about her.\n\n“I kept thinking about my daughter growing up to read these things, and it really upset me because I hate reading things like that about myself,” she said.\n\nWhen she shared her decision on Instagram, she lost thousands of followers and received backlash.\n\n“A lot of people were supportive, but there were definitely a lot of people that were very strange about it,” Ms. Althoff said, describing how some viewers seemed to feel like “they had a relationship with my daughter ... and wanted to keep seeing her grow.”\n\nAlthough TikTok-famous tots are not quite old enough to reflect on their experiences, child reality TV stars of the last decade can offer comparable insight into how it feels to be on the other side of the camera.\n\nOhio-based Jason Welage enjoyed his time as a preteen on TruTV’s 2015 reality show Kart Life, which followed families in the world of go-kart racing. Now 20, Mr. Welage says some of the less pleasant aspects have followed him into adulthood.\n\n“When you Google the show, the first clip that comes up on YouTube is me coming off the track and crying,” he said. “I still hear about it to this day.”\n\nHis parents funneled the $10,000 he earned on the show back into his racing, which can cost families up to $150,000 a year, according to his mother, Meghan, who, like her son, supports the child influencer legislation in Illinois and hopes similar laws will be implemented in other states or even federally.\n\nFor children appearing on social media or TV, “it’s definitely work for them,” she said. Her son “wanted to go play, but instead he had to go sit on a stool in our motorhome and do interviews.”\n\n“There should be something to compensate the child for what they are going through or what they have to do,” she said.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nprillinois.org/illinois/2023-03-12/bill-would-give-child-influencers-a-share-of-parents-vlogging-revenue', 'Headline': 'Bill would give ‘child influencers’ a share of parents’ vlogging ...', 'Snippet': 'Senate Bill 1782 would put children who are featured in vlogs under the protection of the Illinois Child Labor Law.

David Koehler, D-Peoria, compared it to California’s 1938 “Coogan Law” – named after the child silent film star Jackie Coogan – that first protected the income of child actors in Hollywood.\n\nBut Koehler said no such law exists to protect children whose parents make them the subject of social media videos, and if the bill passes, Illinois would become the first state to do so.\n\n“I didn't realize how big of an issue this is. This is a huge issue,” he said. “And we're getting national attention on this.”\n\nThe act of parents sharing photos or videos of their children on platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Instagram is not new. But some parents have turned it into a cottage industry by launching a video blog, or vlog, that generates revenue through advertising, product placements and subscription fees.\n\nPeople who engage in that business are sometimes referred to as “influencers.” That comes from the business practice of endorsing specific products or services in an attempt to influence others to purchase them.\n\nKoehler and Holmes said they got the idea from a 15-year-old student, Shreya Nallamothu, of Normal, who said she began looking into it as part of an independent studies project at her high school.\n\n“When you're scrolling online, do you ever see videos of children or families vlogging every aspect of their life?” She asked. “Most of the time when kids are featured on the internet, it's often wholesome content with no ill intentions. But unfortunately, with the rise of social media, we're starting to see the rise of something called child influencers, and child influencers are essentially kids who are forced to be featured in videos by their parents to rake in more views and more money.”\n\nSenate Bill 1782 would put children who are featured in vlogs under the protection of the Illinois Child Labor Law.\n\nIt provides that if a child under age 16 is depicted in 30 percent or more of a vlogger’s content within a 30-day period and the videos generate compensation, then the child is entitled to a proportionate share of that revenue. In other words, if the child is depicted or discussed in 30 percent of the content, then the child would be entitled to 30 percent of the revenue.\n\nIf more than one child is depicted and they all meet the threshold for being compensated, they would split their share of the revenue evenly.\n\nThat money would have to be set aside in a trust fund that the child or children can access when they turn 18.\n\nIn addition, once the child turns 18, he or she can request the online platform to remove any content in which they are depicted.\n\n“Because a lot of kids are, quite frankly, videoed and it's really funny,” Koehler said. “But when they're, you know, 20 years old they may not think it’s so funny.”\n\nAlthough the bill passed out of the Labor Committee, Koehler said he plans to bring an amendment to clarify aspects of the bill before it’s considered by the full Senate.""}}",91.25,2

In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected].\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/capitol-rioter-photographed-pelosis-podium-jan-6-sentenced-prison-rcna17409', 'Headline': ""Capitol rioter photographed with Pelosi's podium on Jan. 6 sentenced to ..."", 'Snippet': 'Adam Johnson bragged he ""broke the internet"" when he was photographed carrying Nancy Pelosi\'s lectern during the attack on the U.S. Capitol. ... where Ashli Babbitt was shot — to 75 days in prison.', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — A Florida man who bragged he ""broke the internet"" when he was photographed carrying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s podium during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was sentenced to 75 days in prison on Friday.\n\nAdam Johnson, a stay-at-home father of five boys, traveled to D.C. in support of former President Donald Trump\'s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost to President Joe Biden. U.S. District Court Judge Reggie B. Walton sentenced Johnson to prison on Friday, saying Johnson made ""a mockery"" of the events by grabbing Pelosi\'s lectern and played an active role in the attack. Walton said he just couldn\'t overlook Johnson\'s behavior, which he said was deserving of a period of incarceration. Johnson will get credit for some time he\'s already served, and will also pay a $5,000 fine.\n\n""We\'re on a dangerous slide in America,"" Walton said Friday, calling what happened on Jan. 6 something you\'d expect to ""see in banana republics."" Walton asked Johnson how he could hold himself out as a good role model for his five children when he came to D.C. and did what he did on Jan. 6.\n\nJohnson, speaking to the court on Friday, said he\'d been ""nothing but cooperative"" with the government since his arrest, and said his actions demonstrated that he was apologetic and was ""ashamed"" to have been a part of the Capitol riot.\n\nJohnson said he recognized that if he did what he did in another country, he\'d be ""on a firing wall instead of a courtroom."" He claimed he had no intent to harm Pelosi.\n\n""If I did find her, I would ask for a selfie with her, if anything,"" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson pleaded guilty to a criminal count of entering and remained in a restricted building or grounds, admitting that he unlawfully entered the Capitol after witnessing battles with police outside the building, and then grabbed Pelosi\'s podium ""because he believed it would make a good prop for a picture."" Johnson also admitted that he shouted that a bust of George Washington would be ""a great battering ram"" as rioters attempted to break into the floor of the U.S. House, where members of Congress were still present.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Arco told the court Friday that Johnson\'s conduct deserves prison time. She played a video of Johnson jiggling the door of what he thought was Pelosi\'s office. There can be no question, Arco said, that Johnson knew he was part of a violent mob.\n\n""Mr. Johnson was part of a mob,"" Arco said. ""He knew that.”\n\nJustice Department prosecutors argued in a memo ahead of his sentencing that Johnson\'s actions illustrated his ""sense of entitlement and privilege"" and that he appeared ""defiant and righteous in his trespassing, which he celebrated by posting this photo to Facebook."" Federal prosecutors had requested a sentence of 90 days behind bars.\n\nJohnson\'s attorneys claimed in their own filing that Johnson ""deeply regrets his participation in the breach of the U.S. Capitol on January 6"" and that the ""damage and violence inflicted on that date by others is contrary to everything he believes in."" They argued that his five children would be negatively impacted by his imprisonment, and that Johnson received extra scrutiny because the lectern he grabbed belonged to the speaker of House.\n\n""Unfortunately, he received considerable attention simply because the lectern belonged to Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi,"" they wrote. ""Arguably, if he latched onto some other piece of government furniture for his photo opportunity jail time would not even be a consideration.""\n\nThe FBI has arrested more than 740 people in connection with the U.S. Capitol attack, out of more than 2,500 individuals who engaged in chargeable criminal conduct that day. Sentences have ranged from probationary sentences and fines for misdemeanor defendants to five years in federal prison for Robert Scott Palmer, who attacked officers with a fire extinguisher and received the longest sentence of any Capitol rioter so far.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/01/06/ashli-babbitts-mom-defends-daughters-actions-at-jan-6riot/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's mom defends daughter's actions at Jan. 6riot"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt was a 36-year-old Air Force veteran and Trump supporter.

Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas.

Joe Lancaster | 1.4.2022 3:15 PM', 'Full_text': 'On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli Babbitt, the Capitol rioter who was shot and killed by a police officer while trying to enter the Speaker\'s Lobby on January 6. In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-manufactured-martyr-ashli-babbitt-191518760.html', 'Headline': 'Trump’s ‘manufactured martyr’: How Ashli Babbitt’s death was weaponised ...', 'Snippet': 'Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating ...', 'Full_text': '“Every time he talks about her, he says her name. He could say ‘her’ or ‘she; or whatever. But he says ‘Ashli Babbitt’.""\n\nThat is how Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt, described the way Donald Trump talks about her daughter, who died one year ago today on 6 January, 2021, while trying to overturn the former president’s election defeat.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old US Air Force veteran from San Diego, California, was shot dead by a police officer as she climbed through the window of a barricaded door inside the Capitol building. She was part of a crowd of Trump supporters that had stormed the seat of the US Senate to stop it ratifying the election result, with some allegedly planning to do so by armed force.\n\nIn a less polarised era, American politicians in both parties might have rallied around the officer who shot her. Today, though, she has become a martyr to many of Mr Trump’s followers, praised and venerated by a movement that is increasingly willing to endorse political violence to keep its opponents out of power.\n\nRepublican members of congress including Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Matt Gaetz of Florida have taken up her cause, as have Fox News, the pro-Trump TV station Newsmax and even Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne right-wing group, Look Ahead America, has called for a vigil in Babbitt’s name for those in prison awaiting trial for their alleged actions on 6 January. Donations to a ""Justice for Ashli Babbitt legal fund"" continue to pour in, with more than $378,000 (£278,500) raised as of Wednesday.\n\nFollow live updates on the January 6 anniversary\n\nMr Trump himself has been her cheerleader in chief, referring to her death as a murder. and offering her family his ""unwavering"" support"". ""To Ashli’s family and friends, please know that her memory will live on in our hearts for all time,"" he said in a video specially filmed for her birthday on 10 October. ""There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli.""\n\nTerrorism experts and anti-racist groups find the former president’s intervention deeply disturbing, comparing it to the way Islamic fundamentalists and the Nazi Party in the 1940s used manufactured martyrs to inspire further acts of violence.\n\nFor Cara Castronuova, a pro-Trump activist who co-founded the group Citizens Against Political Persecution to advocate for alleged January 6 rioters, it is a vindication of many months fighting to reframe the storming of the Capitol as a peaceful protest and its alleged invaders as political prisoners.\n\n""At first her name was taboo, even in conservative media,"" Ms Castronuova tells The Independent. ""Nobody would talk about her, nobody would mention her, nobody would mention anybody’s name from 6 January. There was a three to four month block of time at the beginning of 2020... and then it just snowballed.""\n\nWho was Ashli Babbitt?\n\nWhen Ashli Babbitt quit the US military in 2016, she left at the rank of senior airman with 12 years of service and eight deployments behind her. Having enlisted in the US Air Force (USAF) straight out of high school in 2003, she protected bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, protected USAF bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Katar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAt one point, she had even guarded the seat of the US government, serving in an Air National Guard unit known as the ""Capital Guardians"" at a base near Washington DC. In 2013, she was part of the DC Air National Guard’s security detail for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nBabbitt grew up in Lakeside, California, not far from San Diego, the oldest sister to four younger brothers. One former classmate told Insider that she was ""disruptive"" in class, highly opinionated and always trying to be ""one of the guys"".\n\nThat bolshy nature survived throughout her service, with former comrades saying she struggled to be promoted and was demoted at least once due to spats with superiors. One friend described her as ""small but mighty"" (Babbitt was 5 feet 2 inches tall), unafraid to contradict her officers when she disagreed.\n\n""Ashli was headstrong and impulsive,"" said Sgt Eirik Blackwolf, who served with her in the DC Air National Guard. ""She didn’t hold back on her opinion to anyone, no matter their rank, especially if she thought they were wrong or behaving unethically.""\n\nDuring one deployment Babbitt was injured in a mortar strike that knocked her onto a pile of debris. Augustine Luna, a close friend, told Insider that the impact damaged Babbitt’s uterus and left her unable to bear children, but that Babbitt rarely mentioned this.\n\nIn 2015 Babbitt began working as a private security guard for a nuclear power plant in Maryland, where she met her future second husband Aaron Babbitt. That was also the year Mr Babbitt’s then-girlfriend Celeste Norris first encountered Ashli.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ms Norris said Mr Babbitt at first described the new girl as ""this foul-mouthed chick that’s on shift"". Later, Ms Norris found out the two were dating, and broke up with Mr Babbitt.\n\nThe next year, Ms Norris said, she was waiting at a stop sign when a white SUV barged through nearby traffic and repeatedly rammed into her car. When they stopped, Babbitt got out and began hammering with her hand on the window. ""It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was,"" said Ms Norris. ""Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.""\n\nA court acquitted Babbitt of criminal charges, but Ms Norris secured a restraining order against her, and later mounted a personal injury lawsuit that Babbitt settled out of court. In court documents from 2017, Ms Norris wrote that Babbitt had continued to follow her home from work and harass her. ""I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,"" she told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Babbitt moved to San Diego to help buy out and run a swimming pool supply company where her brothers, her uncle and her husband all worked together. ""It was kind of nice, a family affair,"" her brother Roger said.\n\nBabbitt and her husband became daily customers at a brewery near the San Diego sea front, often with their three ex-military dogs in tow. According to brewery owner Jim Millea, the pair had a polyamorous relationship with one of his bartenders. Babbitt herself often arrived fuming about a political issue that had grabbed her attention.\n\nYet the pool supply business quickly got into trouble. Babbitt took out a short term business loan with a steep interest rate and was sued by the lender for failing to make payments, ultimately being ordered by a judge to pay it all back. In 2019, she sold the house where her parents had lived for nearly 20 years, reportedly making them feel ""kicked out of their own home"".\n\nBy this time, Babbitt was a staunch Trump supporter and an opponent of lockdown measures. Her company’s office bore a sign reading: ""Mask-free autonomous zone, better known As America"".\n\nHer brother told the New York Times that she had felt free after leaving the military, and had been angry with the number of homeless people in San Diego and the challenges for small business owners.\n\nOne customer told CBS 8 San Diego that he dropped Babbitt’s company after she went on an unprovoked political rant. “She just started talking about people who oppose Trump and about Nancy Pelosi and [Chuck] Schumer and homeless people,"" the customer said. ""A lot of it didn’t even make any sense. It literally went on for about a minute and a half... it was shocking that she would be talking to a customer the way she was talking to me.""\n\nEven so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents. ""I don’t really know why she decided to do this,"" her mother-in-law toldFox 5 Washington DC last year.\n\nHer social media accounts, however, told an all too familiar story.\n\n‘Nothing will stop us’\n\nOn 7 September, 2020, tweeting under the username @CommonSenseAsh, Ashli Babbitt posted a photo of herself smiling in sunglasses and a black tank top, posing in front of an old-fashioned boat in the harbour of San Diego.\n\nTo many the photo might have looked innocuous, a happy selfie from a nice day out. But her shirt bore the slogan ""We are Q"" – a reference to the anonymous purported government insider who inspired the cult-like millenarian movement known as QAnon.\n\nFor almost a year, Babbitt had been posting in support of QAnon, which believes Mr Trump’s Democratic opponents are part of a global Satanist paedophile ring. Adherents think Mr Trump himself is the figurehead for a secret plot by ""white hats"" (ie, good guys) to sweep the Satanists from power in a military coup, resulting in mass imprisonment or execution.\n\nThe movement has been tied to violent acts including murders, kidnappings, terror plots, attempted bombings, and vehicular attacks, as well as campaigns of online harassment and death threats.\n\nBabbitt’s radical shift came gradually. Back in 2018, she had told another user that she had voted for Barack Obama and still believed he had done ""great things"", but had turned to Mr Trump because she could not stomach Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Ms Luna, Babbitt had voted for Trump in 2016 because he was not a career politician, but soon began calling Democrats ""commies"" and skirmished aggressively offline and online with anyone who disputed her anti-mask beliefs.\n\nIn November 2019, she tweeted about Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that went viral among Trump supporters in 2016 and was a key precursor to QAnon. Online activists had fixated on chance words in hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders as evidence of a secret child sex dungeon beneath a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. Later one of them stormed the restaurant with a rifle to rescue the supposed children, but found nothing.\n\nIn February 2020, Babbitt tweeted her first of many QAnon slogans. Most often she retweeted QAnon influencers such as the lawyer Lin Wood. Ms Luna told Insider that Babbitt was drawn in by the idea that children were in danger, spending hours every week reading about missing kids and appalled that QAnon’s claims were not being taken seriously in the mainstream media.\n\nAccording to Prof Mia Bloom, a terrorism researcher at Georgia University, QAnon’s appeals to ""save the children"" are ""almost verbatim"" how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) recruited three British schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, London, in 2015.\n\n""This kind of message that builds upon someone’s innate goodness is a very different pathway into terrorism than we ordinarily think,"" says Prof Bloom. ""We assume that it’s about hatred, it’s about violence, it’s about racism and white supremacy on the Right and jihadi ideology for [Islamic] groups, when in fact a lot of the pull factors can be based in what we would consider to be very positive attributes.""\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Babbitt did not accept the results of the 2020 election and plunged wholeheartedly into the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. On 1 January, 2021, Babbitt tweeted that she would be in Washington DC on the 6th for a rally addressed by Mr Trump.\n\nOn 5 January, she boarded a plane in San Diego and texted to her friend that there were ""tons of Trump supporters"" flying with her. Another user tweeted that some flights to DC were being cancelled, supposedly to prevent people from attending the 6 January rally.\n\nBabbitt replied: ""Nothing will stop us. They can try and try and try, but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.""\n\nWhen Trump’s army stormed the Capitol, Ashli Babbitt was among the mob that gathered in a stairwell near the chamber of the House of Representatives, where up to 80 members of congress and staff were sheltering. She was wearing a Trump flag on her shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe crowd began hammering on the doors out of the stairwell, which were barricaded from the other side with furniture. One window broke, and Ashli Babbitt, who was unarmed, climbed through. A gunshot rang out, and she fell back with a bullet in her shoulder.\n\nPro-Trump activists have found their George Floyd\n\nLast August, the police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt finally broke his silence. For months Lt Michael Byrd, who is black, had been in hiding due to repeated death threats and racist attacks after Mr Trump falsely claimed he worked for a ""high-ranking"" Democratic politician.\n\n""I know that day I saved countless lives,"" Lt Byrd told NBC News. “I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nBabbitt did not become a Trumpist hero overnight. The day after the riot, Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin, who saw Babbitt’s death, said that Lt Byrd had not had any choice. ""The mob was going to come through the door,"" he told ABC. ""There was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many Trump supporters believed she was a plant or a stooge, put into the crowd by the FBI or other dark forces. In April, the US Department of Justice closed its investigation with no criminal charges.\n\nBy the time of Lt Byrd’s interview, however, Babbitt’s name had become a clarion call in what Ms Castronuova calls the conservative ""underground"" of alternative media and social media. Ms Castronuova was among the first people to interview Babbitt’s family on InfoWars, a fringe news site that often promotes conspiracy theories and has been banned from most major social networks for hate speech.\n\n""[Trump] is really in tune with the community, his base,"" Ms Castronuova says. ""The underground will start to buzz, then Donald Trump picks up on it."" Soon enough, at rallies and in interviews last summer, Mr Trump was calling Babbitt ""an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman"", someone who was on his ""side"", and said there was ""no reason for"" her to die. Ms Castronuova says his backing was ""instrumental"".\n\nMr Trump’s efforts increased after a personal phone call to Mrs Witthoeft, who had become politically active. She has now spoken at a Trump rally and has backed her daughter’s actions, saying: ""She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.""\n\nMs Castronuova says: ""[Babbitt’s] mother has been really instrumental too. She became quite an advocate. She was afraid to speak out at first... but when she finally started speaking out, things really started to change.""\n\nBabbitt’s family sued the District of Columbia to uncover Lt Byrd’s identity, and plans to file wrongful death lawsuits against Lt Byrd himself and the Capitol Police. Terrell Roberts III, a lawyer for Babbitt’s husband Aaron, declined to comment and declined an interview on Mr Babbitt’s behalf.\n\nDonations to Mr Babbitt’s legal fund continue to roll in, with many donors identifying themselves as military veterans. Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating Democratic secrets.\n\nMany Trump supporters have compared Babbitt to George Floyd, a black man murdered by police in Minnesota, lifting the Black Lives Matter slogan ""say her name"" used in reference to many victims of police brutality.\n\nOn the private messaging app Telegram, which is popular on the far right, pro-Trump channels frequently invoke Babbitt’s name, sharing news articles about her family’s lawsuit or claiming that she was set up by informants. Many asked the question ""who killed Ashli Babbit?"" which Mr Trump later echoed.\n\n""The entire scenario looks to be staged. So who is the rotting fish head of what appears to be a deliberate false flag? Who or what group set this up?"" said the evangelist channel Veteran Patriots. The Proud Boys, a fascist militia, have begun using a stylised image of Babbitt as a logo, with the slogan: ""They can’t kill us all.""\n\nBritish radicals have also taken up her cause. ""Her name was Ashli Babbitt,"" said British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. ""She was murdered by the state and her name was dragged through the mud by the media."" An account identifying itself as former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has invoked her name several times.\n\nSome appear to believe she is not even dead. ""Ashli Babbitt false [is a] flag, she’s alive living underground,"" said a QAnon channel called Gitmo TV.\n\n‘A weapon of mass radicalisation’\n\nTo Prof Bloom, Babbitt’s transformation into an innocent victim of Leftist injustice has a worrying historical echo: Horst Wessel, the young Nazi street-fighter who was turned into a symbol of fascist heroism by Josef Goebbel’s propaganda apparatus.\n\nWessel was shot in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party, probably as part of a dispute over unpaid rent with his Communist landlady. By 1936, after the Nazis took power, official media referred to him as greater than Jesus Christ and the Horst Wessel Song was Germany’s joint national anthem.\n\n""Fake martyrdoms succeed because they feed off the shared grievances and anger of the crowd, serving as justification for future retaliatory violence,"" wrote Prof Bloom and another researcher, Sophia Moskalenko, with whom Prof Bloom has co-authored a book about QAnon. ""Ashli Babbitt’s unfortunate death is a weapon of mass radicalisation, just like Horst Wessel’s death was manipulated by Goebbels.""\n\nIndeed, the Nazis’ modern successors have particularly embraced Babbitt, turning an enthusiastic Trump supporter with a chequered past who was killed in a chaotic riot into a towering hero or innocent victim of police brutality while seeking to pin the blame on black and Jewish people.\n\n""Unlike ‘Saint Floyd’, Ashli Babbitt will receive no justice from this sick anti-white system,"" said one white supremacist Telegram channel. ""But we will always remember her sacrifice and she will never be forgotten. There is a day coming not far from now when we will erect statues in her honor.""\n\nThe same channel referred to Lt Byrd as a ""black parasite who gets to kill an unarmed white woman and walk around unbothered"", threatening to make him ""account for his actions"". Another neo-Nazi channel claimed that ""Ashli Babbitt was killed because she was white"".\n\nAlex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates against antisemitism and other forms of racism, says such messages are part of a widespread effort by white supremacists to lure recruits from the broader pro-Trump community.\n\n""White supremacists will always try to twist whatever major story is in the news to fit their agenda,"" says Mr Friedfeld. It’s unclear how successful these efforts have been, but the fact that they are trying to leverage the Babbitt story is deeply concerning because it raises the likelihood that someone is radicalised.""\n\nProf Bloom agrees, comparing it to the Proud Boys’ attempts last summer to recruit ""incel"" anti-feminists. She says that while many QAnon believers are not consciously racist, and not all are white, the movement has a pervasive racial bias, with trafficked children usually depicted as white whereas real world child trafficking disproportionately affects children of colour.\n\nProf Bloom also points out that another protester, Rosanne Boyland, died during the riot but has not been turned into a martyr in the same way. The reason, she argues, is that unlike Babbitt’s family, the Boyland’s have blamed Mr Trump for their loved one’s death.\n\nA threat from within America’s military\n\nThe martyrdom of Ashli Babbitt paints a foreboding picture of where American politics is going. To Prof Bloom and Prof Moskalenko, martyrs are a ubiquitous manufactured product of radical movements, useful because of their potency in rallying followers to stay in the fight and seek revenge against the enemy.\n\nMs Castronuova stops short of saying Babbitt was an example others should follow, describing her as a good person sucked into an ""emotionally charged"" and chaotic situation. She is happy to call Babbitt a martyr, claiming: ""She was killed because of her political beliefs, and they continue to kill her image and her memory because of her political beliefs. If she was a liberal and she hated Donald Trump, she would be remembered very fondly by the media.""\n\nMr Friedfelder, however, fears that Babbitt’s lionisation could contribute to an escalating cycle of conflict, and considers politicians’ embrace of Babbitt to be dangerous. While most Republicans have not embraced the idea that she was unjustly killed, few have publicly rebuked it, apparently reluctant to openly challenge Mr Trump even now he is out of office.\n\nThat does not mean they are happy behind the scenes. On Wednesday Mr Trump cancelled a press conference on the anniversary of the riot, reportedly under pressure from mainstream Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he had played golf with Mr Trump at the weekend and warned him that there ""could be peril"" in such an event. Still, history suggests that Mr Trump’s concessions to moderates are rarely permanent.\n\nMr Friedfelder says: ""Her martyrdom turns her into a call to action... it is one thing for extremists to embrace Babbitt, but it is another for the former president and several high-profile members of the Republican Party to do the same. These officials are supposed to be trusted figures and people look to them for guidance when trying to understand national events.""\n\nClaims that Babbitt was murdered or assassinated continue to spread on social media, according to data from the online discussion tracking firm Zignal Labs. Mr Trump’s and Mr Putin’s comments caused spikes in mentions of Babbitt, and the general discussion around 6 January has barely waned over the past year.\n\nProf Bloom believes there is a more acute threat too: Babbitt’s military record. According to a report from START, an academic coalition that studies terrorism, at least 118 of the 719 people charged in connection with the riot, about 16 per cent of the whole, are veterans. In a START extremism database, about 7 per cent of all far-right cases had military experience, with the rest simply listed as unknown.\n\n""We don’t know how many American military [members] have been radicalised, either by MAGA or specifically by QAnon and white supremacy,"" says Prof Bloom. ""There has been a problem of white supremacy in the military for decades that the military has been reticent to deal with.\n\n""It’s dangerous because it’s not just some flunky who wants to make a name for themselves. It’s someone with military training who has weapons and knows how to use them."" She compares most pro-Trump extremists with the bumbling jihadists in 2010’s Four Lions, with lots of anger but limited ways to direct it. ""When you have someone who has been trained by the military or law enforcement, they know how to use that anger.""\n\nProf Moskalenko worries that the conditions are set for yet more political violence in America. ""A martyrdom is a symbol of perceived widespread injustice and suffering. There’s a lot of that going around,"" she says. ""With or without Ashli Babbit, we have problems. Addressing them, rather than getting stuck in the never-ending cycle of rhetoric, competing narratives, and shifting moral frames, is our only hope.""'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot', 'Headline': 'Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot', 'Snippet': 'claim: ashli babbitt was killed by an officer working for democrats Babbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the ...', 'Full_text': 'Millions of Americans watched the events in Washington last Jan. 6 unfold on live television. Police officers testified to the violence and mayhem. Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.\n\nYet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public’s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained attack on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.\n\nBy excusing former President Donald Trump of responsibility, minimizing the mob’s violence and casting the rioters as martyrs, falsehoods about the insurrection aim to deflect blame for Jan. 6 while sustaining Trump’s unfounded claims about the free and fair election in 2020 that he lost.\n\nSpread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes.\n\nSeveral different conspiracy theories have emerged in the year since the insurrection, according to an analysis of online content by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs on behalf of The Associated Press. Unfounded claims that the rioters were members of antifa went viral first, only to be overtaken by a baseless claim blaming FBI operatives. Other theories say the rioters were peaceful and were framed for crimes that never happened.\n\nConspiracy theories have long lurked in the background of American history, said Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University professor who studies political misinformation. But they can become dangerous when they lead people to distrust democracy or to excuse or embrace violence.\n\n“If we’re no longer operating from the same foundation of facts, then it’s going to be a lot harder to have conversations as a country,” Carnahan said. “It will fuel more divisions in our country, and I think that ultimately is the legacy of the misinformation we’re seeing right now.”\n\nAn examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T TRUMP SUPPORTERS\n\nIn fact, many of those who came to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said — proudly, publicly, repeatedly — that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nDifferent versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa.\n\n“Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,” Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.”\n\nThe next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim.\n\nAnother Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven’t been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants.\n\nYet Carlson claimed on his show that “in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.”\n\nCarlson is a “main driver” of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal’s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.\n\n“Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,” Gaetz said.\n\nSpokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.\n\nIn truth, the rioters are just who they said they were.\n\nOne was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.\n\n“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans said on the video. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” Vice President Mike Pence was in the building to preside over the Senate’s certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. Pence went ahead despite Trump’s pleas to get Pence to block the transfer of power.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by “fake Trump protesters.”\n\n“We have not seen evidence of that,” said Wray, who was appointed by Trump.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T VIOLENT\n\nDozens of police officers were severely injured. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and died a day later of natural causes.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who rushed to the scene, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” The assault stopped only when he said he had children. He later learned he had suffered a heart attack. Fanone resigned from the department in December 2021.\n\nRioters broke into the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled under armed protection. They rifled through desks and looked for lawmakers, yelling, “Where are they?” In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.\n\nThat’s not how some Republican politicians have described the insurrection.\n\nAppearing on Ingraham’s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.\n\n“By and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has since said that he doesn’t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a “normal tourist visit.” Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.\n\nTrump called the insurrection a display of “ spirit and faith and love.”\n\nRioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose.\n\n“The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,” Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. “And, you know, I won’t be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.”\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS\n\nTrump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nImmediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been “cheated” and “defrauded” in the “rigged” election by a “criminal enterprise” that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol.\n\nAt one point, Trump did urge his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.” The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric.\n\n“We fight. We fight like hell,” he told those who would later break into the Capitol. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nNow, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.\n\n“I wasn’t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,” Trump said on Fox News in December.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN OFFICER WORKING FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nBabbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed. An investigation cleared the officer of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Capitol Police Department protects all members of Congress, as well as employees, the public and Capitol facilities. The officer wasn’t assigned to any particular lawmaker.\n\nTrump falsely claimed the officer was the head of security “for a certain high official, a Democrat,” and was being shielded from accountability. He also misstated where Babbitt was shot.\n\n“Who is the person that shot … an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?” Trump asked on Fox News.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE JAN. 6 SUSPECTS ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ARE BEING MISTREATED\n\nNo, they are not, despite some assertions from members of Congress.\n\n“J6 defendants are political prisoners of war,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted in November. She said she had visited some suspects in jail who complained about the food, medical care and “re-education” they were receiving in custody.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said the Justice Department was “harassing peaceful patriots” by investigating their involvement in the insurrection.\n\nWhile it’s true some of the suspects have complained about their time in jail, it’s wrong to argue they’re being held as political prisoners. Authorities have said the suspects in custody are being given the same access to food and medical care as any other inmate.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist - The New York ...', 'Snippet': 'On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol ...', 'Full_text': 'A mountain of evidence shows that the rioters were supporters of Mr. Trump, but that has not stopped the cascade of specious claims seeking to pin responsibility on others.\n\nA false theory blaming agitators affiliated with antifa, a loose collection of antifascist activists, began to spread on social media before the riot had even ended. Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}}",94.08333333333333,2

Numbers are numbers,"" Arizona Senate President Karen Fann said at a hearing last year on the review of the audit.\n\nState Senate Republicans hired Cyber Ninjas to conduct an election audit of ballots in Maricopa County, the state\'s most populous county, after Biden flipped the state to blue for the first time in decades — beating former President Donald Trump by more than 10,400 votes.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/arizona-supreme-court-rules-state-senate-can-keep-election-audit-records-secret', 'Headline': 'Arizona Supreme Court rules state Senate can keep election audit ... - PBS', 'Snippet': 'The Senate disclosed more than 20,000 records after court orders prompted by lawsuits filed by American Oversight and the Arizona Republic, orders that the Supreme Court refused to block last year.', 'Full_text': 'PHOENIX (AP) — The Arizona Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the state Senate can keep hundreds of secret emails and other records related to its partisan review of the 2020 election because they are “privileged” and exempt from disclosure under state public records law.\n\nWATCH: Election deniers are winning primary races, raising the stakes for November’s midterms\n\nThe unanimous ruling means the public will likely never know much of what Republican Senate President Karen Fann and GOP Sen.

The Senate then launched the review, which found the ballot count results were true.\n\nLogan’s report did raise a series of other claims about potential problems with the election, most since disproven. They include the potential for election equipment to be connected to the internet or that large numbers of ballots were cast by dead voters.\n\nREAD MORE: Across the country, Republican primaries feature candidates who deny outcome of 2020 election\n\nThe ruling written by Justice John Lopez says legislative privilege applies because the audit was part of an investigation that could conceivably lead to new election laws. That is enough to shield the approximately 1,000 emails, text messages and other communications the Senate refused to release.\n\n“The Audit is a legislative activity within the legislature’s authority, and communications concerning this activity are covered by legislative privilege,” Lopez wrote. “Consequently, the Senate’s internal communications concerning the authorization, planning, and findings of the Audit investigation are privileged.”\n\nThe ruling overturns both a trial court judge and the state court of appeals, which took narrow views of legislative privilege and held that the public had a right to know what senators discussed about the audit.\n\n“It’s a win for the Senate on every issue unanimously,” said Kory Langhofer, the Senate’s lawyer. “It couldn’t be a better ruling.”\n\nThe Senate will have to reveal any records that are political in nature or involve the administration of the audit itself, but the Senate had already agreed to do that.\n\nFann said in a statement that the Senate’s position that the records could be kept secret was supported by “decades of precedent” from state and federal courts.\n\n“We absolutely believe in transparency, however, there are times when legislative privilege should be exercised so that we can do the jobs that the people of Arizona elected us to carry out,” Fann said.\n\nThe public records lawsuit the court decided was filed by a watchdog group called American Oversight, which pushes for government transparency, shortly after the audit was launched in spring 2021.\n\nThe Senate disclosed more than 20,000 records after court orders prompted by lawsuits filed by American Oversight and the Arizona Republic, orders that the Supreme Court refused to block last year. But it withheld all or part of about 1,000 other documents, citing legislative privilege meant to promote robust debate among elected officials.\n\nWATCH: Primary victories showcase strength of the ‘Big Lie’ in the Republican Party\n\nThe court of appeals said privilege did not apply because the audit was mainly political, no legislation was being considered and the Senate failed to show releasing the documents would impair its deliberations. The Supreme Court rejected those findings, which American Oversight said will keep important information hidden from public view.\n\n“While legislative privilege should protect legitimate functions of the legislature, extending the privilege to activities that the Court recognized as uniquely politicized is misguided,” American Oversight Executive Director Heather Sawyer said in a statement. “This ruling makes it easier for officials to hide the truth about their motives and conduct from the public.”\n\nThe high court ordered the judge who issued the initial ruling saying the records must be released to review an updated “privilege log,” filed by the Senate’s lawyers. But the Supreme Court said the judge cannot review the records to make sure the Senate is not withholding records that should be released.\n\nIn concluding his ruling, Lopez noted that disputes over the 2020 election continue to be “a central focus of the political realm, a matter outside this Court’s constitutional prerogative.”\n\nHe said the ruling followed longstanding precedent preserving separation of powers and guards lawmaker’s ability to do their jobs without undue interference. And he said if the public does not like what they do, they have a way to deal with that.\n\n“Arizona legislators routinely stand for election and, thus, are accountable to the state’s electorate who serve as the ultimate arbiters of the wisdom of any legislative action, rather than the courts,” Lopez wrote.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/got-arizona-audit-timeline-002116065.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr', 'Headline': 'How we got here: An Arizona election audit timeline - Yahoo', 'Snippet': ""Debate over Arizona's 2020 election, in which Joe Biden's victory helped send him to the White House, has continued nearly nonstop for almost a year."", 'Full_text': 'The debate over Arizona\'s 2020 general election, in which Joe Biden\'s victory helped send him to the White House, has continued nearly nonstop for more than year.\n\nProtests and lawsuits were immediate.

Our reporters stay on top of it all. Subscribe now to azcentral.com.\n\n2020: A contentious election\n\nNov. 3: Election night tallies show Joe Biden defeating then-President Donald Trump in Arizona, although the race remains tight with many votes left to count. Trump says he plans to go to the U.S. Supreme Court to prevent states from counting outstanding ballots late into the night, which he calls a “fraud.” However, in Arizona, Trump says there are many votes left to count and that he shouldn\'t be discounted yet.\n\nNov. 4: Protests and election lawsuits begin. Some 100 people rally at the state Capitol. Republican State Rep. Kelly Townsend urges them to sign affidavits about their voting experience and to contact Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward. An election lawsuit related to the use of Sharpies is filed, despite election officials across Arizona saying the use of the felt-tip pen to fill out ballots is not a problem. The case is dropped three days later.\n\nToward evening, more people gather outside the Maricopa County election center as workers continue to count votes.\n\nRepublican Clint Hickman, chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and Supervisor Steve Gallardo, the board\'s only Democrat, issue a bipartisan request for patience, saying an accurate vote count takes time. ""It\'s possible the results you see now may change after all the votes are counted. This is evidence of democracy, not fraud.""\n\nNov. 5: Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones rallies people outside the county elections center in Phoenix. “The world is watching the example of Arizona, the president is watching the example, you’re not gonna let ‘em steal this,"" Jones tells the crowd.\n\nNov. 7: Arizona continues counting ballots, but Biden is projected to win Pennsylvania, which pushes him across the 270 electoral college threshold. Meanwhile, a pressure campaign on Maricopa County leaders by the state GOP chair begins. Text messages and voicemails reveal multipronged attempts by Ward to halt Trump’s impending loss in Arizona.\n\nNov. 13: Maricopa County completes its final count, showing Biden beat Trump. Hours later, Ward texts Hickman: “POTUS will probably be calling you.” Hickman later tells The Arizona Republic that the call didn\'t come until New Year\'s Eve, and he let the White House switchboard go to voicemail.\n\nNov. 22: State leaders face pressure, too. Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani call Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers. The pair expresses concerns about widespread election fraud and suggests Bowers can help, saying Arizona law allows the state Legislature — rather than voters — to choose its electors.\n\nBowers, when telling Arizona Republic reporters about the phone call months later, says he expressed skepticism and sought evidence. “You are giving me nothing but conjecture and asking me to break my oath and commit to doing something I cannot do because I swore I wouldn\'t. I will follow the Constitution,” he tells Trump and Giuliani.\n\nNov. 30: Giuliani and others gather in a downtown Phoenix hotel presenting election fraud theories. The goal seems to be to persuade Arizona legislators to intercede with the state\'s election results. At the Capitol, state officials officially certify the results showing Trump lost. Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican who campaigned with Trump, expresses confidence in the process. ""We do elections well here in Arizona,"" he says.\n\nDec. 1: Giuliani and other Trump allies, such as Jenna Ellis and retired Army Col. Phil Waldron, meet with Republican lawmakers, including Bowers and Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, in a state Senate meeting room. Ellis claims lawmakers can replace the state\'s 11 presidential electors, whose votes are supposed to go to Biden, with electors for Trump.\n\nBowers leaves the meeting underwhelmed by the fraud claims and unwilling to seek to replace electors. “We were being asked to do something huge, and we thought we were going to get the evidence at the meeting,” he later tells The Republic.\n\nDec. 4: Bowers and Fann issue a joint statement calling for an independent audit of Maricopa County’s Dominion Voting Systems software and voting machines. Bowers is looking to work cooperatively with the county and with accredited experts.\n\nOne America News personality Christina Bobb emails Fann on behalf of Giuliani offering what they viewed as pertinent information and a promise of continued contact. “Good morning, Ma’am,” Bobb writes. “Mayor Giuliani asked me to send you these declarations. He will follow up with you as well.”\n\nDec. 8: Bowers, Fann, Hickman and attorneys and staffers for all sides meet via Zoom to cooperatively discuss issues such as how ballots are counted, the status of election-related lawsuits and how an accredited firm could review Dominion Voting Systems software and voting machines.\n\nDec. 9: Bowers and Fann acknowledge to each other that members of the GOP caucuses want public hearings. Bowers would later relay to The Republic that he is concerned about adding to ""the circus,"" but Fann says they need to do something. Bowers agrees to a joint House-Senate committee hearing on one condition: No subpoenas would demand the county produce information. He wants to work cooperatively with county officials rather than to create a legal battle.\n\nMeanwhile, thinking the last of at least eight unsuccessful election lawsuits is over, the Board of Supervisors brings in two officials from Pro V&V, an Alabama company accredited by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, to examine the Dominion machines. While they are in the air, Hickman learns that Ward, the state GOP chair, will appeal her case. The pair fly out of Phoenix the next day as the county, during litigation, doesn\'t want anyone to touch the machines, which could be considered evidence.\n\nDec. 10: Fann and state Sen. Eddie Farnsworth, R-Gilbert, a longtime friend of Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, an outspoken Trump ally, meet with county representatives without Bowers and the House. The senators tell county staff they intend to hold an election-related hearing without the House and raise the issue of subpoenas. Ahead of the hearing, Fann tells Bowers her caucus is moving ahead on its own. “OK. Good luck,” he recalls telling her. Bowers tells The Republic that Fann\'s decision is one of the ""nagging mysteries,"" saying he has no idea why she shifted away from a cooperative, joint audit.\n\nDec. 14: County officials spend the day answering questions at the Senate hearing. At the end, Farnsworth announces he will issue subpoenas.\n\nDec. 15: Arizona Senate Republican leaders send subpoenas to Maricopa County for all ballots cast in the November election, voting machines, voter rolls and more information for ""forensic analysis."" One of the demands is for ""ranked-choice voting,"" which is not something Arizona uses. This suggests that Farnsworth did not write the subpoenas.\n\nDec. 17: Bowers texts Hickman to express his disappointment with the Senate\'s approach. The county supervisor responds: ""Thank you for sticking with us. It’s called rational leadership in irrational times and I am positive history will be kind to us.”\n\nDec. 18: The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors files suit to fight the subpoenas, saying they are too broad and would violate voters\' privacy.\n\nDec. 24: Giuliani calls County Supervisor Jack Sellers. “I’m hoping we could have a chance to have a conversation,” a transcription of Giuliani’s message to Sellers says. “I’d like to see if there’s a way that we can resolve this so that it comes out well for everyone. We’re all Republicans, I think we have the same goal. … Let’s see if we can get this done outside of the court, gosh.” Sellers does not return the call.\n\n2021: The ballot recount and more\n\nJan. 6: Biggs calls Bowers and asks if he would support decertifying Arizona\'s electors. Bowers says he would not. Later that day, Biggs stands on the floor of the House of Representatives and urges his colleagues to set aside electors from Arizona, Georgia and other states. Before the House votes to reject Biggs’ arguments, hundreds of Trump supporters break into the U.S. Capitol, sparking a deadly riot.\n\nJan. 12: With the start of new legislative terms, Fann and state Sen. Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert, who replaced the retired Farnsworth as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, reissue a subpoena to the county for its ballots and election equipment.\n\nJan. 27: The county\'s Board of Supervisors votes to conduct an audit to try to put election integrity concerns to rest, but Fann says it doesn\'t go far enough.\n\nFeb. 5: Fann communicates with Doug Logan, who owns a small cybersecurity firm in Florida called Cyber Ninjas. This early communication would become publicly known months later in response to a public records request. Logan, at this point, already was working with Trump allies to uncover election fraud.\n\nFeb. 8: The Arizona Senate votes on whether to hold the Board of Supervisors in contempt for not fully responding to the subpoenas. Such a vote could lead to the arrest of the county\'s elected supervisors. Amid tensions leading up to the vote, Hickman tells the Senate chief of staff of protests at his home — one that drew 90 angry people and evoked fears of the riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThat morning, state Sen. Paul Boyer, R-Glendale, and Supervisors Bill Gates and Sellers gather in Fann’s office. Gates lays out his case: The supervisors were in court over the subpoenas, seeking direction from a judge. By the county’s reading of the law, the ballots and machines had to remain locked up for a certain period after the election. Either way, he says, the county needed clarity from the court, and a judge would decide soon.\n\n“We’re in court to get direction,"" Gates remembers saying. ""You don’t need to do this. Why would you?” Fann says no one will get jailed and that it is a procedural move to compel information. She takes the contempt charge to a vote on the Senate floor. Boyer is the lone Republican to vote against it, leading to its defeat.\n\n“My no vote today will give the board time to resolve itself on how to legally proceed with providing these public records for independent sunshine and scrutiny, while also providing 100% protection for the private nature of an individual’s vote,"" Boyer says.\n\nFeb. 23: Auditors hired by the county found no malicious hardware on voting machines, the machines were not connected to the internet, and the machines were programmed to tabulate ballots accurately.\n\nFeb. 26: Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Timothy Thomason rules the legislative subpoenas are valid. County officials say they will work to provide the materials.\n\nFeb. 27: Fann sends a text message to Waldron, the retired Army colonel and Trump ally who cast himself as an election-security expert, to inquire about Logan, the Cyber Ninjas CEO. Fann says she felt ""more comfortable"" after Waldron vouched for Logan.\n\nMarch 10: Hundreds of people flock to Queen Creek, southeast of Phoenix, for an event promoted by the Arizona Republican Party: ""The Mike Lindell Election Integrity, Faith and Freedom” event, which was sponsored by We the People Alliance AZ. “Arizona is going to pave the way,” Lindell, the CEO of My Pillow and an ardent Trump supporter, says to cheers. “We are chosen for such a time as this by God.”\n\nMarch 31: Fann announces Cyber Ninjas will lead the Senate\'s audit. The firm has no election auditing experience, but Logan has touted widespread election fraud claims on social media. Election experts say the $150,000 price tag is too low and raises concerns about partisanship, the time frame and the lack of transparency.\n\nApril 22: The Arizona Democratic Party and county Supervisor Gallardo sue to stop the audit because of security and other concerns. The lawsuit is filed the same day the county begins delivering the ballots, voting machines and other requested materials to Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix, which is leased for the hand recount.\n\nApril 23: Journalists initially are denied entry to observe the audit unless they sign up as a volunteer observer. The recount begins with one reporter in the coliseum who signed up to work a six-hour shift as a volunteer observer. The Republic\'s Jen Fifield questions Cyber Ninjas\' CEO about blue pens she spots on the recount tables. Voting machines can read black and blue ink, which is why recounts should use an alternative color. After checking, Logan has blue pens removed and replaced with green pens before any real ballots are taken out of the boxes.\n\nMaricopa County Superior Court Judge Christopher Coury, concerned by uncertainties about the audit procedures, orders the Arizona Senate to ""pause"" its recount if the state Democratic Party, which asked for the halt, posts a $1 million bond to cover any costs from the delay. The Democratic Party does not post the bond, and the audit continues.\n\nApril 27: Local journalists obtain limited access to the coliseum during the recount.\n\nApril 28: A judge requires Cyber Ninjas to provide the audit procedures it fought to keep secret.\n\nApril 30: Republic reporter Ryan Randazzo is removed from the coliseum and told his press privileges are revoked after posting a photo showing a former Republican legislator at a ballot-counting table. The photo shows a ballot, with no markings discernible, on a vertical stand in front of former state Rep. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale. The Senate later reverses its revocation of Randazzo\'s access.\n\nMay 5: The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division sends a letter questioning the Arizona Senate about the audit’s security and potential for voter intimidation.\n\nMay 6: The Republic reports that efforts to recruit people to recount ballots appear targeted in part at traditionally conservative groups — and some of the recruiters have far-right political ties.\n\nMay 7: Fann drops a controversial plan to go door to door to ask local residents about their voting history as part of its audit. The decision to halt the canvassing portion of the audit is in response to the DOJ\'s inquiry.\n\nMay 7: Maricopa County officials refuse to provide access to its computer routers. Sheriff Paul Penzone calls the demand ""mind-numbingly reckless and irresponsible,"" saying it could compromise law enforcement data.\n\nMay 12: Fann asks county officials to meet to answer questions, saying she wants to ""constructively resolve these issues and questions without recourse to additional subpoenas or other compulsory process."" The audit\'s Twitter account strikes a different tone, accusing the county of deleting election databases and spoliation of evidence.\n\nMay 14: The original deadline to complete the hand recount comes and goes. The Senate has extended its coliseum lease through June 30.\n\nMay 15: Trump alleges, among other things, ""The entire Database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been DELETED!"" and calls it an ""election crime."" Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican elected in November, responds on Twitter: ""Wow. This is unhinged. I’m literally looking at our voter registration database on my other screen. Right now.""\n\nMay 17: Sellers blasts Fann for trying to legitimize ""a grift disguised as an audit."" As for the files Fann said were missing, the county says contractors likely failed to properly download or search the county\'s databases, which made it so database and directories appeared to be missing. ""We wouldn’t be asked to do this on-the-job training if qualified auditors had been hired to do this work,"" Sellers says. The Senate\'s contractors would later tell Fann that they found the files in question.\n\nMay 20: Arizona\'s top election official, Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, says she may not allow the county to reuse hundreds of vote-counting machines provided, after a subpoena, to Fann\'s contractors. Replacing the machines could cost millions.\n\nMay 22: An email obtained by The Republic shows a nonprofit started by former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne will handle background checks, nondisclosure agreements and volunteer agreements of audit workers. Byrne\'s nonprofit also is raising money for the audit. Byrne wrote ""The Deep Rig,"" a book turned movie claiming election fraud.\n\nMay 24: Scottsdale-based technology company StratTech Solutions takes over running the hand count when Pennsylvania-based Wake TSI doesn\'t renew its contract past May 14.\n\nJune 2: The audit is a boon to the Arizona Republican Party, which has raised far more money this year than it did at this point last year, The Republic reports. Leaders in other states are paying attention. Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a Republican, visits the coliseum with colleagues and says he wants an Arizona-style audit in his state. Others from states such as Alaska, Wisconsin and Georgia follow.\n\nJune 3: Maricopa County election data is in a ""secure lab"" in Montana, or maybe a log cabin in the woods. The Republic reports that a contractor hired by the Arizona Senate is reviewing the election data from an undisclosed location in Montana, with no oversight from state or county officials.\n\nJune 26: The CEO of the company leading the audit appears in a new movie called ""The Deep Rig"" that asserts the election was stolen from Trump. ""If we don’t fix our election integrity now, we may no longer have a democracy,"" Logan says in the film that premiered in Phoenix. The film is based on a book by Byrne and features former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nJune 28: Maricopa County will not reuse voting machines that were in the custody of the Senate\'s contractors. The county Board of Supervisors sends a letter to the Arizona secretary of state that the board shares her concerns about whether the hundreds of vote-counting machines that they had to give the Senate\'s contractors are safe to use, in part considering the contractors are not certified to handle election equipment in the U.S.\n\nJune 30: The Republic files a special action in Maricopa County Superior Court seeking financial records and communications about the audit from the Senate and lead contractor Cyber Ninjas.\n\nJuly 1: The county\'s ballots and voting machines are moved out of the coliseum as the Senate\'s lease ends and into a swamp-cooled building at the state fairgrounds.\n\nJuly 8: Fann says the Senate will conduct its own recount of the total number of county ballots cast in the general election. The Senate purchased two paper-counting machines to serve as a check on the work done by its contractor and county elections officials. But the attorney hired by the Cyber Ninjas to help run its audit is now helping the Senate with its check, raising questions about its independence.\n\nJuly 14: County supervisors vote to spend $2.8 million to buy new voting equipment to replace the machines that were in custody of the Senate\'s contractors during the review.\n\nJuly 15: Logan meets with Fann and Petersen in a public hearing to share some of his findings and what he needs to complete the review, including the county\'s routers.\n\nJuly 23: A thunderstorm leads to a leaky roof at the state fairgrounds building where the review continues. Workers quickly move ballot boxes away from the leaks and cover boxes with tarps. ""No ballots are at risk,"" an audit spokesperson says.\n\nJuly 23: Ken Bennett, whom state Senate leaders put in charge as their liaison to the election review, is banned from the building where the work is happening and weighs stepping down. The decision to block Bennett came after learning he secretly shared initial results from a new ballot count with an outside group, according to Randy Pullen, another Senate spokesperson and former chairman of the state GOP. Bennett eventually regains access and continues in his role.\n\nJuly 26: GOP Senate leaders file another subpoena for the county\'s routers and other election items. They also issue a subpoena to Dominion Voting Systems for user names, passwords, tokens and pins to its machines.\n\nJuly 29: Workers at the state fairgrounds load nearly 2.1 million ballots onto trucks and return them to the county, ending the more than three-month process of reviewing ballots and other election equipment. And Cyber Ninjas releases long-sought details on who funded the audit, which was far pricier than the $150,000 that the state Senate agreed to pay. A handful of nonprofits whose leaders pushed the election fraud narrative have poured more than $5.6 million into the audit so far. Among the leaders are Byrne, Flynn, former Trump attorney Sidney Powell and far-right One America News Network correspondent Christina Bobb.\n\nAug. 2: County supervisors and Dominion Voting Systems refuse to produce election materials in response to the Senate\'s new subpoenas. ""The board has real work to do and little time to entertain this adventure in never-never land,"" Sellers says.\n\nAug. 5: Fann and other Republicans in her caucus are fighting to keep secret the records of the audit despite a judge\'s order that they ""immediately"" hand over all communications related to the effort.\n\nAug. 18: County supervisors lodge a notice of claim with the Arizona Senate for more than $2.8 million it spent replacing vote-counting machines that were potentially compromised as a result of the election review.\n\nAug. 23: The Cyber Ninjas\' draft report is expected this day, but instead, Fann announces Logan and several members of his team are sick with COVID-19.\n\nAug. 26: Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich says the county could lose millions in state-shared funding if it doesn\'t turn over routers the state Senate subpoenaed.\n\nAug. 30: Fann had put canvassing on hold as part of the audit, but a local group continues its efforts to go door to door to learn more about voters. Chandler real estate agent Liz Harris has led a canvassing effort known as the “Voter Integrity Project” since December, mobilizing thousands of volunteers, The Republic reports.\n\nAug. 31: The Arizona Senate releases texts and emails that offer glimpses into the audit but withholds thousands of other documents. Two judges had ordered the Senate to turn over the records. The documents show Cleta Mitchell, a prominent Republican attorney who advised Trump as he tried to overturn the 2020 election, helped set up an escrow account to funnel money to companies working on the audit. The documents also show the state Senate hired Shiva Ayyadurai, a conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine activist, to review voter signatures on the county\'s mail-in ballot envelopes.\n\nSept. 3: The Republic reports Arizona taxpayers have footed nearly $425,000 for the costs of the audit Senate Republicans are conducting, with thousands of dollars more in bills yet to come. The largest expense is for $223,000 in legal fees paid through July, followed by $68,100 for security costs at the state fairgrounds in May, state records show.\n\nSept. 15: Fann directs the CEO of Cyber Ninjas to turn over all communications related to the election audit after the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a lower court\'s order for the Senate to make the Cyber Ninjas\' documents public as part of a public-record lawsuit. The Republic and a left-leaning watchdog group called American Oversight both sued the Senate when Fann and the other members did not grant requests for emails, texts and other communications concerning the audit.\n\nSept. 16: Fann says the Arizona Senate will receive the audit report at 1 p.m. Sept. 24.\n\nSept. 17: County supervisors and state Senate leaders strike a settlement related to reviewing the county\'s routers as part of the election review. The county raised security concerns about giving the Senate\'s contractors access to the routers. Under the deal, the contractors will not have access to the routers, but the county will hire former U.S. Rep. John Shadegg to answer the Senate\'s questions about the routers. The county also agrees to no longer seek Senate repayment for potentially compromised voting machines.\n\nSept. 22: County Supervisor Steve Chucri announces he will resign after recordings surface of him talking about the 2020 election and his county colleagues. In the leaked recordings, Chucri bashed other supervisors for their lack of support for the Senate\'s audit and indicated he thought there were fraudulent votes cast in the election. Chucri, in announcing his resignation, said the comments were made at a ""very turbulent time"" and that ""the election was not stolen. (Joe) Biden won.""\n\nSept. 23: An early version of the Cyber Ninjas\' report obtained by The Republic shows that the hand recount confirmed what was announced in November: Biden won. The draft reports reviewed by The Republic minimize the ballot counts and instead focus on issues that raise questions about the election process and voter integrity. Meanwhile, American Oversight asks a judge to find the Arizona Senate in contempt of a court order for not turning over Cyber Ninjas\' emails and other records from the election audit.\n\nSept. 24: Results of the election review are presented to the Arizona Senate Republicans who ordered it. Election conspiracists loyal to Trump had believed a thorough review would show county elections officials didn\'t get it right, but Fann dashes their hopes. She confirms in her opening remarks the hand recount of ballots shows Biden won the election in Maricopa County, cementing his win in Arizona. “That is a true statement,"" Fann says as a packed audience in the Senate gallery listens quietly.\n\nShe adds, though, that she believes there were ""broken statutes"" and flawed election procedures — issues she will turn over to the state attorney general to investigate. In a letter to Brnovich, Fann says the Senate is already working on legislation to ensure Arizona has “an unimpeachable election process.”\n\nSept. 26: Election experts say the Arizona Senate had a chance to do something extraordinary when it set out to audit the county\'s election results but instead hired partisan contractors who didn\'t have knowledge of elections and used questionable methods. The results, they say, did nothing to strengthen elections. The Senate\'s election review only sows doubts — just as it was designed to do, they say.\n\nSept. 28: Arizona Attorney General Brnovich, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate, takes initial steps to investigate the 2020 presidential election, directing the county to hold onto records and asking the Senate to share evidence gathered by its contractors.\n\nMeanwhile, the results of the election review don\'t stop misinformation. A far-right news outlet, Gateway Pundit, publishes a doctored version of the Cyber Ninjas\' draft report saying Maricopa County\'s election should be decertified. Logan, who led the ballot review, told The Republic he never recommended decertifying the county\'s election.\n\nNov. 1: Fann announces she will retire from the Legislature when her current term ends in January 2023.\n\nNov. 15: Three nationally recognized election experts issue a report saying Cyber Ninjas\' hand count cannot be validated or replicated. Their report comes after reviewing tallies on every vote counted by the Cyber Ninjas. The Senate on Nov. 1 released nearly 80,000 images of tally sheets related to the hand count. ""We have tried dozens of ways to include and exclude various boxes and batches to arrive at those precise figures and have been unable to replicate their announced results,"" The Audit Guys write. Logan calls the claims ""outlandish,"" false and libelous. Logan does not respond to questions about the report or identify anything in it that he considered untrue.\n\nNov. 23: Boyer, who cast the deciding vote against holding the Board of Supervisors in contempt for not responding fully to the Senate subpoenas, says he will leave the Legislature when his term expires in January 2023. The Glendale Republican describes a ""toxic"" atmosphere at the Capitol and says he\'s lost the enthusiasm to seek a third Senate term amid what was likely to be a bruising primary challenge.\n\nDec. 22: Public-records lawsuits filed by the nonprofit organization American Oversight and another filed by The Arizona Republic continue to be heard in Arizona courts. Every ruling in the cases has ordered Cyber Ninjas to turn over records with a nexus to the audit, but the firm thus far has failed to do so.\n\nCyber Ninjas, in addition to arguing unsuccessfully that audit-related documents are not public records, contends it can\'t afford the cost of producing records, nor the cost of preparing a detailed log of redacted items. The Republic\'s attorney, David Bodney, sent a letter to Cyber Ninjas\' law firm warning that The Republic likely will seek legal fees not only from Cyber Ninjas but from their lawyers as well because they continue to withhold the records.\n\n""Cyber Ninjas’ flouting of the Arizona Public Records Law has been enabled through its assertion of meritless legal positions, its disobedience of court orders, its repetition of rejected legal theories, and its interpretation of those orders in a manner that twists them beyond recognition,"" Bodney wrote.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2023/06/12/new-cyber-ninjas-text-2021-arizona-audit/70299020007/', 'Headline': ""Why new texts about what happened at 2021 Arizona 'audit' matter"", 'Snippet': ""What 'findings' did Cyber Ninjas report to the Senate? Logan announced the results of the hand count on Sept. 24, 2021. He reported Joe Biden won the presidential election in Arizona."", 'Full_text': 'The truth behind the Arizona Senate\'s ""audit"" of 2020 election results is emerging in thousands of private text messages from Cyber Ninjas\' CEO Doug Logan.\n\nThe texts undermine claims the ""audit"" was a nonpartisan effort to ensure the accuracy of election results, revealing it was part of a multi-state effort by allies of former President Donald Trump to restore him to office.\n\nLogan\'s messages show the work of hundreds of volunteers − who spent two months in 2021 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum reviewing ballots and recording individual votes onto more than 70,000 tally sheets − couldn\'t even be counted.\n\nHere\'s the latest on Logan, his texts and the review of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County.\n\nWhat was reason behind the Arizona \'audit\'?\n\nSenate Republicans in 2021 announced they would commission a hand count of every ballot cast in Maricopa County to address claims the election had been stolen from Trump. The Senate subpoenaed the ballots and other election material from the county.\n\nSenate President Karen Fann hired the Cyber Ninjas to lead the hand count. Although neither Logan nor his company had election auditing experience, Fann at the time said he was ""well qualified"" and ""well experienced."" The review was supposed to take a few weeks and cost taxpayers $150,000.\n\nIt would take about two months and cost Arizona millions of dollars.\n\nWhat \'findings\' did Cyber Ninjas report to the Senate?\n\nLogan announced the results of the hand count on Sept. 24, 2021. He reported Joe Biden won the presidential election in Arizona. Logan\'s tally differed from the county\'s official results by 994 votes.\n\nLogan\'s report skimmed over Biden\'s win and raised a host of ""anomalies"" that continued to raise doubts about the election process. It left lawmakers, partisan contractors and Trump allies calling for more audits, the rejection of voting machines and new voter integrity laws to prevent fraud at the polls.\n\nFull story: \'Our numbers are screwy\': Cyber Ninjas CEO admits he couldn\'t tally hand count of ballots\n\nDo Logan\'s private texts contradict his public statements?\n\nYes. In hundreds of recently released texts from the summer of 2021, Logan admitted he couldn\'t make sense of his own data. Days after the hand count ended, Logan confirmed he had no way to tally the results.\n\n""How plausible is this solution looking? I looped back to look through all of the aggregation data again. It (is) pretty broken. A lot of it doesn\'t make any sense,"" Logan wrote in a July 5, 2021, text.\n\nDid Logan say, \'Our numbers are screwy?\'\n\nHe did. Even after he turned over his numbers to Arizona Senate Republicans ― 11 days before the Senate hearing ― Logan was trying to reconcile his own data, with no success.\n\n""Reading through that summary doc on President vs. Senate. Looks like basically our numbers are screwy,"" he said in a Sept. 13 text message.\n\nWhat is Logan\'s response to this?\n\nHe has not responded to repeated interview requests from The Arizona Republic. He has declined to answer specific questions about his text messages or his activities.\n\nHow did the Cyber Ninjas fix the numbers problem?\n\nTexts show they didn\'t. For weeks, Logan tried unsuccessfully to tally more than 70,000 sheets where volunteers recorded individual votes with tick marks. He worked with a technology expert named Mike Piehota, but they couldn\'t come up with a computer system to read the marks.\n\n""To cut to the chase, it\'s my opinion we\'re not going to be able to accurately process tally sheets using current text recognition technology,"" Piehota wrote in a July 6 text. ""Ultimately, we need to consider a different approach if you want to revisit tally sheets in the short term. Other than a massive manual effort, I don\'t have a good answer.""\n\nLogan replied minutes later: ""I don\'t care if we have to hand-write in the batch number, etc. As long as the tally is correct most of the time.""\n\nDid Cyber Ninjas make up numbers?\n\nLogan\'s texts show how his team shifted away from trying to quantify the hand count and sought other means to deliver plausible numbers to the Senate.\n\nThey first tried counting votes by scanning tally sheets. They couldn\'t get a software program to read the tick marks. Then they focused on counting the total number of ballots, scouring county electronic tabulation records, creating worksheets and databases and weighing ballot boxes on scales.\n\nThe texts indicate they failed at these efforts.\n\nIs that why the Senate brought in machines to count ballots?\n\nNeither Logan nor the Senate issued any public statements about the inability to quantify the results of the hand count.\n\nThe hand count ended on June 25, 2021. Days later, Fann said Logan\'s hand count of ballots were far off Maricopa County\'s official results. Fann on July 8 said the Senate had purchased two machine counters as a way to ""triple check"" the numbers.\n\nShe did not disclose the number Logan provided.\n\nWas the Arizona \'audit\' part of a larger election scheme?\n\nThe text messages show Logan already was part of a coordinated effort to overturn 2020 election results in several swing states when he was tapped to lead the Arizona Senate\'s partisan ""audit,"" records show.\n\nThousands of text messages to and from Logan show he worked closely with allies of then-President Donald Trump as they plotted to challenge outcomes in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nTexts show that Fann privately communicated with Logan in February 2021, likely on a recommendation from retired Army Col. Phil Waldron, an ardent Trump supporter and election conspiracy theorist. She publicly named Logan as the audit leader on March 31, 2021.\n\nFull story: Arizona \'audit\' leader traded messages with dozens of \'Stop the Steal\' partisans, texts show\n\nWhen did Logan start strategizing with Trump allies?\n\nLess than two weeks after Trump lost the November 2020 election, Logan was invited to pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood\'s plantation properties in South Carolina to map out ways for challenging election results in swing states, texts and court records show.\n\nLogan testified in a Georgia civil elections case last year that he stayed at the plantation for about six weeks, from Nov. 14 until Dec. 24, rubbing shoulders with members of Trump\'s legal team and other loyalists.\n\nWho on Team Trump helped Logan?\n\nThe strategy meetings involved a who\'s who of Trumpworld conspiracy theorists, cyber specialists, lawyers, retired government officials and some Republican state lawmakers.\n\nThe group included Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, former National Security Agency official Jim Penrose, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Former Army Capt. Seth Keshel.\n\nAll later would participate in the Maricopa County ballot review. They helped Logan raise millions for the ""audit,"" helped him write reports and offered logistical support, texts and court records show.\n\nAre authorities investigating Logan?\n\nLogan was involved in multiple breaches of voting equipment in Georgia and Michigan in the weeks leading up to the Arizona ""audit,"" texts and court records show.\n\nIn January 2021, he and others were captured on video surveillance heading into an elections office in Coffee County, Georgia, where authorities said voting equipment was breached. He has not been charged there.\n\nLogan is under investigation by Michigan authorities for illegally accessing and dismantling voting machines in April 2021 as part of a plot to prove the election was rigged. He has not been charged there.\n\nHow did The Republic get Logan\'s text messages?\n\nThe Republic in June 2021 requested emails, text messages and all other communications from Cyber Ninjas and the Senate. When they refused, The Republic filed lawsuits alleging violations of the Arizona Pubic Records Law.\n\nA judge in January 2022 ordered Logan to turn over all records and communications related to the audit and fined his company $50,000 a day until he complied. The fines now total more than $5 million.\n\nIs Logan still withholding records?\n\nYes. Logan has turned over texts in haphazard, nonsequential batches and in different formats, so threads were broken and not easily searchable. The messages, released in November and December 2022 and February and March 2023, were not organized chronologically or in any other discernable order.\n\nAnd while Logan has released more than 39,000 text messages, he has redacted 3,000 more without explanation and in apparent violation of court orders.\n\nHow did you make sense of 39,000 text messages?\n\nAn independent team of nationally recognized data analysts known as The Audit Guys built software to untangle and organize the messages.\n\nThe Audit Guys have long challenged Logan\'s ballot review as ""fiction"" and after an exhaustive analysis of data in 2021 concluded that Logan\'s ""results"" were wildly inaccurate and made up.\n\nAfter consolidating the texts in a searchable database, The Audit Guys determined Logan at one time omitted about 4,000 messages from his side of conversations and duplicated 5,500 in multiple batches. They have identified gaps in messages, blank and redacted texts and references to messaging systems that Logan never turned over.\n\nWho are The Audit Guys?\n\nThe Audit Guys are Larry Moore, the founder of Boston-based election technology company Clear Ballot Group; Benny White, a prominent Pima County Republican data analyst; and Tim Halvorsen, Clear Ballot\'s retired chief technology officer.\n\nTheir stated mission is to ""debunk election disinformation and confront those who use their power to spread it.""\n\nWhy does the hand count matter two years later?\n\nLogan\'s findings allowed Trump allies to insist the vote was compromised. Its immediate aftermath was to further instill distrust in voting machines and encourage partisan calls for paper ballot tabulations, hand recounts and ""audits."" They have also called for an end to early voting.\n\nWith the 2024 election around the corner, many partisan actors claim without evidence that machine tabulated ballots are rife with fraud. And they insist the only way to prevent fraud is through a hand count of ballots.\n\nLook no farther than Cochise County, where Republican officials in 2022 sought to delay certification of the election until after commissioning a full hand count, which was blocked by the courts.\n\nA judge in April fined two Cochise County supervisors $37,000 in legal and court fees for failing to follow state elections procedures.\n\nHow much has the Arizona \'audit\' cost taxpayers?\n\nTaxpayer costs are about $5 million so far. That includes $518,000 Maricopa County spent in its fight with Senate Republicans over access to its voting equipment and related records and $3.2 million for new voting machines. The Senate has spent at least $1.1 million, of which about half has been spent on legal fees.\n\nIn addition to the public costs, Cyber Ninjas received at least $6.7 million from private donors. The firm last year said it had lost at least $2 million, according to a financial statement shared with the Senate.\n\nCyber Ninjas has since gone out of business'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.courthousenews.com/arizona-supreme-court-to-determine-if-the-public-has-a-right-to-access-cyber-ninja-related-audit-records/', 'Headline': 'Arizona justices to decide if public has right to see Cyber Ninja ...', 'Snippet': 'The audit is recounting voter ballots and retesting ballot tabulation machines.” Kory Langhofer, an attorney for Fann and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Warren Petersen, argued that the Legislature has broad powers and a duty to safeguard elections.

A narrow majority of Arizonans voted for Biden.\n\nMayes has kept details of her investigators’ work closely guarded, but the email indicates that pursuing the electors is a foremost priority.\n\nProsecutors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada have brought charges against slates of electors there. Mayes, a Democrat who took office in January, has said her comparably short time in office was a reason her case was ongoing.\n\n'It just tells me that it's not on the front burner'\n\nThe new information about Mayes’ inquiry was included in an email to Benny White, one of a trio of data experts known as The Audit Guys who have debunked and widely criticized the Senate Republicans’ ballot review of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nLogan led the ballot review and more recently was an unnamed, unindicted co-conspirator in Georgia's sweeping criminal case that alleges Trump and 18 others engaged in a plot to overturn Trump's loss there. Evidence shows that Logan worked closely with those in Trump’s orbit in a plan to subvert election results in several of the states that had false electors.\n\nWhite shared the email with The Arizona Republic, citing frustration that law enforcement leaders won’t speak more openly about what they are pursuing.\n\n“I think people have a right to know what the AG’s office is doing,” he said, later expressing concern that an inquiry into Logan’s role did not appear to be imminent.\n\n“It just tells me that it's not on the front burner, and it may not be on the burner at all,” said White, a Pima County Republican data analyst.\n\nWhite said he had been meeting and communicating via email with investigators in Mayes' office since summer. He said he sent investigators a report from The Audit Guys that suggests Logan could face charges of obstruction or contempt.\n\n“My purpose in doing that was to try to put a wedge into their thinking up there in Phoenix that they still needed to take a look at what happened in the so-called forensic audit,” he said. “Because, to me, it appears that there were numerous violations of both federal law and state law and nobody had been held accountable.”\n\nIn a Dec. 13 email to James Cope, chief special agent in the criminal division of Mayes’ office, White asked for a meeting with Mayes’ deputy to discuss Logan’s role.\n\nCope responded that his boss Nick Klingerman “stated that we won’t be able to look at Logan until we finish with the current” case involving the electors.\n\n“I think we will be tied up on this until March,” Cope wrote to White.\n\nKlingerman is the chief of the criminal division.\n\nMayes knocks Brnovich, calls for 'seeing where the facts take us'\n\nThe Arizona Republic has previously reported Mayes' inquiry could include the Arizona Senate recount of 2.1 million Maricopa County ballots led by Cyber Ninjas. Prominent former Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley has also called on county and state authorities to investigate Logan.\n\nA spokesperson for Mayes declined to comment Monday on the email.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview last week, Mayes would not provide details about the scope of her team’s inquiry. She also declined to share details from a meeting her investigators held with former Trump campaign attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who wrote memos outlining how electors could help overturn the result.\n\n“I'm just not going to talk about any potential witnesses or individuals that we may have spoken to as part of the investigation,” Mayes said. “It's just really important to me that this be a professional investigation that doesn't include the kinds of midstream updates that my predecessor was providing.”\n\nMayes has often criticized former Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, for politicizing the office under his tenure.\n\nIn April 2022, while under political pressure from his party’s Trump allies to act, Brnovich released an “interim” report based on his review of the Cyber Ninjas’ findings. Brnovich’s report found “serious vulnerabilities” in elections but was widely criticized as politically motivated and debunked by county officials.\n\nMayes told reporters in August that her office's investigation was focused on the fake electors, but confirmed it could widen. Subsequent reporting by The Washington Post in October showed Mayes’ investigators cast a wider net, interviewing former House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Mesa Republican, and current and former Republican Maricopa County supervisors about the pressure campaign Trump and his allies exerted in the Grand Canyon State.\n\nAsked about the scope of her office’s investigation last week, Mayes again declined to provide specifics.\n\nShe said she did not “want to artificially narrow it or broaden it, because I think this is really about letting the investigators do their work, letting the lawyers do their work, and seeing where the facts take us.”\n\nRelated: Here's how presidential candidates will be listed on Arizona's preference election ballots\n\nWithout consequences, White warns: 'They’ll do it again in '24'\n\nWhite and his nationally recognized team — The Audit Guys — have analyzed thousands of private messages from Logan that were obtained by The Republic through lawsuits under Arizona Public Records Law.\n\nThe trio built software to organize the messages that they shared with investigators in Arizona and other swing states, White said.\n\nWith no experience auditing elections, Logan and his company were hired in 2021 by then-Senate President Karen Fann, a Prescott Republican. The company's resulting report confirmed Biden’s win but raised issues with “anomalies” in the election. Those claims continue to fuel doubt in elections and serve as talking points for GOP politicians faithful to Trump’s assault on elections.\n\nLogan admitted in messages the audit’s numbers were “screwy.” The trove of messages also revealed Logan was part of a coordinated effort to overturn election results in several swing states when he was hired by the Arizona Senate.\n\nWhite said he believes Logan could be a key source of evidence against power players in Trump’s orbit and the overarching conspiracy to overturn the election.\n\nWithout repercussions, “they’ll do it again in '24,” White said.\n\n“We’ll see all the same actors, we’ll see the same tricks, and disinformation and frivolous lawsuits, and we'll go through another year or two years or three years of this nonsense,” he said.""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-supreme-court-makes-ruling-on-maricopa-county-2020-election-audit-lawsuit', 'Headline': 'Arizona Supreme Court makes ruling on Maricopa County 2020 election ...', 'Snippet': 'The Arizona Supreme Court has issued an opinion on a lawsuit concerning whether the state Senate has the authority to withhold 2020 election audit records from the public.', 'Full_text': 'The Arizona Supreme Court ruled on Aug. 31 that the state Senate can keep hundreds of secret emails and other records related to its partisan review of the 2020 election because they are ""privileged"" and exempt from disclosure under state public records law.\n\nThe unanimous ruling means the public will likely never know much of what Republican Senate President Karen Fann and GOP Sen. Warren Petersen, who heads the judiciary committee, were telling Doug Logan and others involved in the ""audit.""\n\nLogan heads Cyber Ninjas, the inexperienced firm the Senate hired to oversee the audit of computers and ballot counting machines and recount by hand 2.1 million ballots cast in 2020′s election in Maricopa County.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s win led former President Donald Trump to allege without evidence that he lost in Arizona and other battleground states because of fraud. The Senate then launched the review, which found the ballot count results were true.\n\nLogan’s report did raise a series of other claims about potential problems with the election, most since disproven. They include the potential for election equipment to be connected to the internet or that large numbers of ballots were cast by dead voters.\n\nThe ruling written by Justice John Lopez says legislative privilege applies because the audit was part of an investigation that could conceivably lead to new election laws. That is enough to shield the approximately 1,000 emails, text messages and other communications the Senate refused to release.\n\n""The Audit is a legislative activity within the legislature’s authority, and communications concerning this activity are covered by legislative privilege,"" Lopez wrote. ""Consequently, the Senate’s internal communications concerning the authorization, planning, and findings of the Audit investigation are privileged.""\n\nContinuing Coverage: Arizona Election Audit\n\nThe ruling overturns both a trial court judge and the state court of appeals, which took narrow views of legislative privilege and held that the public had a right to know what senators discussed about the audit.\n\n""It’s a win for the Senate on every issue unanimously,"" said Kory Langhofer, the Senate’s lawyer. ""It couldn’t be a better ruling.""\n\nThe Senate will have to reveal any records that are political in nature or involve the administration of the audit itself, but the Senate had already agreed to do that.\n\nFann said in a statement that the Senate’s position that the records could be kept secret was supported by ""decades of precedent"" from state and federal courts.\n\n""We absolutely believe in transparency, however, there are times when legislative privilege should be exercised so that we can do the jobs that the people of Arizona elected us to carry out,"" Fann said.\n\nThe public records lawsuit the court decided was filed by a watchdog group called American Oversight, which pushes for government transparency, shortly after the audit was launched in spring 2021.\n\nThe Senate disclosed more than 20,000 records after court orders prompted by lawsuits filed by American Oversight and the Arizona Republic, orders that the Supreme Court refused to block last year. But it withheld all or part of about 1,000 other documents, citing legislative privilege meant to promote robust debate among elected officials.\n\nThe court of appeals said privilege did not apply because the audit was mainly political, no legislation was being considered and the Senate failed to show releasing the documents would impair its deliberations. The Supreme Court rejected those findings, which American Oversight said will keep important information hidden from public view.\n\n""While legislative privilege should protect legitimate functions of the legislature, extending the privilege to activities that the Court recognized as uniquely politicized is misguided,"" American Oversight Executive Director Heather Sawyer said in a statement. ""This ruling makes it easier for officials to hide the truth about their motives and conduct from the public.""\n\nThe high court ordered the judge who issued the initial ruling saying the records must be released to review an updated ""privilege log,"" filed by the Senate’s lawyers. But the Supreme Court said the judge cannot review the records to make sure the Senate is not withholding records that should be released.\n\nIn concluding his ruling, Lopez noted that disputes over the 2020 election continue to be ""a central focus of the political realm, a matter outside this Court’s constitutional prerogative.""\n\nHe said the ruling followed longstanding precedent preserving separation of powers and guards lawmaker’s ability to do their jobs without undue interference.

Rand Paul was an opportunity for the GOP to, in a moment echoing one of the McCarthy era’s most notorious hearings ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s foremost experts on infectious diseases, has at long last reached the end of his rope. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was hectoring him in a congressional hearing, when he said, “You are the lead architect responsible from the government, and now 800,000 people have died.”\n\nAs Fauci began his response, stressing masks and vaccines for the umpteenth time, Paul interrupted, “and you have advocated to make it coercive and done by force, and you’ve advocated it be done by mandate.”\n\nRising to high moral dudgeon, Paul resorted to sarcasm: “You have advocated that your infallible opinion be dictated by law.”\n\nFauci had had enough. He put Paul’s attacks into context – and the context is dark.\n\n“I have threats upon my life,” he said. “Harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.” Fauci then got into specifics, and they are chilling: “Just about three or four weeks ago, on December 21, a person was arrested who was on their way from Sacramento to Washington, DC at a speed stop in Iowa. And the police asked him where he was going. And he was going to Washington, DC to kill Dr. Fauci. And they found in his car an AR-15 and multiple magazines of ammunition, because he thinks that maybe I’m killing people.”\n\nNow we know the threat of physical violence is real. The Capitol itself was the scene of a violent and vicious attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot and grievously wounded by a gunman in 2017, and Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head at point blank range in 2011 by a man who murdered a federal judge and five others in the attack.\n\nBut Fauci took it one step further on Wednesday, offering a theory behind Paul’s attacks. He displayed screen shots he said were from one of Paul’s political websites, seeking to raise campaign donations from his attacks on Fauci.\n\nHaving been through more political song and dance than I care to recall, I think I can spot insincerity. Fauci’s response, I believe, was real. It was raw. And it was righteous.\n\nFauci is not infallible, but he is a dedicated public servant who has spent his long career trying to protect Americans from illness and death. He deserves tough questions, to be sure, and even criticism where warranted. But at a time when national security officials warn that, “We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists,” Paul seems to have crossed a line.\n\nThe fact the Rand Paul for Senate committee is raising money on a website called firefauci.org suggests that politics, rather than public health, might be part of the motivation of the junior senator from Kentucky.\n\nThe Senate has always had demagogues, liars and outliers who go too far. Fauci’s measured but heartfelt takedown should have been a Joseph Welch moment. Welch was the lawyer for the US Army when the notorious Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin was spreading hysterical chargers that communists had infiltrated the army, along with the State Department, Treasury and even the White House.\n\nWhen McCarthy impugned a young lawyer from Welch’s firm, the soft-spoken, bespectacled Welch could take it no more. “Until this moment, senator,” he said, “I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” McCarthy was stunned into silence, as Welch continued, “Have you no sense of decency?”\n\nWelch’s response broke the fever. Six months later, McCarthy was formally censured by his Senate colleagues 67-22. Half of the Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn their fellow Republican.\n\nNot now. Paul’s rant against Fauci produced a strong and immediate condemnation from Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “Thank you, first of all, for what you do,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to put your life at risk…. And thank you for calling out this agenda for what it is: an attempt to score political points, to build a political power base around the denial of science and around personal attacks on you and your family.”\n\nBut where was the GOP condemnation of Paul? Nearly nonexistent.\n\nTo his credit, though, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah defended Fauci. “Some of what we do [in these hearings] is performing,” he said, in an apparent reference to Paul’s attack. “And some of what we do is to become informed.”\n\nHe went on to stress his appreciation for Fauci and the other scientists who were testifying. “I do want to point out how much I personally, and I believe the great majority of the people of our country respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do. You are scientists, not politicians. Nevertheless, you are being made subject to the political whims of various political individuals, and that comes at a high cost.”\n\nTwo cheers for Romney for defending Fauci and for labeling the attacks on him as political. But I do wish he had followed through and condemned his GOP colleague the way Republicans condemned McCarthy decades ago. Perhaps that’s too much to ask in these hyper-partisan times.\n\nPerhaps Romney has assessed that condemning Paul might have opposite effect of the censure of McCarthy; that if he were to condemn Paul the result would be a diminution of Romney’s political strength within the Trumpified GOP, while strengthening Paul even more.\n\nThat is a depressing thought, but likely accurate. So long as there is money to be raised, clicks to be earned, votes to be gained, we can expect power-hungry politicians to, well, be reckless and dangerous – even during a deadly pandemic. It seems that political decency is not as contagious as Omicron.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fauci-rand-paul-senate-hearing-claims/', 'Headline': 'Fauci derides Rand Paul in Senate hearing as COVID cases ... - CBS News', 'Snippet': ""Fauci fires back at Rand Paul during heated exchange 02:40.

""So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.""\n\nPaul said earlier in the hearing that an email exchange between Fauci and Dr. Francis Collins, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, showed Fauci and Collins appearing to disagree with scientists who said the coronavirus originated in a lab in China.\n\n""You know, you\'re going back to that original discussion when I brought together a group of people to look at every possibility with an open mind,"" Fauci said. ""So you\'re not only distorting it, you are completely turning it around, as you usually do.""\n\nPaul said in a statement after the hearing, ""Anyone who dares to question Fauci’s smear campaign against other scientists is accused by Fauci of fomenting violence.""\n\n""As someone who actually was the target of semiautomatic gunfire by a Bernie Sanders supporter, I never once accused Senator Sanders of being responsible for the attack and I resent Fauci avoiding the question by ginning up the idea that his opponents are the cause of threats,"" Paul added.\n\nPaul was referring to a 2017 shooting when Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and three other people were wounded after a gunman opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team as they were holding a practice in Alexandria, Va.\n\nIan Sams, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesman, said in a statement after the hearing: ""When it comes to misinformation, Republicans on the committee clearly weren\'t trying to stop the spread.\n\n""At a time when America is seeing rising COVID cases, it’s disappointing and frankly unacceptable that Republican Senators chose to spend a hearing with the country’s leading public health experts spreading conspiracy theories and lies about Dr. Fauci, rather than how we protect people from COVID-19,"" Sams said.\n\nPaul, a steadfast opponent of Covid mitigation measures and mask mandates, has clashed with Fauci before over other pandemic-related issues. Paul was the first senator known to have contracted the coronavirus when he tested positive in March 2020.\n\nIn July, Paul implied that Fauci had previously lied to Congress and was aware of what the lab in Wuhan, China, was doing with grant money that came from the NIH.\n\nTuesday\'s hearing also sparked a tense exchange between Fauci and Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., about Fauci\'s financial disclosures and investments.\n\nAfter the back-and-forth, Fauci was heard on a hot mic saying: ""What a moron.

The only issue, as Fauci pointed out, is that his financial disclosure is public. “You are totally incorrect,” said a flabbergasted Fauci.\n\nMarshall went after Fauci hard on Tuesday, but no lawmaker has attacked him as consistently and ardently as Rand Paul. The anti-vax senator from Kentucky has not only bashed the nation’s top infectious disease expert as an egomaniacal tyrant destroying America, but as someone who is responsible for the disease existing in the first place. Fauci during the hearing shed some light on why Paul might be spreading lies about him.\n\n“Why would a senator want to do this?” Fauci said. “Go to Rand Paul’s website, and you see ‘Fire Dr. Fauci’ with a little box that says contribute here. You can do $5, $10, $20, $100. So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.”\n\nHere’s the full exchange:\n\nFauci exposing one of Paul’s motivations — if not his only motivation — in attacking him came during a heated exchange between the senator and the scientist. Such exchanges are now customary whenever Fauci appears before the Senate. He was particularly exasperated as ever on Tuesday given how Omicron is causing case rates to skyrocket. “We are here at a committee to look a virus now that has killed nearly 900,000 people,” Fauci said. “And the purpose of the committee was to try to get things out, how we can help the American public. And you keep coming back to personal attacks on me.”\n\nFauci eventually dropped the hammer, explaining that the harassment of his family and death threats against himself before recounting how a man who was arrested last month in Iowa was on his way from California to Washington, D.C., to kill Fauci and others. He wondered why a senator would tell lies to inspire such animosity against someone who is basically just sharing the Centers for Disease Control’s guidance on social distancing, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated. The reason is because Paul thinks it’s good for him politically, and there’s no clearer proof than the billing his #FireFauci campaign gets on his website next to all those donation buttons.\n\nPaul has been one of the Republican Party’s most prolific superspreaders of Covid misinformation in addition to attacking Fauci. YouTube has removed several of Paul’s Covid videos for violating their policy on Covid misinformation, prompting Paul to announce earlier this year that he’s leaving the platform. A few days later, he essentially endorsed the Omicron, describing the variant as “nature’s vaccine” during an appearance on Fox News.\n\nAs Paul was badgering Fauci on Tuesday, the United States broke the record for people hospitalized with Covid.

Earlier this month, the NIH’s parent agency the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that ‘the immediate suspension of WIV is necessary to mitigate any potential public health risk’.\n\nWIV has been at the centre of unproven claims that the virus that caused the Covid-19 pandemic escaped from its labs. This latest development exacerbates the drama surrounding the US government’s support of coronavirus research in China prior to the outbreak.\n\nThe WIV research in question, originally awarded funding by the NIH in 2014 and renewed in 2019, was channelled through the New York-based non-profit EcoHealth Alliance. EcoHealth received approximately $600,000 (£467,000) for the project, which involved studying coronaviruses in bats and their potential to jump into humans. The project, which was cancelled in April 2020, was originally funded by the Obama administration. It had come under public attack from Republican politicians in the weeks preceding its termination.\n\nHHS does not argue that the project caused the Covid-19 outbreak, but it does criticise WIV for refusing to share certain information relating to its research.\n\nThe HHS memo, recently released by an oversight committee of the US House of Representatives, noted that the NIH determined in an August 2021 review that the WIV research may have yielded an increase in viral activity that violated the terms of the NIH grant. There was no evidence that EcoHealth had notified the NIH about this possibility as it was required to do, according to HHS.\n\n‘NIH has given WIV several opportunities to disprove this finding, but WIV has failed to do so,’ HHS stated. ‘Due to WIV’s disregard of the NIH’s requests … the NIH’s conclusion that WIV research likely violated protocols of the NIH regarding biosafety is undisputed.’\n\nEcoHealth contends that any increase in viral activity was ‘not statistically significant’, and argues that it had reported the results of its experiments in line with NIH’s requirements.\n\nIn a statement to Chemistry World, EcoHealth says that: ‘The [HHS] claim that there was no evidence that EHA notified NIH about the experiment in question is not correct. EcoHealth Alliance provided the Government Accountability Office with documentation regarding this alleged late reporting that showed the experimental results were first reported in the Year 4 report, which was submitted into the NIH system on time in April 2018, with a copy emailed to the NIAID Program Officer at that time.’\n\nEcoHealth had described the goal of the NIH-funded project as constructing Mers and Mers-like chimeric coronaviruses in order to understand the potential origins of Mers in bats.\n\nWhen NIH abruptly terminated the WIV research in 2020, there was worry that political pressure had motivated the decision. At the time, 77 US Nobel laureates and more than 30 scientific societies including the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology expressed concerns about the decision. The NIH reinstated a diminished version of the grant earlier this year, which no longer includes the involvement of WIV.\n\nThis story was updated on 26 July to include comments from EcoHealth Alliance.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/extremely-disconcerting-nih-didnt-track-us-funds-going-to-chinese-virus-research-watchdog-finds-004808475.html', 'Headline': ""'Extremely disconcerting': NIH didn't track U.S. funds going to ... - Yahoo"", 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, a new government ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, according to a new government report that is sure to raise new questions about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe report is evidence of “major failures in past NIH oversight of high-risk research on enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” Rutgers molecular biologist Richard Ebright told Yahoo News in an email.\n\nIssued by the inspector general of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the new report says nothing about the origins of the coronavirus. For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners. But he has also conceded that much about how the virus came to be remains unknown.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106119', 'Headline': 'Federal Research: NIH Could Take Additional Actions to Manage Risks ...', 'Snippet': 'Specifically, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided $200,000 in grant funding to Wuhan University, the only selected Chinese entity to receive funding directly from a federal agency.

To address this recommendation, NIH noted it may need additional authorities and plans to explore government-wide practices, which will take time. However, federal internal controls require that agencies take timely corrective actions to address risks. While NIH pursues long-term actions for award recipients, it has not conducted its own near-term assessments, which could enhance its internal oversight.\n\nWhy GAO Did This Study\n\nFederal agencies sometimes provide funds to foreign entities, such as universities and laboratories, for research or other purposes. Such collaborations can benefit agency missions and lead to advancements in areas such as public health. At the same time, Congress, the White House, and others have expressed concerns about entities from countries, such as China, exploiting U.S. funded research in ways that could harm U.S. national security or economic competitiveness.\n\nGAO was asked to provide information on federal funds disbursed to three selected Chinese entities—Wuhan University; the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.\n\nThis report examines, among other things, the amount of federal funding GAO identified that was provided to the three selected Chinese entities in calendar years 2014 through 2021 and steps agencies and award recipients have taken to assess risks.\n\nGAO searched USAspending.gov and other federal databases and reviewed award agreements, progress reports, payment information, and other documents from federal agencies and U.S.-based award recipients.

Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions.', 'Full_text': 'Researchers are upset over a new policy released by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to tighten oversight of its ‘subawards’. These are funds that a primary grant recipient can give to a collaborator to perform research on their behalf. The biomedical funder’s policy, set to go into effect on 1 October, specifies that foreign subaward recipients, in particular, will be subject to extra scrutiny.\n\nForeign collaborators will have to provide copies of all relevant laboratory notebooks, data and documentation to the primary recipient every few months. The NIH also reserves the right to request access to this supporting documentation as part of its oversight responsibilities.\n\nNIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research\n\nThe NIH’s dealings with foreign researchers have drawn attention as debate rages over whether the COVID-19 pandemic started with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 passing from animals to humans or from a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China, which is located in the city where early cases were detected.\n\nThe non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, based in New York City, has been especially scrutinized. It had received NIH funds to study coronaviruses, and the WIV received a subaward on this grant to study bat coronaviruses in the wild and their potential to infect people. Part of this work involved creating hybrid bat coronaviruses, which some critics have decried as risky ‘gain of function’ research. (On the basis of EcoHealth’s grant application, the NIH determined that this study didn’t meet the bar for risky research.)\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature worry that the change to the NIH’s subawards policy will have a chilling effect on international collaborations; foreign researchers might forgo partnerships because of the requirements. They also say that scientists will have to spend an unreasonable amount of time on administrative tasks to comply with the policy.\n\nThe policy is “heavy handed” and disrespectful to international collaborators, says Sheela Shenoi, an infectious-disease physician at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “It suggests that international collaborators need additional oversight — that they don’t have capacity to do their own research in a rigorous and robust way.”\n\nAmanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, responds that this provision “empowers primary recipients to obtain, on a regular basis, records and data from foreign subrecipients without having to worry that they will not be able to access materials when needed”. She adds: “As part of high-quality science, there should be a free flow of information, documents and data.”\n\nUnder fire\n\nThe NIH has come under fire from federal auditors for, among other things, its handling of the EcoHealth grant. When it first funded EcoHealth, the NIH instructed the organization to report any evidence of unexpected transmissibility or virulence of the hybrid viruses. A progress report from EcoHealth was two years late owing to a miscommunication and a technical glitch, the organization has said. Federal auditors have criticized the NIH for not pursuing the late report and recommended that the agency intensify its monitoring of foreign subaward recipients.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nThe NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant in 2020, but then said it would reinstate it if EcoHealth could meet certain conditions, including obtaining the WIV’s lab notebooks. In part because EcoHealth was unable to do so, last August the NIH terminated the subaward altogether.\n\nPeter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, responds that oversight of federally funded research is important, but that the subaward policy might have unintended consequences that are counter to its mission. “This might lead to countries cutting collaborative ties with US scientists, rather than handing over their laboratory notebooks,” he says. “This would weaken America’s pandemic preparedness at the very time when we need to be developing partnerships in regions where the next pandemic is most likely to originate.”\n\nConcerns voiced\n\nResearchers have condemned the policy’s focus on foreign subrecipients. Stefano Bertuzzi, chief executive of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington DC, says he supports extra accountability and oversight for subawards, but he is “puzzled by why only foreign entities are singled out”.\n\nA virologist from Brazil, who requested anonymity out of fear that their chances of receiving funding could be harmed, says the policy adds a layer of bureaucracy, crafted with politics — not science — in mind.\n\n‘Heinous!’: Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions\n\nIn addition to concerns about international partnerships, Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, says that the policy imposes an administrative burden without providing more funding to meet the requirements. Keusch organized researchers to protest EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020.\n\nFor some researchers, this isn’t a trivial matter. Oleksandr Zeziulin, a specialist in drug abuse and mental health at the Ukrainian Institute on Public Health Policy in Kyiv, says that, because of Russia’s invasion last year, Ukraine has been struggling with constant power outages. “During the winter, we were struggling with our normal schedule, and we’re expecting the same next winter, given Russia’s attacks on power plants,” says Zeziulin, who is a subrecipient of a grant with Shenoi. “If this policy will require an extra 10% of our time, I think it’s going to be [difficult], given the situation we’re in.”\n\nNot all researchers think the policy is unreasonable, however. David Relman, a microbiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, says it addresses concerns that “US expectations and standards for research reproducibility and transparency may not be shared elsewhere in the world”. But he has concerns that it might discourage international collaborations and worries that it’s unclear which elements of lab notebooks would need to be shared. He calls on the NIH to clarify this provision and to clearly communicate to the research community the motivations and goals of the policy.\n\nThe ambiguity could mean that the policy will face legal challenges in some countries, says the Brazilian virologist. Many researchers work on several overlapping research projects from various funders, and some countries carefully safeguard data — for instance, biodiversity data in Brazil — that will be difficult to keep separate.\n\nThe agency is accepting comments on the policy until 26 June, but it’s unclear whether it will make revisions based on feedback. Fine says: “These changes have been made, they are not proposed.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01566-0', 'Headline': 'NIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Research organization EcoHealth Alliance plans to investigate coronaviruses in bats.

In April 2020, after then-US-president Donald Trump hinted that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a WIV laboratory, the NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant. Its goal was to study how coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, jump from bats to humans. A few months later, the NIH reinstated and immediately suspended the award until certain conditions were met that, at the time, EcoHealth said were impossible to complete.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature applaud the renewal, adding that this type of research is essential to avert the next pandemic. They claim that the NIH’s termination and subsequent suspension were politically motivated, and that, although long overdue, this renewal ends — for now — a drama-filled exchange between the agency and EcoHealth.\n\n“It’s about goddam time,” says Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, who organized researchers to push back against EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020. “The integrity of science requires a barrier against political interference,” he says.\n\nThe NIH “routinely considers processes and measures for strengthening [its] oversight over federal funds” and has been working with EcoHealth to strengthen its “administrative processes to meet NIH’s expectations”, says Amanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Washington DC.\n\nLengthy list of conditions\n\nAlthough the organization will now be able to continue its bat coronavirus research for the first time since the saga began, the NIH placed an extensive list of restrictions on the four-year, US$2.9-million award. None of the researchers who spoke to Nature had ever seen a grant with so many stipulations.\n\nAmong other things, EcoHealth is specifically forbidden from performing any in-country research in China, including with the WIV, or collecting any new samples from vertebrates — such as bats. The revised grant also mandates greater scrutiny of EcoHealth’s finances and accounting practices, driven in part by a federal watchdog report, released in January, finding that EcoHealth had misreported about $90,000 in expenses. The report also faulted the NIH for improperly terminating EcoHealth’s grant.\n\nFurthermore, EcoHealth will be forbidden from performing any work that is deemed by the NIH’s parent organization, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to have the potential to enhance the virulence or transmission of a virus. This restriction stems, in part, from criticism that research done at the WIV and funded by an EcoHealth subaward qualified as ‘gain of function’ research.\n\nDisputed research\n\nCongressional Republicans have alleged that this research, which involved attaching spike proteins from wild bat coronaviruses to an unrelated virus to determine whether the wild pathogens could infect human airway cells, should have undergone HHS review. Anthony Fauci, then-director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the agency concluded that these experiments did not meet the bar to undergo such review, and noted that the WIV did not intend to enhance the viruses.\n\nTens of thousands of people exposed to bat coronaviruses each year\n\nVirologists say this type of research is essential for developing vaccines and therapeutics against emerging pathogens and for understanding how likely a pathogen is to spark a pandemic. The NIH and HHS have been finalizing guidance that will probably tighten the oversight of such research in the United States.\n\n“I don’t know if any other single grantee from NIH has been subjected to this level of oversight,” says Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance. Yet he is “positive and optimistic” about the grant restart, despite all the restrictions. A key priority for the newly released funds will be analysing nearly 300 partial or complete genomes of SARS-related coronaviruses from samples that the organization collected before the funding halt, he says.\n\nThird rail of virology\n\nThese restrictions seem reasonable, in light of the enormous public attention to and scrutiny of gain-of-function research, says Lawrence Gostin, a health-law and policy specialist at Georgetown University in Washington DC. Still, Gostin says he is surprised the agency restarted its funding for EcoHealth, given that it has been the “third rail of politics” the past few years.\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, says she is pleasantly surprised to see the grant renewed, but worries about the “terrible precedent” that the NIH set by “arbitrarily” terminating an award on the basis of “unfounded rumours” regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2. She hopes that these same restrictions will not apply to other scientists doing similar work, but is encouraged by the number of research groups that are now studying coronaviruses following the COVID-19 pandemic.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://thebulletin.org/2022/08/nih-to-terminate-ecohealth-alliance-grant-after-its-wuhan-partners-refuse-to-deliver-information-on-coronavirus-studies/', 'Headline': 'NIH to terminate part of EcoHealth Alliance grant after its Wuhan ...', 'Snippet': 'A letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institute of Health (NIH) is partially terminating a grant to a nonprofit that worked extensively with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on bat coronavirus research. In letters posted by Republicans on the House Oversight Committee this month, an NIH official said EcoHealth Alliance had not been able to hand over lab notebooks and other records from its Wuhan partner that relate to controversial experiments involving modified bat viruses, despite multiple requests.\n\nIn an Aug. 19 letter to Kentucky Rep James Comer, the top Republican member of the US House Oversight Committee, Michael Lauer, the deputy director of extramural research at NIH, said the agency had informed EcoHealth that it was terminating the sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology “for failure to meet award terms and conditions requiring provision of records to NIH upon request.”\n\nThe termination notice comes after the NIH chided EcoHealth last fall for not immediately notifying the agency after its experiments showed modified coronaviruses replicated at a faster rate in experimental mice than an unmodified virus. The agency then asked for lab notebooks and other files pertaining to the experiments, and EcoHealth reported that it would relay the request to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the new NIH letters, the Wuhan institute never delivered.\n\n“NIH has requested on two occasions that [EcoHealth] provide NIH the laboratory notebooks and original electronic files from the research conducted at [the Wuhan Institute of Virology]. To date, [the institute] has not provided these records,” Lauer told Comer. NIH verified to the Bulletin that the letters were authentic.\n\nA letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide the requested records, and [EcoHealth’s] failure to include the required terms in [the] subaward agreement represent material failures to comply with the terms of award,” the letter said.\n\nBetween June 2017 and May 2019, scientists working on EcoHealth’s grant tested genetically engineered coronaviruses with the backbone of one virus and the spike proteins—which bind to host cells—of another on mice that expressed human cell receptors. In one case, the NIH reported last fall, one of the chimeric viruses caused mice to become “sicker.” EcoHealth reports show that in the infection experiments, conducted in years four and five of the grant, chimeric viruses replicated faster in mice lungs and killed a higher percentage of mice than the unmodified virus. Last fall, the NIH said that EcoHealth was supposed to report the increased viral growth to the agency “immediately” to assess whether further biosafety measures were necessary.\n\nThe NIH said the Wuhan institute’s experiments under the EcoHealth grant involved viruses that were too genetically distant to have evolved to become SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But some critics of so-called gain-of-function experimentation—in which pathogens are enhanced in way that makes them, say, more transmissible—have said last fall’s revelations point to risky research projects being undertaken at the laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the first reported cases of COVID were reported. Research published recently in Science points to the pandemic having sprung from a seafood market in the city where animals that could have harbored coronavirus infections were kept. That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth has not responded to a request for comment about NIH’s decision to partially terminate its grant.\n\nAccording to the new NIH letters, EcoHealth can work with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to revise the grants without involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If that is not possible, the NIH will ask that the grant be “bilaterally terminated.” Should a reworked grant be possible, the agency will add new terms to it, including increased NIH oversight over EcoHealth for at least three years and increased reporting requirements for the nonprofit. The nonprofit will also be required to visit its sub-awardees every six months to ensure compliance with the grant.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/451221/nih-gives-more-bat-coronavirus-funding-to-wuhan-lab-linked-ecohealth/', 'Headline': 'NIH gives more bat coronavirus funding to Wuhan lab-linked EcoHealth', 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health is providing more viral research funding, including related to bat coronaviruses, to U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance, linked to an infamous Wuhan lab.

Both likely began as zoonotic spillover events, leading to small case clusters, but were not identified until significant community spread made control difficult, and in the case of COVID-19, led to a pandemic,” EcoHealth said in its newly successful grant abstract last month, contending that COVID-19 likely emerged in nature rather than through a lab leak.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released an assessment in 2021 stating that one U.S. intelligence agency assessed with “moderate confidence” that COVID-19 most likely emerged from the Chinese government lab in Wuhan, while four U.S. spy agencies and the National Intelligence Council believe with “low confidence” COVID-19 most likely has a natural origin. Fauci has said a natural origin is most likely.\n\n“Our results will provide detailed information on the risk of future CoV spillover and spread and will inform potential public health interventions to reduce spillover risk and outbreak potential,” EcoHealth also said in its successful grant proposal. “They may also provide data on wildlife reservoirs and community spillover events of relevance to the origin of COVID-19.”\n\nEcoHealth leader Peter Daszak was a longtime collaborator with the Wuhan lab who steered hundreds of thousands of dollars in NIH funding to the Chinese lab and was also an integral World Health Organization-China joint study team member in early 2021.\n\nDaszak also dismissed the lab leak hypothesis in March 2021 when he admitted he took Wuhan lab workers at their word. Meeting minutes from discussions between lab scientists in Wuhan and the WHO-China team reveal lab leak concerns were referred to as “myths” and “conspiracy theories.”\n\nDespite the Wuhan lab’s opacity, the NIH still said in August that NIAID “will begin to engage with [EcoHealth] to renegotiate the specific aims and objectives of the R01 grant without the involvement of [Wuhan Institute of Virgology] … in light of the cooperation from [EcoHealth] and the substantial subsequent improvements in administrative processes that [EcoHealth] demonstrated.” Bat coronavirus funding for EcoHealth is now back.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nRepublicans say the findings showed EcoHealth was funding risky gain-of-function research in China.\n\nThe NIH had been run until recently by Dr. Francis Collins, while Fauci still leads NIAID.'}}",98.125,2

""If a person wanted to be vaccinated, that person would have to go to the south. So drive around 15 to 20 hours crossing front lines in the mountains."" Even then, after such a treacherous journey through a war zone, it\'s not clear if doses would be available. Like many low-income countries, Yemen has struggled to get hold of vaccine.\n\nLoading...\n\n""Yemen has been one of the places with the lowest vaccination rates in the world,"" says Lavoie. ""And that\'s despite the fact that we\'ve experienced three waves of COVID."" Currently fewer than 2% of Yemenis are fully vaccinated.\n\nYemen is one of 36 countries that fall below the 10% immunization threshold, some with rates under 2%. Much of the mid-section of Africa is in that category, including powerful economic and political players like Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nBy contrast, many wealthy countries have fully vaccinated more than 80% of their citizens.\n\nWhy Africa lags so far behind\n\nMaaza Seyoum with the African Alliance, a South Africa-based advocacy group, says there are many factors playing in to the low vaccination rates in many countries on the continent but the biggest issue is simply that African nations have struggled to get doses.\n\n""Initially, 100 percent, I would say the problem was a lack of access (to vaccines) and a global system that did not prioritize African countries,"" Maaza says. Wealthy nations bought up far more pharmaceutical firms vaccine production than they could even use. The WHO-backed COVAX program faltered as it relied heavily on voluntary donations and on manufacturers in India who were blocked from exporting doses when COVID case numbers skyrocketed on the sub-continent. Some African countries managed to get supplies from China but Beijing often prioritized donations to wealthier trading partners.\n\nThat situation has changed, says Maaza. Recently vaccine deliveries to Africa have increased. But now there are new problems: the shipments are haphazard and sometimes consist of less popular brands that are about to expire.\n\n""Now we\'re seeing the sort of drip, drip, drip of vaccines,"" she says. ""People are waiting for vaccines to come. They come, then they stop.""\n\nThis unpredictable supply chain, she says, makes it nearly impossible for African countries to plan nationwide vaccination drives. And in some of these places where hardly anyone has gotten the jab, rumors about the mysterious vaccine have flourished and augmented vaccine hesitancy.\n\n""The truth is, there is vaccine hesitancy everywhere,"" Maaza says. ""But as people are waiting, it leaves kind of a fertile ground for these rumors to circulate.""\n\nWhich makes convincing people to come to a clinic and get immunized even more of a challenge.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhat\'s behind those under 10% vaccination numbers\n\nThe World Health Organization set a goal of trying to push all countries to 40% vaccine coverage by the end of 2021. The 36 countries still under 10% obviously didn\'t even get close. Kate O\'Brien, the director of immunization and vaccines for the World Health Organization, says this is a significant problem.\n\n""For countries that are struggling to get even above 10%, what this means is that health-care workers are not fully vaccinated yet,"" she says. ""It means older age populations, those who have underlying medical conditions, the people at highest risk are not fully protected yet.""\n\nShe acknowledges vaccine supply inequity as a major part of why rates are so low in these three dozen countries but says there are other reasons too. Many of these countries had health systems that were struggling even before the pandemic to meet local medical needs. Some of them have needed to upgrade refrigeration systems to be able to store certain mRNA vaccines at extremely low temperatures. Others need syringes. All of this takes money that many low-income nations health ministries may not have.\n\n""A COVID vaccine campaign does require funding,"" O\'Brien says. Countries need money ""to deploy new health workers and to assure that the clinics have the resources that they need.""\n\nAnd while there has been some international assistance to lower-income nations to help, that financing has also at times been haphazard and unpredictable.\n\nOngoing conflicts present another obstacle\n\nAway from Africa, the other nations that haven\'t yet gotten above 10% COVID vaccine coverage are some of the most troubled in the world, including Yemen as well as Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti.\n\nCurrently the armed conflict has displaced 4 million of 30 million Yemenis from their homes. Various groups control different parts of the country. According to the U.N. more than 2/3rds of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance. Yet international aid agencies have struggled to meet those needs and keep their operations running in the country due to the ongoing insecurity and a lack of funding.\n\nFor most people in Yemen, life is incredibly difficult. COVID vaccinations are ""not on the top of the list of priorities for many people in Yemen,"" Jasmin Lavoie with NRC says. He says most Yemenis spend their days trying to find food, shelter, decent toilets and worrying about whether they\'ll have to flee fighting once again. ""These are reasons why people are not getting vaccinated too,"" he adds.\n\nThere are similar issues in other conflict zones. ""In a place like Afghanistan, in a place like Syria, COVID is not their number one priority,"" says Paul Spiegel, who runs the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSpiegel returned to Baltimore from working in Afghanistan in mid-December. ""[Vaccination] campaigns are happening,"" he says but adds that the immunization drives are constrained by the limited shipments of vaccine. ""A fair bit of it is Johnson and Johnson, which makes a lot of sense in Afghanistan situation because it\'s just one dose,"" he notes.\n\nBut similar to Yemen, the social upheaval in Afghanistan, with the U.S. departing and the Taliban returning to power, has pushed COVID to the backburner. Vaccine drives are not a top priority for the Taliban, even though it has said it supports vaccination drives by COVAX and the U.N.\n\nNor is it a priority among Afghans. ""Right now there\'s such a dire humanitarian situation there,"" he says. ""[Afghans] are worried about getting food on the table, they\'re worried about feeding their kids. And so COVID is not a priority for the average person.""'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/covid-19-vaccination-rates-by-country', 'Headline': 'COVID-19 Vaccination Rates by Country - U.S. News & World Report', 'Snippet': 'The emergency authorizations of several COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020 and early 2021 led the world to its next phase of the pandemic: getting these novel shots into arms worldwide.

A vaccinated person refers to someone who has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and a fully vaccinated person has received either a single-dose vaccine or both doses of a two-dose vaccine, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots.\n\nMany countries started to administer additional doses toward the end of 2021 after research found that vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. More than 2.72 billion additional doses have been administered worldwide. Additional doses include booster doses given to fully vaccinated individuals when the protection from the original shots has begun to decline, as well as extra shots given to people, such as the immunocompromised, who did not have a strong immune response from their initial doses.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the manufacturers of two of the most widely used Covid-19 vaccinations, have developed updated vaccines that more effectively protect against the newer Omicron variant. These are currently being administered in many countries, including the United States and Britain.\n\nVaccination rates around the world have stagnated in recent months, with public demand dropping even as vaccine supply has become more abundant.\n\nEarly leads in vaccination rates have become entrenched. Africa has the lowest vaccination rate of any continent, with just 37.2 percent of the population receiving at least one dose of a vaccine, compared to 82.3 percent in Latin America.\n\nMore than two-dozen different vaccines have been used worldwide, according to data from Our World in Data.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://theconversation.com/covid-why-the-current-surge-in-cases-is-a-problem-for-some-countries-but-not-others-179716', 'Headline': 'COVID: why the current surge in cases is a problem for some countries ...', 'Snippet': 'In comparison, countries that followed a zero COVID strategy are now seeing a larger surge in infections and deaths as they open up, even if they have high vaccine coverage.', 'Full_text': 'Just when it looked like COVID cases were starting to fall after the high peaks of January, infections are rising once again around the world. The main driver of this latest surge is the more infectious BA.2 sub-lineage of the omicron variant, which has been becoming more common ever since Christmas.\n\nIn the UK, increased social mixing and waning vaccine effectiveness – even in those who have had a booster dose – are contributing to this rise. But we’re also seeing huge spikes in areas that had previously kept themselves fairly COVID-free – New Zealand, Hong Kong and South Korea, for example.\n\nCase rates in these places are currently outstripping those seen in many European countries when they were at their worst, despite these newly struggling countries tending to follow rigorous zero COVID policies, with tight border controls and strict internal measures to limit infections. The highly infectious new variant having a bigger effect in places where restrictions are tighter. But why?\n\nZero cases equals delayed cases\n\nLong before COVID, it was known that non-pharmaceutical control measures – whether within a country or at its border – rarely stop a pandemic spreading. Usually, these things – lockdowns, quarantines and so on – only delay a disease’s spread. However, this may be sufficient to flatten the curve of infections and ease pressure on health services, or to reduce illness and death by delaying most infections until treatments have improved or vaccines become available.\n\nIn reality, the most influential disease-control factor is immunity, which can be generated by infection or vaccination. Both are important. As I pointed out last summer, the end of the pandemic in any country will likely depend on the proportion of people who have already had a COVID infection, and not just the proportion vaccinated.\n\nBreakthrough infections in those who are vaccinated will drive their immunity to a higher level, while in the unvaccinated an infection provides a level of protection that would otherwise have been absent. In fact, immunity following an infection now gives rather better protection against being infected in the future than immunity from a booster vaccine, especially once 90 days have passed since being vaccinated.\n\nThis helps to explain why some countries are now handling outbreaks better than others. In the UK, despite excellent vaccination coverage, the majority of people have also now caught COVID, and many people have caught COVID more than once. Cases are high for sure, but not as high as in some of these Pacific countries, and rates of death and severe disease are remaining at a relatively low level.\n\nIn comparison, countries that followed a zero COVID strategy are now seeing a larger surge in infections and deaths as they open up, even if they have high vaccine coverage. Their lack of prior infections means immunity across the population is lower.\n\nVaccines still making a difference\n\nBut despite the fact that both Hong Kong and New Zealand have both suffered huge rises in viral transmission recently, the impact on public health in the two places has been dramatically different.\n\nNew Zealand, with high vaccine coverage and a recent booster programme, is weathering this surge with far fewer deaths so far. Hong Kong has seen many more deaths, with a death rate per million people in the four weeks up to March 18 2022 that’s 38 times as great as in New Zealand.\n\nThe difference is down to the vaccination campaigns in these two places. In Hong Kong, at least up to the end of February, the uptake of the booster vaccine was much lower than in New Zealand, and was particularly low in older, more vulnerable age groups. Even second-dose coverage was low in these groups, meaning plenty were at a high risk of severe disease and death.\n\nDid the UK get it right?\n\nMy own country, the UK, decided to lift its remaining restrictions earlier this year, even though cases were still high when controls were eased and remain high now. Was this the right thing to do?\n\nThere’s no right answer, but given that non-pharmaceutical control measures only delay infections rather than prevent them, such measures should only continue if the benefits of delaying infections outweigh the more general harms to society and human health that come with restricting people’s freedoms. Given the high levels of immunity across the British population that have resulted from high case levels and good vaccine coverage, lifting controls made sense.\n\nThere’s also another important point to consider here. It’s been well publicised that the vaccines’ protective effect against catching the virus and developing symptoms wanes more quickly than protection against severe disease and death. However, there’s emerging evidence (still in preprint, so awaiting review by other scientists) that protection against severe disease also wanes with time.\n\nWhat this means is that delaying infections could result in people getting COVID at a later date when they are more susceptible to getting badly ill. This was predicted in some of the disease modelling of omicron published at the end of last year (also still in preprint). Imposing additional restrictions in December 2021 would have reduced COVID deaths in January 2022, but at the cost of increased deaths in March.\n\nPersonally, I would have preferred to wait till the end of March to lift restrictions, so that we were into spring, when respiratory viruses spread less rapidly. That could have reduced the current NHS pressures stemming from staff absences.\n\nAnd finally, even though lifting controls made sense, today the UK still has a population of older or clinically vulnerable people who have not yet had the virus and whose vaccine immunity is waning. We must focus now on preventing these people from developing severe disease – perhaps through further vaccine boosters or use of antiviral drugs – rather than on attempting to reduce transmission in the general population.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/30/world/covid-cases-omicron.html', 'Headline': 'See Where Virus Cases Are Rising Fastest - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'Similarly, some of the European countries currently facing serious surges have among the world’s highest vaccination rates.

In France, the daily case average passed 100,000.\n\nCases in Canada have also seen a steep increase in recent days, more than doubling in a week to an average of more than 25,000. And Australia’s cases climbed to an average of more than 12,600 on Wednesday — eight times as high as just three weeks earlier.\n\nAs dramatic as these case counts are, they are also likely an undercount because of asymptomatic cases, reporting lags due to the holiday season, lack of test availability in many places and at-home tests whose results may not be reported.\n\nIn the United States, where Omicron is spreading quickly, 16 states and Puerto Rico are at their all-time case records. These include states with comparatively high vaccination rates: Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island, all of which are at least 70 percent fully vaccinated. In addition to being more transmissible generally, Omicron also appears to give rise to more breakthrough infections.\n\nSimilarly, some of the European countries currently facing serious surges have among the world’s highest vaccination rates. In Portugal, where 88 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, cases are up more than 200 percent in the past two weeks. Spain, where new cases have more than quintupled in the past three weeks, is 80 percent fully vaccinated.\n\nSo far, overall hospitalization and death rates have not come close to reaching previous peak levels, though some places are struggling. About 78,000 people in the United States are hospitalized with the virus, compared with over 130,000 at the height of last winter’s peak. The average daily rate of deaths across much of the world also remains lower than the record rates seen earlier in the pandemic.\n\nA combination of immunity from vaccines, booster shots and previous infections is most likely at least partially responsible for lower hospitalization and mortality. Encouraging early data also suggests the Omicron variant may be less virulent than previous strains of the virus.\n\nThe recent surges in all these places, however, have been fast and steep, and severe outcomes usually lag case spikes by at least a few weeks, so hospitalizations and death rates may rise in the coming days.\n\n“This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse and again disrupting lives and livelihoods,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said at a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nCase rates in South America, Asia and much of Africa have so far remained relatively low. And at least some countries that saw record case loads this month may be turning a corner. In southern Africa, where scientists first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization, cases remain higher than on the rest of the continent but appear to be abating.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. health officials continued to stress the importance of vaccination and booster doses. In a White House news briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that people eligible for a booster shot who have not yet gotten one “do have some protection against severe disease and death,” though she added that “they do have quite a bit of waning with regard to protection against infection.”\n\nThat group with waning immunity comprises those who completed a Moderna or Pfizer two-dose series six months ago or more, or received a Johnson & Johnson shot at least two months ago.\n\nAlthough Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, discouraged large New Year’s Eve parties, his advice in the news conference Wednesday was more measured when it came to small gatherings of vaccinated people.\n\n“Although the risk is never zero in anything, the risk is low enough that we feel you should continue to go through with those plans of having a home-related, vaccinated, boosted gathering with family and close friends who are also vaccinated and boosted,” he said.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)01468-X/fulltext', 'Headline': 'The big catch-up in immunisation coverage after the COVID ... - The Lancet', 'Snippet': 'The COVID-19 pandemic knocked countries off the trajectory towards vaccine and immunisation success by 2030, but the ongoing recovery shows that countries are taking action, partners are geared up, and that the goals and the vision of IA2030 are achievable. ...

This page provides an up-to-date visual narrative of the spread of Covid-19, so please check back regularly because we are refreshing it with new graphics and features as the story evolves.\n\nEurope’s average count of coronavirus-related deaths overtook Asia’s in early March 2020. From mid-April, focus shifted to the US, where the number of deaths has remained consistently high, although the focus of the epidemic has shifted from the northeast to other regions of the country. Latin America became the epicentre of the pandemic in the summer of 2020, with the region accounting for almost a half of deaths each day. However, the surge in Europe since the autumn means Covid-19 remains a global pandemic.\n\nWith several vaccines approved for use, the race is now on for countries to vaccinate their populations:\n\nThere are concerns, however, that reported Covid-19 deaths are not capturing the true impact of coronavirus on mortality around the world. The FT has gathered and analysed data on excess mortality — the numbers of deaths over and above the historical average — across the globe, and has found that numbers of deaths in some countries are more than 50 per cent higher than usual. In many countries, these excess deaths exceed reported numbers of Covid-19 deaths by large margins.\n\nThere are several different ways of comparing excess deaths figures between countries. In absolute numbers, more people than would usually be expected have died in the in the US than in any of the other countries for which recent all-cause mortality data is available.\n\nAdjusting for typical mortality rates, the five hardest hit countries worldwide where data is available are all in Latin America. Peru has seen more than double the number of deaths it sees in a typical year, and neighbouring Ecuador has seen a 67 per cent increase. Nicaragua (a 59 per cent rise), Bolivia (56) and Mexico (55) complete the top five.\n\nReporting, data analysis and graphics by Steven Bernard, David Blood, John Burn-Murdoch, Oliver Elliott, Max Harlow, Joanna S Kao, William Rohde Madsen, Caroline Nevitt, Alan Smith, Martin Stabe, Cale Tilford and Aleksandra Wisniewska.

In Romania, that figure is at 40.5%, according to ECDC data.\n\n“For countries not yet hit by the Omicron surge, there is a closing window of opportunity to act now and plan for contingencies,” Kluge warned.\n\nKluge used the example of Denmark, where he said Omicron cases had “exploded” in recent weeks. The Covid-19 hospitalization rate for unvaccinated Danes was six times higher than for those who were fully vaccinated in the week over Christmas.\n\nKluge’s calls come as other health authorities consider strengthening their mask guidelines to help tackle Omicron. On Monday, the Washington Post reported that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was considering recommending N95 or KN95 masks for those who can use them.\n\nNew terms\n\nAs school terms begin amid record surges in many European countries, Kluge stressed that they should be “the last places to close and the first to reopen.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the variant will continue to infect large numbers of people and “schools may be unable to keep all classes open all the time, due to a lack of staff.”\n\nBut he stressed that “keeping schools open has important benefits for children’s mental, social and educational well-being,” recommending that arrangements should be made for “online learning alongside physical presence, so children can continue with their education when they are unable to attend school in person.”\n\nHe reiterated WHO’s recommendations for educational settings: ventilation, hand hygiene and the use of appropriate face masks.\n\nKluge added that “countries may wish to consider reviewing the protocols on testing, isolation and quarantine of classroom contacts to minimize disruption to learning, mitigating these risks as far as possible with good ventilation and mask usage.”'}}",96.5,2
