Noted conspiracy theorist Milton William Cooper first ushered this rallying cry into the mainstream in the 1990s through his radio show, where he discussed schemes involving things such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, an Illuminati cabal and alien life. Cooper died in 2001, but his legacy lives on. Radio host Alex Jones’s fans, anti-vaccine activists and disciples of QAnon’s convoluted alternate reality often implore skeptics to do their own research.\n\nYet more mainstream groups have also offered this advice. Digital literacy advocates and those seeking to combat online misinformation sometimes spread the idea that when you are faced with a piece of news that seems odd or out of sync with reality, the best course of action is to investigate it yourself. For instance, in 2021 the Office of the U.S. Surgeon General put out a guide recommending that those wondering about a health claim’s legitimacy should “type the claim into a search engine to see if it has been verified by a credible source.” Library and research guides, often suggestthat people “Google it!” or use other search engines to vet information.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nUnfortunately, this time science seems to be on the conspiracy theorists’ side. Encouraging Internet users to rely on search engines to verify questionable online articles can make them more prone to believing false or misleading information, according to a study published today in Nature. The new research quantitatively demonstrates how search results, especially those prompted by queries that contain keywords from misleading articles, can easily lead people down digital rabbit holes and backfire. Guidance to Google a topic is insufficient if people aren’t considering what they search for and the factors that determine the results, the study suggests.\n\nIn five different experiments conducted between late 2019 and 2022, the researchers asked a total of thousands of online participants to categorize timely news articles as true, false or unclear. A subset of the participants received prompting to use a search engine before categorizing the articles, whereas a control group didn’t. At the same time, six professional fact-checkers evaluated the articles to provide definitive designations. Across the different tests, the nonprofessional respondents were about 20 percent more likely to rate false or misleading information as true after they were encouraged to search online. This pattern held even for very salient, heavily reported news topics such as the COVID pandemic and even after months had elapsed between an article’s initial publication and the time of the participants’ search (when presumably more fact-checks would be available online).\n\nFor one experiment, the study authors also tracked participants’ search terms and the links provided on the first page of the results of a Google query. They found that more than a third of respondents were exposed to misinformation when they searched for more detail on misleading or false articles. And often respondents’ search terms contributed to those troubling results: Participants used the headline or URL of a misleading article in about one in 10 verification attempts. In those cases, misinformation beyond the original article showed up in results more than half the time.\n\nFor example, one of the misleading articles used in the study was entitled “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter.” When participants included “engineered famine”—a unique term specifically used by low-quality news sources—in their fact-check searches, 63 percent of these queries prompted unreliable results. In comparison, none of the search queries that excluded the word “engineered” returned misinformation.\n\n“I was surprised by how many people were using this kind of naive search strategy,” says the study’s lead author Kevin Aslett, an assistant professor of computational social science at the University of Central Florida. “It’s really concerning to me.”\n\nSearch engines are often people’s first and most frequent pit stops on the Internet, says study co-author Zeve Sanderson, executive director of New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics. And it’s anecdotally well-established they play a role in manipulating public opinion and disseminating shoddy information, as exemplified by social scientist Safiya Noble’s research into how search algorithms have historically reinforced racist ideas. But while a bevy of scientific research has assessed the spread of misinformation across social media platforms, fewer quantitative assessments have focused on search engines.\n\nThe new study is novel for measuring just how much a search can shift users’ beliefs, says Melissa Zimdars, an assistant professor of communication and media at Merrimack College. “I’m really glad to see someone quantitatively show what my recent qualitative research has suggested,” says Zimdars, who co-edited the book Fake News: Understanding Media and Misinformation in the Digital Age. She adds that she’s conducted research interviews with many people who have noted that they frequently use search engines to vet information they see online and that doing so has made fringe ideas seem “more legitimate.”\n\n“This study provides a lot of empirical evidence for what many of us have been theorizing,” says Francesca Tripodi, a sociologist and media scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. People often assume top results have been vetted, she says. And while tech companies such as Google have instituted efforts to rein in misinformation, things often still fall through the cracks. Problems especially arise in “data voids” when information is sparse for particular topics. Often those seeking to spread a particular message will purposefully take advantage of these data voids, coining terms likely to circumvent mainstream media sources and then repeating them across platforms until they become conspiracy buzzwords that lead to more misinformation, Tripodi says.\n\nGoogle actively tries to combat this problem, a company spokesperson tells Scientific American. “At Google, we design our ranking systems to emphasize quality and not to expose people to harmful or misleading information that they are not looking for,” the Google representative says. “We also provide people tools that help them evaluate the credibility of sources.” For example, the company adds warnings on some search results when a breaking news topic is rapidly evolving and might not yet yield reliable results. The spokesperson further notes that several assessments have determined Google outcompetes other search engines when it comes to filtering out misinformation. Yet data voids pose an ongoing challenge to all search providers, they add.\n\nThat said, the new research has its own limitations. For one, the experimental setup means the study doesn’t capture people’s natural behavior when it comes to evaluating news says Danaë Metaxa, an assistant professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. The study, they point out, didn’t give all participants the option of deciding whether to search, and people might have behaved differently if they were given a choice. Further, even the professional fact-checkers that contributed to the study were confused by some of the articles, says Joel Breakstone, director of Stanford University’s History Education Group, where he researches and develops digital literacy curriculums focused on combatting online misinformation. The fact-checkers didn’t always agree on how to categorize articles. And among stories for which more fact-checkers disagreed, searches also showed a stronger tendency to boost participants’ belief in misinformation. It’s possible that some of the study findings are simply the result of confusing information—not search results.\n\nYet the work still highlights a need for better digital literacy interventions, Breakstone says. Instead of just telling people to search, guidance on navigating online information should be much clearer about how to search and what to search for. Breakstone’s research has found that techniques such as lateral reading, where a person is encouraged to seek out information about a source, can reduce belief in misinformation. Avoiding the trap of terminology and diversifying search terms is an important strategy, too, Tripodi adds.\n\n“Ultimately, we need a multipronged solution to misinformation—one that is much more contextual and spans politics, culture, people and technology,” Zimdars says. People are often drawn to misinformation because of their own lived experiences that foster suspicion in systems, such as negative interactions with health care providers, she adds. Beyond strategies for individual data literacy, tech companies and their online platforms, as well as government leaders, need to take steps to address the root causes of public mistrust and to lessen the flow of faux news. There is no single fix or perfect Google strategy poised to shut down misinformation. Instead the search continues.""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/why-did-jurisdictions-repeatedly-use-inefficient-lockdowns-during-the-covid-19-pandemic', 'Headline': 'Why Did Jurisdictions Repeatedly Use Inefficient Lockdowns During the ...', 'Snippet': 'Despite the surge of COVID-19 information, including the knowledge that generally speaking only a particular small subset of the population was especially vulnerable, government officials and politicians made no significant change to the lockdown policy. The same ineffective but extremely costly policies were repeated over and over.', 'Full_text': 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, economy-wide lockdowns, though never part of any pandemic strategy endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), were immediately applied, almost universally around the world, and repeated throughout the first five waves of the disease. During this time politicians, policy analysts, scientists, and public health officials learned a considerable amount about the nature of the virus and the efficacy of lockdown policies. They understood very early on that the virus would not be as lethal as predicted, and by the fall of 2020 they knew that the lockdown policy had only marginal and short-run benefits for public health.\n\nDespite the surge of COVID-19 information, including the knowledge that generally speaking only a particular small subset of the population was especially vulnerable, government officials and politicians made no significant change to the lockdown policy. The same ineffective but extremely costly policies were repeated over and over. Furthermore, the enforcement of lockdown policies increased over time despite the overall decline in the lethalness of the virus and the increased abilities to treat it.\n\nI argue that this behaviour was the result of a “double down” political equilibrium. For various reasons, governments around the world panicked in February and March of 2020 and concluded that only a severe lockdown could isolate the virus and stop it from spreading. They quickly became aware of the failure and cost of this action and were faced with a choice: they could admit their terrible mistake or double down, continue with the policy, and hope that an endemic state would come soon. When a second wave of the virus returned in the fall of 2020, the dominant strategy of those jurisdictions that had earlier locked down was to repeat their lockdown policy. This strategy continued until the widespread infections caused by the Omicron variant led to an endemic state and allowed for a declaration of lockdown victory.\n\nThe double-down strategy required political support, and this came mostly from two sources: the “laptop class” and other winners from the lockdown; and those terrified enough by the virus that they believed lockdowns were justified. This explains three observations over the first two years of the pandemic. First, the response to COVID-19 has led to large increases in economic inequality. Increased inequality means that the relative positions of those at the top have increased, giving this group more power in the competition for goods and services. Second, there was, from the beginning, a massive campaign of fear-mongering that created false assessments of the actual risk of the virus by the general population. Third, the enforcement of lockdowns and other mandates increased over time.\n\nThe Omicron variant did two things. First, it entered the homes of a large fraction of the population and demonstrated the actual risk of the virus at that stage of the pandemic. This led to protests and rebellions as the truth became disseminated. Second, by infecting so many it allowed States to declare that the virus had become endemic. Thus, despite a sixth wave from the BA.2 variant lockdowns came to an end.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/scicheck-what-weve-learned-about-so-called-lockdowns-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/', 'Headline': ""What We've Learned About So-Called 'Lockdowns' and the COVID-19 ..."", 'Snippet': 'A study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive ...', 'Full_text': ""The working paper calculates mortality impact estimates for each of the seven studies aiming to show the effect of the average mandated restrictions in Europe and the United States early in the pandemic compared with a policy of only recommendations. The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

But it was a collective public policy failure, as Newsom observed.', 'Full_text': '“I think we would have done everything differently,” California Governor Gavin Newsom recently told NBC, conceding that strong criticisms of his state’s strict COVID-19 lockdown policies were “legitimate” in hindsight.\n\nLooking in the rear-view mirror, the strict COVID-19 lockdowns, pursued in California and other states, were indeed a disaster. But it was a collective public policy failure, as Newsom observed. Public officials have a responsibility to look back and revisit what they knew—or should have known—before they proposed or implemented the various lockdown policies recommended by federal officials. The often draconian social and economic measures that many state officials imposed, including extended school closures and business shutdowns, resulted in multiple costly consequences that will plague Americans for a long time.\n\nThat’s why congressional investigators should take a deeper dive into the rationale behind federal officials’ guidance on COVID-19 lockdowns. States, especially where the toughest restrictions were implemented, should follow suit. Such reviews could help lawmakers avoid ill-advised government overreach when the next pandemic comes along.\n\nCOVID Lockdown Data. Peer-reviewed work of an international team of researchers led by Dr. Steve Hanke, professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, Did Lockdowns Work? The Verdict on COVID Restrictions, offers some good insight. A comprehensive literature review, the first study of its kind over a broad range of countries, by Hanke, Dr. Lars Jonung of Sweden’s Lund University, and Dr. Jonas Herby of the Center for Political Studies in Denmark, examined over 19,000 studies but focused on 22 relevant studies with actual mortality data. Their “meta-analysis” examined the specific relationship of mortality to various lockdown restrictions, including mandatory stay-at-home orders, business and school closures, and mask mandates, especially in the workplace.\n\n>>> COVID-19 ORIGINS: Experts Consulted by Fauci Suddenly Changed Their Minds\n\nHanke and his colleagues examined the specific impact of certain government mandates exclusively on mortality. Among other findings, they concluded that stay-at-home orders reduced COVID mortality between 1.4 and 4.1 percent; business closures by 7.5 percent; school closures between 2.5 percent and 6.2 percent; and mask mandates, particularly in the workplace, by 18.7 percent.\n\nLooking at the aggregate impact of these restrictions across Europe and the United States, Hanke and colleagues found that “...lockdowns in the Spring of 2020 in Europe resulted in 6000 to 23,000 deaths avoided. To put those numbers in to context, during an average flu season, approximately 72,000 are recorded in Europe. Our results made clear that lockdowns had negligible public health effects when measured by mortality.”\n\nCOVID Masking Data. In a 2023 study, a team of researchers publishing in the Cochrane Review conducted the most comprehensive literature review (78 studies) on masking to date and concluded: “There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks. The low to moderate certainty of evidence means our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and the true effect may be different from the observed estimate of the effect. The pooled results of RCTs (Random Controlled Trials) did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with the with the use of medical /surgical masks.” Random controlled trials are the “gold standard” of academic research.\n\nThe Cochrane researchers did note that there is a further need for “large, well -designed” studies in multiple setting and populations, as well as levels of “adherence,” to get a better understanding of the effectiveness of masking. Hanke and his colleagues agree with the need for future research in this specific area.\n\nThe Swedish Experience. It is particularly noteworthy that officials in Sweden followed far less restrictive policies than European and American officials. They emphasized public information and voluntary compliance with public health recommendations, notably social distancing. Writing in The Frontiers of Public Health (2023), researchers recently reported: “Existing official statistics at both the European and global levels regarding total COVID-19 associated and excess overall mortality rates suggest that Sweden was less affected than most comparable countries that implemented stricter lockdown measures.”\n\nPut into broader context, Hanke and colleagues observe, “Social distancing works. If you keep distance from others, your risk of being infected with a communicable disease is reduced. However, that fact that social distancing works does not imply that compulsory non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), commonly known as ‘lockdowns—policies that restrict internal movement, close schools and businesses, ban international travel and/or other activities—work.”\n\nCensorship of Science. An academic consensus on the impact of lockdowns does not, however, exist. For example, the British Royal Society published a 2023 study that concludes that the lockdowns did indeed contain the viral contagion and reduce mortality. Hanke and colleagues dispute the Royal Society conclusions because of its methodological flaws, specifically lumping together the effects of government mandates and voluntary compliance.\n\nPreviously, Hanke and colleagues published the methodological protocol for their research project in July 2021 in the Social Science Research Network(SSRN), a prominent academic platform for research papers. On March 2022, the SSRN published a critique of the paper, but in August 2023 refused to publish a reply by Hanke and his colleagues.\n\nBecause academic freedom is essential to the advancement of science, censoring or “deplatforming” academic debate is obviously unacceptable, especially in public health, where the safety of the public is so often dependent on the quality of academic research. Congress has a broad agenda for COVID-19 oversight. It should not overlook the consequences of censorship or suppression of scientific dissent.\n\n>>> Enough Is Enough: COVID Oversight Requires Tougher Congressional Action\n\nThere is rarely a binary choice between protecting public health and preserving some semblance of social and economic normalcy. Public health is not only threatened by viral contagion, but also by draconian social and economic lockdowns.\n\nAs Dr. Daniel Johnson, former president of the American Medical Association, counseled at the inception of the pandemic: The tough policy job is to protect lives and livelihoods, a prudential balancing that can preserve public health in a holistic fashion.\n\nToo often that has not happened. In his book The Contagion Next Time, Dr. Sandro Galea, Dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, recounts his own research work on the effect of lockdowns on public health: “We found that lockdowns and socially restrictive policies can undermine health in both the short and long terms, creating particular challenges for vulnerable populations. Our work suggested that the harmful consequences of such policies should be considered in decision-making about pandemic response.”\n\nToday, few dispute the negative consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown policies: major economic disruption and massive unemployment; the closure of hundreds of thousands of businesses and the loss of small businesses, including minority businesses; unprecedented increases in federal deficit spending and debt; severe damage to childhood education; aggravated economic and educational inequality; social isolation and increased mental health problems; and, of course, loss of personal freedom.\n\nPersonally, Dr. Galea leans Left, but as a research scientist he rightly emphasizes that sound public health policy is not, and should not be, an ideological issue. Progress is dependent upon competent assessment of the evidence, open scientific debate and sound data—all of it.

Are they worth massive job and income losses?\n\nA new University of Michigan-led study shows the lockdowns implemented in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic saved lives — but the decision to use lockdowns is much more nuanced and the research shouldn’t be used to justify lockdowns now or to retroactively endorse that approach, said health economist Olga Yakusheva, associate professor of nursing at the School of Nursing.\n\nThe study found that from March through August 2020, implementing widespread lockdowns and other mitigation in the United States potentially saved more lives (866,350 to 1,711,150) than the number of lives potentially lost (57,922 to 245,055) that were attributable to the economic downturn.\n\nHowever, the results are more ambiguous when looking at the quality-adjusted life expectancy added by lockdown (4,886,214 to 9,650,886) vs. quality-adjusted life years lost (2,093,811 to 8,858,444) due to the economic downturn.\n\nThis is because many of the people saved were high-risk older adults with multiple illnesses and fewer healthy years left to live, while those most affected by the economy were younger people in service jobs and other lower-paying occupations who found themselves without employer-provided health insurance and, in many cases, unable to pay for health care or even life-saving medications. A quality adjusted life year is one year of life in perfect health.\n\nThe study, published in PLOS One, should not be used to justify more lockdown measures, Yakusheva said. Nor is it a retroactive endorsement of the strict economic lockdown approach the United States imposed during the first six months of the pandemic.\n\n“We evaluated the full packet of public health measures as it was implemented in the beginning of the pandemic, but lesser mitigation measures may have worked just as well to reduce lives lost,” Yakusheva said. “The fact is, we just will never know. At the time, we had to work with the information that we had. We knew the pandemic was deadly, and we did not have therapeutics or a vaccine.”\n\nThe situation has changed dramatically since the pandemic began, and we have more tools to battle the virus, Yakusheva said. Vaccines and therapeutics are available, as are other mitigation measures.\n\nThis is the first known paper to measure the effect of pandemic lockdown mitigation measures on lives saved and lost, as opposed to typical economic evaluations, which examine the cost per life saved, she said.\n\n“This is tough for people to agree upon. Typically, people are in one of two camps — pragmatics who worry about the economy and ethicists who say any amount of money is worth saving a life,” Yakusheva said. “Some value loved ones more, or their own lives. It’s very subjective.\n\n“What we did was look at empirical correlations between loss of income and mortality, and created a range of estimates on how many people could be expected to die as a result of the downturn, which is essentially the estimated collateral damage of the public health measures. What our analysis did was to allow us an apples-to-apples comparison of lives saved vs. lives lost.”\n\nThere are important study limitations. Chief among them are that some answers to major questions were unobserved — for instance, how many lives would have been lost had COVID-19 been unmitigated. In other words, if it had just run its course with no public health measures in place.\n\n“We know how many people died with public health measures in place, but we can’t know how many people would have died without those measures in place,” Yakusheva said.\n\nThe team estimated that number based on published literature, and the accuracy of that literature, or the public’s behavior, could lead to an over or underestimate.\n\nAlso, all of the human toll of the lockdown won’t be seen immediately. For example, the health toll could manifest later as disease progression because someone who was unemployed couldn’t buy medications.\n\n“We tried to be very careful and produced a range of numbers of lives potentially saved and lost, and we hope the true numbers lie within those ranges,” Yakusheva said.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-no-support-for-viral-claim-that-covid-19-lockdowns-are-returning-this-fall/', 'Headline': 'No Support for Viral Claim That COVID-19 ‘Lockdowns’ Are Returning This ...', 'Snippet': 'No Basis for Returning COVID-19 Restrictions. A TSA spokesperson denied Jones’ claims, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — not TSA — is the federal agency ...', 'Full_text': 'SciCheck Digest\n\nThe U.S. is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases, so it may be prudent for people to wear masks when out in public and take a few extra precautions. But the government is not planning to implement mask mandates or “lockdowns,” despite claims from the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n\nFull Story\n\nIn recent weeks, COVID-19 cases, as estimated from wastewater data, and COVID-19 hospitalizations have been on the rise in the U.S. This comes as the omicron variant EG.5, recently designated as a “variant of interest” by the World Health Organization, became the newly dominant variant in the country.\n\nThis has led some public health experts to suggest that some people — especially those at higher risk of severe COVID-19 — wear masks when out in public, and to be a bit more cautious about contracting the coronavirus.\n\nIn a few limited instances, colleges and companies have announced they will be requiring masks for the time being.\n\nBut contrary to many viral social media posts, there is no indication that any kind of government-ordered COVID-19 restrictions are about to begin.\n\nIn an Aug. 18 episode of “The Alex Jones Show,” the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed sources within the federal government told him “new lockdowns are coming.”\n\nSpecifically, he said a “high level manager” in the Transportation Security Administration told him that by mid-September, TSA and airport employees would be required to wear masks due to concerns over “the new variant in Canada.” By mid-October, everyone would have to wear masks on airplanes, he said. He added that the public should expect by December a return to “full COVID protocols.”\n\nJones then claimed that he called a source within Customs and Border Protection after hearing this, and the source allegedly told him to expect “COVID protocols” to begin rolling out in mid-September and to “get ready for a whole new rollout of what happened before.”\n\nThe episode was headlined on Jones’ website InfoWars as “Federal Officials Blow the Whistle on Biden’s Plan for New COVID Lockdowns.”\n\nJones is best known for his false claim that the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 was fake. Last fall, he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamatory damages to the families of the victims as a result of his falsehoods. Jones is also a prolific spreader of COVID-19 misinformation, among other topics.\n\nClips of Jones’ show began circulating online, and dubious websites such as the Gateway Pundit, which frequently traffics in misinformation, and others reported on the “news,” helping to spread the claims on social media. An associated rallying cry, “do not comply,” briefly trended on X, the platform previously known as Twitter. Others have since repeated the claims.\n\nWhether from Jones or not, the rumor that COVID-19 restrictions might be coming back has since been picked up by some politicians.\n\n“If bureaucrats try to reinstate any COVID tyranny measures, resist them with a vengeance,” tweeted Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky on Aug. 25. “Do not comply.”\n\nNo Basis for Returning COVID-19 Restrictions\n\nA TSA spokesperson denied Jones’ claims, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — not TSA — is the federal agency responsible for transportation mask requirements.\n\n“TSA is unaware of such a requirement,” the spokesperson told us in an email. “There was no TSA meeting on the topic.”\n\nThe CDC similarly said the claims were untrue. “These rumors are utterly false,” Nick Spinelli, a CDC spokesperson, told us in an email.\n\nMoreover, all the talk of the Biden administration reimposing “lockdowns” is not even legally feasible. “The restrictions that were put into place on businesses, on going to the movie theater, on going to the retail mall … all of those were done by states and local governments, not the federal government,” Wendy E. Parmet, a public health law expert at Northeastern University, told us in a phone interview.\n\nThe federal government did advise states on restrictions, including when to lift them, and guided Americans on what they should and should not do to stay safe. But ultimately, these were just suggestions.\n\n“It’s conspiracy thinking and it’s catastrophizing,” Parmet said of Jones’ claims.\n\nParmet added that the restrictions in the U.S., which included business closures and limits on gathering sizes, were not true lockdowns, such as those imposed in China. “The ‘lockdown’ terminology is certainly a misnomer,” she said.\n\nParmet said that legally, TSA probably could impose mask mandates on its employees, but those would not extend to all airport workers or to passengers. That would be a “labor law issue,” she said, and there might be pushback from the union.\n\nThe CDC’s ability to impose a face mask mandate during travel has been contested in court. (Parmet is one of many public health and public health law experts who signed an amicus brief supporting the CDC on this issue.)\n\nThe CDC’s previous order expired due to the end of the public health emergency in May and had already become unenforceable in April 2022 due to a court order.\n\n“I think CDC would be extremely wary, and I suspect that the Biden administration will be exceptionally wary right now … for both litigation and political reasons to go down that route unless they feel it is absolutely essential,” Parmet said.\n\nSpinelli noted that the CDC “continues to recommend that all people—passengers and transportation workers, alike—are up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines before they travel and take steps to protect yourself and others.” That can include wearing a mask, if you so choose, when using public transit — but it is not mandated.\n\nThe agency currently advises higher-risk people and their contacts to mask up when a person’s county-level hospital admission level is “medium.” When it’s “high,” everyone is advised to wear a high-quality mask or respirator, such as an N95, and higher-risk people are advised to avoid “non-essential indoor activities in public.” But again, these are just recommendations.\n\nAs of Aug. 12, no counties are listed as “high,” and fewer than 3% are “medium.”\n\nSome experts have criticized tying public health recommendations to hospital admissions, as this is a lagging indicator, and the warning to take more precautions may come too late for many people.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection did not respond to an inquiry about Jones’ claims with any information by the time of publication.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 28: CBP told us the agency follows CDC guidelines and that “[c]laims that CBP has plans to independently reintroduce COVID-19 protocols are false.”\n\nSome Concern from New Variants, But No Expectation of a Return to 2020\n\nScientists and public health officials have been watching two newer coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, variants: EG.5 and BA.2.86.\n\nEG.5, which the CDC estimates made up about a fifth of all coronavirus cases in the U.S. in the past couple of weeks, is a spinoff of XBB.1.9.2, another omicron variant. In this regard, it doesn’t appear to be that different from its immediate predecessors, although it may be a bit more transmissible and more readily able to evade immunity, which could explain its current rise. There isn’t evidence that the variant causes more severe disease.\n\n“Collectively, available evidence does not suggest that EG.5 has additional public health risks relative to the other currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 descendent lineages,” the WHO concluded in an Aug. 9 risk evaluation report.\n\nAn updated COVID-19 booster, which targets the XBB.1.5 variant, is expected to be available in late September or early October. Because EG.5 is quite similar to XBB.1.5, experts anticipate that the updated vaccine will provide good protection against this variant.\n\nThe other variant, BA.2.86, is an omicron descendant, but has many more mutations that make it considerably different. As Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, put it on X, its high number of mutations “makes it an evolutionary jump comparable in size to that which originally gave rise to Omicron.”\n\nOnly a small number of BA.2.86 cases have been identified in the U.S. or elsewhere, but mutation analyses indicate the variant may be especially able to evade immune defenses. It is still too soon to know whether the variant causes more severe disease or is more transmissible, according to the CDC. The variant, however, has been identified in many countries, suggesting it has some ability to spread.\n\nEven if BA.2.86 does turn out to be the next big variant, it would not be the same as 2020, when the entire world was susceptible to the coronavirus, with no kind of prior immunity and no vaccine available.\n\nThe forthcoming updated vaccine may be less effective against BA.2.86 than against other variants, but the CDC expects it will still work to reduce severe disease and hospitalization, which is the primary goal. This makes it highly unlikely that the U.S. would have to impose restrictions similar to those early in the pandemic, even if there is a bad COVID-19 surge and public health officials encourage people to take extra precautions.\n\n“We aren’t returning to March 2020; our immune systems will still recognize the highly mutated variant, albeit suboptimally,” epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina wrote in her Substack about the possible risks of BA.2.86. “This will protect a lot of us from severe disease.”\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s articles providing accurate health information and correcting health misinformation are made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

But even that policy did more harm than good, they argued, citing several of the lockdowns’ “devastating effects.”\n\n“They have contributed to reducing economic activity, raising unemployment, reducing schooling, causing political unrest, contributing to domestic violence, and undermining liberal democracy,” the report read.\n\nIn other words, the lockdowns were a failure that might have cost more lives than they saved.

Depression rates tripled in adults in all demographic groups, and suicide attempts among young children and teenagers skyrocketed.\n\nOur response to the pandemic has had severe consequences, and it is well past time for the public health officials who engineered it to admit as much.

These terms can guide users to data voids on search engines, where only one point of an unreliable view is represented. Low-quality news sources also often re-use stories from each other, polluting search engine results with other similar non-credible stories. It was previously argued (page 75 of ref. 30) that the media dynamics in the United States (particularly on the right) “tend to reinforce partisan statements, irrespective of their truth”. Tripodi31 shows how Google’s search algorithms interact with conservative elite messaging strategies to push audiences towards extreme and, at times, false views.

The topics and framing of false/misleading news stories are also often distinct from those covered by mainstream outlets, which could limit the amount of reliable news sources being returned by search engines when searching for information about these stories. Finally, direct fact-checks may be difficult to find given that most false narratives are never fact-checked at all and, for stories that are evaluated by organizations such as Snopes or PolitiFact, these fact-checks may not be posted in the immediate aftermath of a false article’s publication. As a result, it would not be surprising that exposure to unreliable news is particularly prevalent when searching online about recently published misinformation.\n\nTo investigate the prevalence and effect of exposure to unreliable information while searching for information online, study 5 combines survey data with digital trace data. In this final randomized controlled trial (between-respondents study), we collected articles using the same article-selection protocol and, as in study 1, asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles within 72 h of publication and in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was required to search online using Google before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity, whereas the control group was not. For those in the treatment group, we collect the URLs that they visited and the top ten Google search engine results to which they were exposed by means of a custom-made browser plug-in that respondents consented to install. Over this 12 day study, we recruited 1,677 respondents living in the United States through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and presented them with three highly popular articles from mainstream and low-quality sources within 72 h of publication. Over the course of this study, 17 false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in the control (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and treatment (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents) groups. By asking the respondents in both the control and treatment groups to install a custom web extension that collected their web browsing behaviour, we were able to collect digital trace data associated with 73% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the treatment group and 91% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the control group. This differential attrition was probably due to technical differences between the extension used by the treatment and control groups, but does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey across the groups (further analysis, including difference in means testing, is provided in the Methods). We still collected the survey results for all of the respondents regardless of compliance and used these responses for the analyses in Fig. 2b. We excluded non-compliant responses from our analysis only when we analysed the effect of the quality of search engine results. We excluded all non-compliant respondents in these analyses to limit possible selection effects, but these respondents were included in all of the other analyses.\n\nFigure 2a presents the proportion of the treatment group’s search queries about true and false/misleading articles that return at least one unreliable news source in their Google search engine results. To assess the reliability of a news source, we used classifications from the NewsGuard service, which provides reliability and trustworthiness scores from journalists available at the time of the study (August 2021). Sites with a score of below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score above 60 are deemed to be reliable; a histogram of NewsGuard scores for the majority of online news domains is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1 in Supplementary Information C. Figure 2a shows that search queries about true articles are much less likely to return unreliable news among search results than search queries about false/misleading articles (22.5 percentage point difference, F = 105.8, P < 0.0001). Only 15% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about true articles, whereas 38% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about false/misleading news.\n\nUsing evaluations from study 5, we measured the effect of searching online on the belief in false articles. Figure 2b presents the treatment effect (encouraged to search online) on the probability of believing misinformation using both a dichotomous outcome (rating a false/misleading story as true: 1, yes; 0, no), a seven-point ordinal scale of veracity and a four-point ordinal scale. Like the previous four studies, we found that those who search online about misinformation were more likely to believe false news stories to be true than those who did not. We found that the effect of SOTEN is greater than in the previous studies, which we suspect may be due to the fact that the search treatment is likely stronger in this study relative to the others given that we could verify compliance for full compensation. In this final study, searching online increased the probability that a respondent rated a false or misleading article as true by 0.107 (P = 0.0143, Cohen’s D = 0.21, n = 1,485). Searching online also increased the average score by 0.16 (P = 0.0434, Cohen’s D = 0.16, n = 1,485) on a four-point ordinal scale, but not on a seven-point ordinal scale (P = 0.201, Cohen’s D = 0.10, n = 1,485). We present the differential effect of SOTEN by political ideology in Extended Data Fig. 2 (explanation for how the ideology of each respondent and the ideological perspective of each article is measured can be found in Supplementary Information I and L).\n\nUsing digital trace data collected through the custom browser plug-in, we are able to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation among those exposed to unreliable and reliable information by search engines. To this end, we measured the effect of being encouraged to search online on the belief in misinformation for our control group and two subsets of the treatment group: those who were exposed to Google search engine results that returned unreliable results (defined as at least 10% of links coming from news sources with a NewsGuard score below 60) or very reliable results (defined as the first ten links coming only from sources with a NewsGuard score above 85). Roughly 42% of all evaluations in the treatment group fit in either of these two subsets; although subsetting the data in this way ignores 58% of the treatment group, we are interested in the effect of search among groups exposed to very different levels of information quality. Our next analysis looks at the whole set of responses. Across these two subsets, Fig. 2c shows that the probability that an individual believes false/misleading news stories to be true is substantially higher in the treatment group than the control group among respondents whose news exposure is composed of at least 10% unreliable news sites (n = 1,027, P = 0.0035, Cohen’s D = 0.29), but it is not higher among those in the treatment group who are only exposed to very reliable news sites (n = 940, P = 0.926, Cohen’s D = 0.01) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.147) in favour of the null hypothesis). These results are consistent with the theory that lower-quality search engine results can increase belief in misinformation by returning low-quality results. As further evidence, in Fig. 2d, we used the entire sample and calculated the probability of rating misinformation as true by quartile of the mean news quality across the top ten links returned by Google during the evaluation, leading to similar results. Figure 2d shows that respondents who are exposed to search engine results with the lowest-quality news are more likely to rate false/misleading news as true (n = 1,006, P = 0.0241) compared with those who are not asked to search, whereas those who are exposed to the highest-quality news are not more likely to rate a false/misleading article as true than those in the control group (n = 1,008, P = 0.420) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.182) in favour of the null hypothesis). This again suggests that exposure to unreliable news may explain why SOTEN increases belief in misinformation. Moreover, we found that respondents who are exposed to the top half of information quality in our sample information (top 50%) are no more likely to believe misinformation than those in the control group (n = 1,113, P = 0.429) (we confirmed this null finding using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.103) in favour of the null hypothesis). To be clear, the information returned by the Google search results is post-treatment, so this analysis does not infer a causal relationship32, but it provides evidence consistent with the theory that low-quality information returned by search engines could explain the search effect that we identify. Note that we did not find a statistically significant differential effect of low-quality information on belief across different levels of ideological congruence to the news article (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\nIf our proposed explanation is indeed correct and exposure to low-quality search results is associated with belief in misinformation, it remains unclear why certain individuals are exposed to low-quality news sources whereas others are not. In the next section, we investigate the search terms that individuals use to see whether this is associated with exposure to low-quality results. Specifically, we consider whether evidence from our study is consistent with two plausible interpretations for why individuals use search terms that are more likely to return low-quality information: ideological congruence with the perspective of the misinformation and digital literacy.\n\nIn all six studies, we received informed consent from all of the participants. We also excluded participants for inattentiveness. The researchers were not blinded to the hypotheses when carrying out the analyses. All experiments were randomized. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.\n\nThe preregistration for studies 1 and 2 is available online (https://osf.io/akemx/). The methods that we use for all six studies are based on the analysis outlined by this preregistration. It specified that all analyses would be performed at the level of the individual item (that is, one data point per item per participant) using linear regression with standard errors clustered on the participant. The linear regression was preregistered to have a belief in misinformation dummy variable (1 = false/misleading article rated as ‘true’; 0 = article rated as ‘false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’) as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: treatment dummy (1 = treatment group; 0 = control group), education (1 = no high school degree; 2 = high school degree; 3 = associates degree; 4 = bachelors degree; 5 = masters degree; 6 = doctorate degree), age, income (0 = US$0–50,000; 1 = US$50,000–100,000; 2 = US$100,000–150,000; 3 = US$150,000+), gender (1 = self-identify as female; 0 = self-identify as not female) and ideology (−3 = extremely liberal; −2 = liberal; −1 = slightly liberal; 0 = moderate; 1 = slightly conservative; 2 = conservative; 3 = extremely conservative). A full description of our variables used in studies 1–4 and study 5 is provided in Supplementary Information I and J. We also stated that we would repeat the main analysis using seven-point ordinal form (1,: definitely false to 7, definitely true) in addition to our categorical dummy variable. Our key prediction stated that the treatment—encouraging individuals to search online—would increase belief in misinformation, which is the hypothesis tested in this study.\n\nHowever, such an analysis does not account for the likely heterogenous treatment effect across articles evaluated or whether the respondent was ideologically congruent to the perspective of the article. Given this, we deviated from our preregistered plan on two distinct points: (1) to control for the likely heterogeneity in our treatment effect across articles, we add article fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at the article level45 in addition to at the individual level; and (2) we replace the ideology variable with a dummy variable that accounts for whether an individual’s ideological perspective is congruent with the article’s perspective. Given that the congruence of one’s ideological perspective with that of the article, and not ideology per se, likely affects belief in misinformation, we think that this is the proper variable to use. Although we deviate from these aspects of the preregistered analysis, the results for studies 1–4 using this preregistered model are provided in Extended Data Fig. 8. The results from these models support the hypothesis even more strongly than the results that we present in the main text of this paper.\n\nArticle-selection process\n\nTo distribute a representative sample of highly popular news articles directly after publication to respondents, we created a transparent, replicable and preregistered article-selection process that sourced highly popular false/misleading and true articles from across the ideological spectrum to be evaluated by respondents within 24–48 h of their publication. In study 4 (in which we sent only articles about COVID-19 to respondents), we delayed sending the articles to respondents for an additional 24 h to enable us to receive the assessment from our professional fact-checkers before sending the articles out to respondents. Doing so enabled us to communicate fact-checker assessments to respondents once they had completed their own assessment, therefore reducing the chance of causing medical harm by misinforming a survey participant about the pandemic.\n\nWe sourced one article per day from each of the following five news streams: liberal mainstream news domains; conservative mainstream news domains; liberal low-quality news domains; conservative low-quality news domains; and low-quality news domains with no clear political orientation. Each day, we chose the most popular online articles from these five streams that had appeared in the previous 24 h and sent them to respondents who were recruited either through Qualtrics (studies 1–4) or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (study 5). An explanation of our sampling technique on Qualtrics and Mechanical Turk, why we chose the services and why we believe that these results can be generalized is provided in Supplementary Information D. Collecting and distributing the most popular false articles directly after publication is a key innovation that enabled us to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation during the period in which people are most likely to consume it. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication.\n\nTo generate our streams of mainstream news, we collected the top 100 news sites by US consumption identified by Microsoft Research’s Project Ratio between 2016 and 2019. To classify these websites as liberal or conservative, we used scores of media partisanship from a previous study46, which assigns ideological estimates to websites on the basis of the URL-sharing behaviour of social media users: websites with a score of below zero were classified as liberal and those above zero were classified as conservative. The top ten websites in each group (liberal or conservative) by consumption were then chosen to create a liberal mainstream and conservative mainstream news feed. For our low-quality news sources, we relied on the list of low-quality news sources from a previous study3 that were still active at the start of our study in November 2019. We subsequently classified all low-quality sources into three streams: liberal leaning sources, conservative leaning sources and those with no clear partisan orientation. The list of the sources in all five streams, as well as an explanation for how the ideology for low-quality sources was determined, is provided in Supplementary Information E (Supplementary Tables 67–71).\n\nOn each day of studies 1, 2 and 5, we selected the most popular article from the past 24 h. We used CrowdTangle, a content discovery and social monitoring platform that tracks the popularity of URLs on Facebook pages, for the mainstream sources, and RSS feeds, for the low-quality sources, from each of the five streams. We used RSS feeds for the low-quality sources instead of CrowdTangle because the Facebook pages of most low-quality sources had been banned and were therefore not tracked by CrowdTangle. Articles chosen by this algorithm therefore represent the most popular credible and low-quality news from across the ideological spectrum. The number of public Twitter (recently renamed X) posts and public Facebook group posts that contained each article in studies 1, 2 and 3 is provided in Supplementary Tables 72 and 73 in Supplementary Information G. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication. In study 4, to test whether this search effect is robust to news stories related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we sampled only the most popular articles of which the central claim covered the health, economic, political or social effects of COVID-19. During study 4 and 5, we also added a list of low-quality news sources known to publish pandemic-related misinformation, which was compiled by NewsGuard.\n\nIt is important to note that we are testing the search effect during the time period in which our studies run (from study 1 in late 2019 to study 5 in late 2021). It is possible that, over time, the online information environment may change as the result of new search strategies and/or search algorithms.\n\nSurveys\n\nIn each study, we sent out an online survey that asked respondents a battery of questions related to the daily articles that had been selected by our article-selection protocol, as well as a litany of demographic questions. While they completed the survey within the Qualtrics platform, they viewed the articles directly on the website where they had been originally published. Respondents evaluated each article using a variety of criteria, the most germane of which was a categorical evaluation question: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” to which respondents could choose from three responses: (1) true; (2) misleading/false; and (3) could not determine. The respondents were also asked to assess the accuracy of the news article on a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (definitely not true) to 7 (definitely true). In study 5, we also asked the respondents to evaluate articles based on a four-point ordinal scale: “to the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the central claim in the article?” (1) Not at all accurate; (2) not very accurate; (3) somewhat accurate; and (4) Very accurate.\n\nWe ran our analyses using both categorical responses and the ordinal scale(s). To assess the reliability and validity of both measures, we predict the rating of an article on a seven-point scale using a dummy variable measuring whether that respondent rated that article as true on the categorical measure using a simple linear regression. We found that, across each study, rating an article as true on average increases the veracity scale rating on average by 2.75 points on the seven-point scale (approximately 1.5 s.d. of the ratings on the ordinal scale). The full results are shown in Extended Data Fig. 9. To ensure that responses that we use were actually from respondents who evaluated articles in good faith, two relatively simple attention checks for each article, which do not depend on any ability associated with the evaluation task, were used. If a respondent failed any of these attention checks, all of their evaluations were omitted from this analysis. These attention check questions can be found in Supplementary Information F.\n\nDetermining the veracity of articles\n\nOne of the key challenges in this study was determining the veracity of the article in the period directly after publication. Whereas many studies use source quality as a proxy for article quality, not all articles from suspect news sites are actually false3. Other studies have relied on professional fact-checking organizations such as Snopes or Politifact to identify false/misleading stories from these sources47,48. However, the use of evaluations from these organization is impossible when sourcing articles in real time because we have no way of knowing whether these articles will ever be checked by such organizations. As an alternative evaluation mechanism, we hired six professional fact checkers from leading national media organizations to also assess each article during the same 24 h period as respondents. In studies 4 and 5, given the onset of the pandemic and the potential harm caused by medical misinformation, the professional fact-checkers rated the articles 24 h before the respondents so that we could show respondents the fact-checkers’ ratings of each article immediately after completion of the survey. These professional fact-checkers were recruited from a diverse group of reputable publications (none of the fact-checkers were employed by a publication included in our studies to ensure no conflicts of interest) and were paid US$10.00 per article. The modal response of the professional fact checkers yielded 37 false/misleading, 102 true and 16 indeterminate articles from study 1. Most articles were evaluated by five fact-checkers; a few were evaluated by four or six. A different group of six fact-checkers evaluated all of the articles during studies 4 and 5 relative to studies 1–3. We use the modal response of the professional fact checkers to determine whether we code an article as ‘true’, ’false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’. We are then able to assess the ability of our respondents to identify the veracity of an article by comparing their response to the modal professional fact checker response. In terms of inter-rater reliability among fact-checkers, we report a Fleiss’ Kappa score of 0.42 for all fact-checker evaluations of articles used in this paper. We also report the article-level agreement between each pair of fact-checkers and average weighted Cohen kappa score between each pair of fact-checkers in Supplementary Table 74 in Supplementary Information K. These scores are reported for the articles that were rated by five professional fact-checkers. Although this level of agreement is quite low, it is slightly higher than other studies that have used professional fact-checkers to rate the veracity of both credible and suspect articles using similar scale our fact-checkers used49. This low level of agreement of professionals over what is misinformation may also explain why so many respondents believe misinformation and why searching online does not effectively reduce this problem. Identifying misinformation is a difficult task, even for professionals.\n\nWe also present all of the analyses in this paper using only false/misleading articles with a robust mode—which we define as any modal response of fact-checkers that would not change if one professional fact-checker changed their response—to remove articles where there was higher levels of disagreement among professional fact-checkers. These results can be found in Supplementary Table 74 Supplementary Information K. We found that the direction of our results does not change when using the false/misleading articles with a robust mode, although the effect is no longer statistically significant for 2 out of the 4 studies using the categorical measure and 1 out of the 4 studies using the continuous measure. To determine whether the search effect changes with the rate of agreement of fact-checkers, we ran an interaction model and present the results in Extended Data Fig. 10. We found that the search effect does appear to weaken for articles that fact-checkers most agree are false/misleading. Put another way, the search effect is strongest for articles in which there is less fact-checker agreement that the article is false, suggesting that online search may be especially ineffective when the veracity of articles is most difficult to ascertain. Although this is the case, the search effect for only false/misleading articles with a robust mode (one fact-checker changing their decision from false/misleading to true will not change the modal fact-checker evaluation) is still quite consistent and strong. These results are presented in Supplementary Figs. 2–5 in Supplementary Information M.\n\nStudy 1\n\nIn study 1, we tested whether SOTEN affects belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran for 10 days. During this study, we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window, but asked only one of the groups to do this after searching online. We preregistered a hypothesis that both false/misleading and true news were more likely to be rated as true by those who were encouraged to search online. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nOn ten separate days (21 November 2019 to 7 January 2020), we randomly assigned a group of respondents to be encouraged to search online before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity. Over these 10 days, 13 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not requested to search online (resulting in 1,145 evaluations from 876 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were requested to search online (resulting in 1,130 evaluations from 872 unique respondents). The articles used during this study can be found in Supplementary Tables 1–5 in Supplementary Information A.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. We then presented the participants with three out of five articles selected that day randomly (no articles could be shown to a respondent more than once). For each article, the respondents in each group were asked a series questions about the article, such as whether it is an opinion article, their interest in the article, and their perceived reliability of the source. Those in the control group were presented with the veracity questions most relevant to this study: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” with the following options: (1) true: the central claim you are evaluating is factually accurate. (2) Misleading and/or false: misleading: the central claim takes out of context, misrepresents or omits evidence. False: the central claim is factually inaccurate. (3) Could not determine: you do not feel you can judge whether the central claim is true, false or misleading. The participants were also asked a seven-point ordinal scale veracity question: “now that you have evaluated the article, we are interested in the strength of your opinion. Please rank the article on the following scale: 1 (definitely not true), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (definitely true)”. Differing from the control group, the participants in the treatment group (encouraged to search for additional information) were given instructions before these two veracity questions (see below). These instructions encouraged them to search online and asked the respondents questions about their search online.\n\nInstructions to find evidence to evaluate central claim\n\nThe following instructions were provided to respondents in studies 1–5 before SOTEN.\n\n“The purpose of this section is to find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating. This evidence should allow you to assess whether the central claim is true, false or somewhere in between. Guidance for the finding evidence for or against the central claim you’ve identified:\n\n(1)\n\nBy evidence, we mean an article, statement, photo, video, audio or statistic relevant to the central claim. This evidence should be reported by some other source than the author of the article you are investigating. This evidence can either support the initial claim or go against it.\n\n(2)\n\nTo find evidence about the claim, you should use a keyword search on a search engine of your choice or within the website of a particular source you trust as an authority on the topic related to the claim you’re evaluating.\n\n(3)\n\nWe ask that you use the highest-quality pieces of evidence to evaluate the central claim in your search. If you cannot find evidence about the claim from a source that you trust, you should try to find the most relevant evidence about the claim you can find from any source, even one you don’t trust.\n\nFor additional instructions explaining how to find evidence please click this text” (these additional instructions are provided in Supplementary Information H, and the instructions that we gave respondents for the extra study omitting some instructions are provided in Supplementary Information O).\n\nWe next presented respondents with the following four questions:\n\n(1)\n\nWhat are the keywords you used to research this original claim? If you searched multiple times, enter just the keywords you used on your final/successful search. If you used a reverse image search, please enter “reverse image search” in the text box.\n\n(2)\n\nWhich of the following best describes the highest quality evidence you found about the claim in your search? Possible responses: (A) I found evidence from a source that I trust. (B) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t know enough about to trust or distrust. (C) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t trust. (D) I did not find evidence about this claim.\n\n(3)\n\nEvidence link: please paste the link for the highest quality evidence you found (paste only the text of the URL link here. Do not include additional text from the webpage/article, etc.). If you did not find any evidence, please type the following phrase in the text box below: “No Evidence”.\n\n(4)\n\nAdditional evidence links: if you use other different evidence sources that are particularly helpful, please paste the additional sources here.\n\nAfter the participants read the instructions and were asked these questions about their online search, those in the treatment group were presented with the two veracity questions of interest (categorical and seven-point ordinal scale). In both the control and treatment conditions, the response options were listed in the same order as they are listed in this section.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was preregistered (https://osf.io/akemx/).\n\nBalance table\n\nSupplementary Table 95 in Supplementary Information Q compares basic demographic variables among respondents in the control and treatment group. This table shows that respondents were similar across demographic variables, except for income. Those in the control group self-reported making higher levels of income than those in the treatment group. We did not record the data for 83.2% of those who entered the survey and were in the control group and 85.8% of those in the treatment group. The majority of respondents dropped out of the survey at the beginning. About 66% of all respondents who entered the survey refused to consent or did not move past the first two consent questions. Taken together, of all of the respondents who moved past the consent questions, 51% of respondents dropped out of the survey in the control group and 58% of the respondents dropped out of the survey in the treatment group. About 11% of those who did not complete the survey did so because they failed the attention checks and were removed from the survey.\n\nStudy 2\n\nStudy 2 ran similarly to study 1, but over 29 days between 18 November 2019 and 6 February 2020. In each survey that was sent in study 1, we asked respondents in the control group to evaluate the third article they received a second time, but only after looking for evidence online (using the same directions to search online that participants in study 1 received).\n\nThis study measures the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation but, instead of running a between-respondent random control trial, we run a within-respondent study. In this study, the participants first evaluated articles without being encouraged to search online. After providing their veracity evaluation on both the categorical and ordinal scales, they were encouraged to search online to help them re-evaluate the article’s veracity using the same instructions as from study 1. This is probably a more difficult test of the effect of searching online, as individuals have already anchored themselves to their previous response. Literature on confirmation bias leads us to believe that new information will have the largest effect when individuals have not already evaluated the news article on its own. Thus study therefore enables us to measure whether the effect of searching online is strong enough to change an individual’s evaluation of a news article after they have evaluated the article on its own. We did not preregister a hypothesis, but we did pose this as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nDuring study 2, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,054 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 96 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nSimilar to study 1, respondents initially evaluated articles as if they were in the control group, but after they finished their evaluation they were then presented with this text: “Now that you have evaluated the article, we would like you evaluate the article again, but this time find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating”. They were then prompted with the same instructions and questions as the treatment group in study 1.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was posed as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1.\n\nStudy 3\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 3, this study replicated study 2 using the same materials and procedure, but was run between 16 March 2020 and 28 April 2020, 3–5 months after the publication of each these articles. This study set out to test whether this search effect remained largely the same months after the publication of misinformation when professional fact-checks and other credible reporting on the topic are hopefully more prevalent. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nIn total, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,011 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 97 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 4\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 4, this study extended study 2 by asking individuals to evaluate and re-evaluate highly popular misinformation strictly about COVID-19 after searching online. This study was run over 8 days between 28 May 2020 to 22 June 2020. In the ‘Article-selection process’ section, we describe the changes that we made in our article-selection process to collect these articles. We collected these articles and sent them out to be evaluated by respondents. This study measured whether the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation still holds for misinformation about a salient event, in this case the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511). This IRB submission is the same as the one used for studies 1, 2 and 3, but it was modified and approved in May 2020 before we sent out articles related to COVID-19.\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nA total of 13 false or misleading unique articles was evaluated and re-evaluated by 386 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online (the treatment) and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 13–17 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 98 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 5\n\nTo test the effect of exposure to unreliable news on belief in misinformation, we ran a fifth and final study that combined survey and digital trace data. This study was almost identical to study 1, but we used a custom plug-in to collect digital trace data and encouraged the respondents to specifically search online using Google (our web browser plug-in could collect search results only from a Google search result page). Similar to study 1, we measured the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran on 12 separate days from 13 July 2021 to 9 November 2021, during which we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was encouraged to search online, while the control group was not. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2021-5608).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nUnlike the other four studies, these respondents were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Only workers within the United States (verified by IP address) and those with above a 95% success rate were allowed to participate. We were unable to recruit a representative sample of Americans using sampling quotas owing to the difficulty of recruiting respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk who were willing to install a web-tracking browser extension in the 24 h period after our algorithm selected articles to be evaluated.\n\nOver 12 days during study 5, a group of respondents were encouraged to SOTEN before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity (treatment) and another group was not encouraged to search online when they evaluated these articles (control). A total of 17 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not encouraged to search online (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were encouraged to search online (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents). The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 18–22 in Supplementary Information A. We do not find statistically significant evidence that respondents who we were recruited to the control group were different on a number of demographic variables. Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q compares those in the treatment and control group. Only 20% of those in the control group who consented to participate in the survey dropped out of the study, whereas 62% of those who entered the survey and were in the treatment group dropped out of the study. This difference in compliance rates can be explained by the difference in the web extension for the treatment group relative to the one given to the control group. For technical reasons related to capturing HTML, the respondents in the treatment group had to wait at least 5 s for the web extension that was installed to collect their Google search engine results, which may have resulted in some respondents accidentally removing the web extension. If they did not wait for 5 s on a Google search results page, the extension would turn off and they would have to turn it back on. These instructions were presented clearly to the respondents, but probably resulted in differences in compliance. This differential attrition does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey in the treatment and control group as shown in Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. Those assigned to the treatment group were then asked to install a web extension that would collect their digital trace data including their Google search history. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. To evaluate these news articles we will ask you to search online using Google about each news article online and then use Google Search results to help you evaluate the news articles. We need you to install the web extension and then search on Google for relevant information pertaining to each article in order for us to compensate you”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate the “Search Engine Results Saver”, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-engine-results-sav/mjdfiochiimhfgbdgkielodbojlpfcbl?hl=en&authuser=2). Those assigned to the control group were also asked to install a web extension that collected their digital trace data, but not any search engine results. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. You must install the extension, log in and keep this extension on for the whole survey to be fully compensated”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate URL Historian, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-historian/imdfbahhoamgbblienjdoeafphlngdim). Both those in the control and treatment group were asked to download and install a web extension that tracked their web behaviour to limit varying levels of attrition across both groups, due to the unwillingness or inability of respondents to install this kind of extension. After the respondents downloaded their respective web extension, the study ran identical to study 1.\n\nDigital trace data\n\nBy asking individuals to download and activate web browsers that collected their URL history and scraped their search engine results, we were able to measure the quality of news they were exposed to when they searched online. We were unable to collect this data if respondents did not search on Google, deactivated their web browser while they were taking the survey, or did not wait on a search engine result page for at least 5 s. Thus, in total for the 653 evaluations of misinformation in our treatment group, we collected Google search results for 508 evaluations (78% of all evaluations). We also collected the URL history of those in the control group, but did not use these data in our analyses. For most demographic characteristics (age, gender, income and education), we have statistically significant evidence that respondents from whom we were able to collect search engine results were slightly different compared with those from whom we were not able to collect these results. We find that participants from whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.8 on a seven-point scale, more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy and less likely to self-identify as female. Supplementary Table 100 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the treatment group. Those compliant in the treatment group were slightly younger by two and a half years and slightly more likely to be male.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nWhen we analysed the effect of the quality of online information, we included only those in the control group who kept their web extension on during the survey to limit possible selection bias effects. In the control group, 93% of the respondents evaluated a false/misleading article in the control group installed the web extension that tracked their own digital trace data throughout the whole survey. Similar to the treatment group, we do find that those for whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.55 on a seven-point scale and more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy. The magnitude of these differences are modest and the direction of these differences are identical to the differences in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 101 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the control group. We do not see large differences in how those who are compliant in the control group differ from those who are compliant in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 102 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying individuals in the treatment and control groups.\n\nTo measure the quality of search results, we use scores from Newsguard, an internet plug-in that informs users whether a site that they are viewing is reliable. NewsGuard employs a team of trained journalists and experienced editors to review and rate news and information websites based on nine criteria. The criteria assess basic practices of journalistic credibility and transparency, assigning a score from 0 to 100. Sites with a score below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score of above 60 are deemed to be reliable. NewsGuard has ratings for over 5,000 online news domains, responsible for about 95% of all the news consumed in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy. More information is available online (https://www.newsguardtech.com). A sample of their ratings can be found online (https://www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/sample-nutrition-labels/). The full list of online news domains and their ratings is licensed by NewsGuard to approved researchers.\n\nStudy 6\n\nStudy 6 tests whether the search effects that we identify on belief in false/misleading and true articles still hold when we change the instructions we present to respondents. To this end, we ran an experiment similar to study 1, but we added two other treatment arms in which we encouraged individuals to search online to evaluate news. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nEthics\n\nWe complied with all relevant ethical regulations. All of the studies were reviewed and approved by the NYU Institutional Review Board (IRB). Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 were approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-351. Study 5 was approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2021-5608. Study 6 was approved by a modified NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-3511. All of the experimental participants provided informed consent before taking part. The participants were given the option to withdraw from the study while the experiment was ongoing as well as to withdraw their data at any time.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://chds.hsph.harvard.edu/cost-ineffectiveness-of-lockdowns/', 'Headline': 'Cost-Ineffectiveness of Lockdowns – Center for Health Decision Science', 'Snippet': 'In the first lockdown, an estimated 1,022 deaths were averted at a total cost of $10.8 billion; in the second lockdown, an estimated 1,970 deaths were averted at a total cost of $5.64 billion.

As vaccines became increasingly available, they replaced lockdowns as a primary prevention strategy in many areas.\n\nPliskin’s and Arbel’s work assessed the impacts of two lockdowns and two vaccination campaigns in Israel and estimated the costs associated with preventing one COVID-19 death. In the first lockdown, an estimated 1,022 deaths were averted at a total cost of $10.8 billion; in the second lockdown, an estimated 1,970 deaths were averted at a total cost of $5.64 billion. This means that the cost to avoid one COVID-19 death via the lockdowns was about $10.6 million and $2.86 million respectively. In contrast, in the primary vaccination campaign, an estimated 4,750 deaths were averted at a total cost of $0.29 billion; in the first booster campaign, 650 deaths were averted at a total cost of $0.015 billion. This means that the cost to avoid one COVID-19 death via vaccination was $60,845 and $22,744 respectively. Thus there is over an order-of-magnitude difference between the strategies. These findings indicate that the most effective and economically efficient strategy is to provide maximal vaccination protection, using mRNA vaccines and boosters.\n\nLearn more: Read BNT162b2 Vaccine Booster and Mortality Due to Covid-19\n\nLearn more: Read Effectiveness of a Second BNT162b2 Booster Vaccine\n\nLearn more: Read A Comprehensive Covid-19 Response – The Need for Economic Evaluation'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://reason.com/2022/02/04/at-high-cost-covid-19-lockdowns-saved-few-lives/', 'Headline': 'At High Cost, COVID-19 Lockdowns Saved Few Lives - Reason.com', 'Snippet': 'At High Cost, COVID-19 Lockdowns Saved Few Lives. “Lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.”. J.D. Tuccille | 2.4.2022 7:00 AM. (Photo by Haydn ...', 'Full_text': 'Restrictive public health measures were sold as temporary trade-offs of liberty for safety from infection. The pitch was that, if we give up freedom of movement, trade, and normal social interaction for a short time, we could beat COVID-19 and then get back to living. But from day one (as Reason has emphasized) the costs to liberty and prosperity have been high for uncertain return. And now researchers present new evidence that the world got very little benefit for the freedom that was taken away.\n\n""Lockdowns in Europe and the United States only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.2% on average,"" finds a meta-analysis of 24 studies published this week by researchers with the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise. The authors were Jonas Herby (with the Danish Center for Political Studies), Lars Jonung (Lund University), and Steve H. Hanke (Johns Hopkins University) ""SIPOs [Shelter-in-place-orders] were also ineffective, only reducing COVID-19 mortality by 2.9% on average,"" the trio wrote.\n\nThe analysis finds ""some evidence"" that closing bars reduced deaths. But ""no evidence that lockdowns, school closures, border closures, and limiting gatherings have had a noticeable effect on COVID-19 mortality.""\n\n""While this meta-analysis concludes that lockdowns have had little to no public health effects, they have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted,"" the authors advise. ""In consequence, lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.""\n\nWhile we\'re comfortable enough with pandemic-era terminology to know what\'s being discussed, it\'s worth knowing that the paper defines lockdowns as ""the imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). NPIs are any government mandate that directly restrict peoples\' possibilities, such as policies that limit internal movement, close schools and businesses, and ban international travel."" Shelter-in-place-orders are dictates generally confining people to their homes.\n\nThis paper won\'t be the last word on the effectiveness of public-health policies, given that they continue in many places, as do their effects. But it\'s also not the first word, since we\'ve been warned since the early days of COVID-19 that authoritarian efforts to control infection are counterproductive.\n\n""It\'s becoming clear that a lot of people have been exposed to the virus and that the death rate in people under 65 is not something you would lock down the economy for,"" Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford University, cautioned in June 2020. ""We can\'t just think about those who are vulnerable to the disease. We have to think about those who are vulnerable to lockdown too. The costs of lockdown are too high at this point.""\n\nGupta later co-authored the Great Barrington Declaration, which called for a less-restrictive approach to combating COVID-19.\n\n""Really important point by Professor Gupta,"" David Nabarro, special envoy on COVID-19 for the World Health Organization, commented in October 2020 with regard to the Oxford epidemiologist\'s economic concerns. ""We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus. The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted, but by and large, we\'d rather not do it.""\n\nIn the midst of concern over inflation, empty shelves, and labor shortages, the cost of public-health interventions into the economy should be obvious. Researchers find that mandatory lockdowns slammed business revenues in California and choked-off international trade. Flooding the economy with money to offset disruptions devalued currencies and caused prices to rise.\n\n""Overall federal debt rose nearly 30 percent,"" pointed out economist John H. Cochrane in a December 2021 paper. ""Is it at all a surprise that a year later inflation breaks out?""\n\nWe also paid a price in terms of liberty.\n\n""The withdrawal of civil liberties, attacks on freedom of expression and the failures of democratic accountability that occurred as a result of the pandemic are grave matters,"" The Economist\'s Democracy Index 2020 reported early in 2021.\n\n""The world is becoming more authoritarian as non-democratic regimes become even more brazen in their repression and many democratic governments suffer from backsliding by adopting their tactics of restricting free speech and weakening the rule of law, exacerbated by what threatens to become a \'new normal\' of Covid-19 restrictions,"" Sweden\'s International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance warned at the end of last year.\n\nFortunately, many places are now easing COVID-19 policies and admitting that we need to learn to live with the virus.\n\n""We are ready to step out of the shadow of the coronavirus. We say \'goodbye\' to restrictions and \'welcome\' to the life we knew before,"" Denmark\'s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said this week.\n\nBut residents of Boston, Washington, D.C., and other U.S. jurisdictions are still required by law to show proof of vaccination to enter many businesses. Amnesty International recently condemned Italy\'s draconian pandemic policies. And the World Health Organization continues to urge countries to abandon travel restrictions.\n\n""Lift or ease international traffic bans as they do not provide added value and continue to contribute to the economic and social stress experienced"" around the world, the organization urged in January.\n\nNow we have further evidence that enormous incursions into civil liberties and economic prosperity have done little to reduce deaths from COVID-19. We\'ve had an awful lot taken from us in return for very little, if any, gain.\n\n""Overall, we conclude that lockdowns are not an effective way of reducing mortality rates during a pandemic, at least not during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the Johns Hopkins paper\'s authors add. ""Our results are in line with the World Health Organization Writing Group (2006), who state, \'Reports from the 1918 influenza pandemic indicate that social-distancing measures did not stop or appear to dramatically reduce transmission.\'""\n\nThere\'s a lesson here, though it\'s not just about the ineffectiveness of the most intrusive efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic. It\'s a caution that any benefits the political class promises in return for disrupting our lives may be illusory. We\'ll have to fight to regain our liberty and prosperity, and we may never fully regain what we had.'}}",98.5,1

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60868795', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton over Russian collusion allegations - BBC', 'Snippet': 'Former US President Donald Trump has sued Hillary Clinton and several other Democrats, accusing them of trying to rig the 2016 US presidential election by linking his campaign to Russia.

Moscow denies any involvement.\n\nThe report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out instances where the president possibly obstructed justice.\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly claimed there was a Democratic conspiracy to undermine his presidency by suggesting his campaign had nefarious ties to Russia. Now he\'s putting his lawyers where his mouth is.\n\nThe lawsuit - against members of the Clinton campaign and senior FBI officials - is a decided longshot, in part because there is ample evidence of connections between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives as documented by Robert Mueller\'s special counsel investigation and a report by the bipartisan Senate intelligence committee.\n\nThe evidence includes the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior campaign staff and Russian nationals and contacts Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had with a suspected Russian intelligence operative. While that did not lead to charges of criminal collaboration between Mr Trump\'s team and Russia, it could undermine Mr Trump\'s allegations that the Clinton team invented the Trump campaign\'s Russia connections out of whole cloth.\n\nA court victory may be unlikely, but Mr Trump can tout the lawsuit itself to his supporters as evidence that he is fighting back against his accusers.

Other FBI officials described rookie mistakes that undercut the bureau’s brief inquiry into a possible Trump-Russia internet backchannel. At closing arguments during one of last year’s trials, Durham told jurors that “the FBI failed” on many occasions.\n\nRead more about the report.\n\nSpecial Counsel John Durham’s report details his investigation of a purported effort by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign to tie Donald Trump to Russia – and Durham concluded that it “did not, all things considered, amount to a provable criminal offense.”\n\nDurham reveals in a footnote that he interviewed Clinton in May 2022 as part of the probe. The investigation was looking into whether any crimes occurred in the handling of an uncorroborated piece of US intelligence indicating the Russians knew of a Clinton campaign plan to vilify her opponent, Trump, by tying him to Russia.\n\nThe 2016 intelligence got the attention of then CIA Director John Brennan, who briefed the Obama White House and referred the issue to the FBI.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe released some of Brennan’s notes about the intelligence used in his briefing of former President Barack Obama.\n\nRatcliffe publicly said that the intelligence community never corroborated the Russian claims of a Clinton Plan to frame Trump, and didn’t know whether it was fabricated.\n\nBut Durham believes the uncorroborated intelligence should have at least made the FBI question whether it was being used by a political opponent to pursue allegations against the Trump campaign, the report shows.\n\nIn her interview with Durham’s investigators, Clinton expressed sympathy for Durham’s hunt. She calls it, “really sad,” adding “I get it, you have to go down every rabbit hole.”\n\nShe called the intelligence that was consuming Durham’s time bogus, saying it “looked like Russian disinformation to me.”\n\nA spokesman for Clinton didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nDurham concludes that it would be impossible to prosecute anyone for their handling of the Clinton Plan intelligence. He said it “amounted to a significant intelligence failure,” but not a crime.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham concluded that the FBI should have never launched a full investigation into connections between Donald Trump’s campaign associates and Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nThe bureau does have a distinction between the types of investigations it can launch — and having a full probe allowed agents to use broader surveillance tools when looking into the Trump team Russia.\n\nHere’s the difference between a full FBI investigation — which Durham has criticized in the Trump-Russia probe — and a preliminary investigation.\n\nA preliminary investigation requires a lower threshold to open than a full investigation, and for that reason also means the agents can’t use more invasive tools like Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants and other court authorized surveillance.\n\nSpecifically, according to the FBI’s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide, during a preliminary investigation:\n\nAn agent must have “information or allegation” of a federal crime being committed or about to be committed.\n\nIt requires a relatively low threshold to open.\n\nThe investigation can only be open for six months without the agent running the case taking one of three actions: seeking a renewal, converting it to a Full investigation if authorized, or closing the case.\n\nCannot use intrusive tools like FISA and other electronic surveillance.\n\nA full investigation is more extensive and agents have access to more tools. During a full investigation:\n\nAn agent must have an “articulable factual basis” that a crime has or is about to occur in order to open the case. It’s a relatively high standard to open requiring more than merely an allegation of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nNo timeline for the investigation, but typically assessed by FBI supervisors annually to determine whether it should remain open.\n\nAll lawful tools, including intrusive surveillance allowed.\n\nBottom line, if the FBI had opened the investigation into the Trump-Russia probe as a preliminary vs. a full one, they would not have been permitted to use the host of FISA tools that ultimately became the subject of scrutiny by Durham, the Trump team, and DOJ’s inspector general. Opening the case as a preliminary investigation would have also limited the amount of information the FBI could collect as it sought to uncover potential ties between members of the Trump team and Russia.\n\nFormer Attorney General William Barr tapped special counsel John Durham in 2019 to review the origins of the Russia probe, and the scope of Durham’s work grew over the years.\n\nHe scrutinized the FBI’s handling of the Steele dossier, leaks of classified information about Trump-Russia contacts, and possible CIA misconduct regarding its analysis of Russian meddling, among other topics.\n\nLargely, his inquiry seemed to always zero in on former President Donald Trump’s political opponents and perceived enemies.\n\nWhen Durham began his probe, he was seen as an apolitical truth-seeker with a knack for investigating complex cases, including government scandals.\n\nBut that reputation waned over the years, especially after Durham took the unprecedented step of publicly rebuking the Justice Department inspector general after the watchdog released a report finding that the FBI’s decision to open the Trump-Russia probe was legally justified and untainted by bias.\n\nBoth Barr and Durham were publicly critical of the December 2019 inspector general report on the FBI’s Russia investigation.\n\nThat report contained blistering criticisms of FBI’s reliance on an unverified opposition research dossier on Trump and Russia and the FISA warrants that cited the dossier’s allegations, but Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote he did not find “documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the decisions” to open investigations that initially focused on four Trump campaign aides and advisers.\n\nFormer special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which inherited the initial Russia probe, released a detailed accounting of Russia’s effort to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nMueller found no evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but investigators documented numerous contacts between Trump associates and Russians.\n\nThe final Mueller report did not rely on the opposition research dossier.\n\nThe FBI has made reforms to the way it obtains warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in light of the inspector general’s report — which led to FBI invalidating two of the four warrants it obtained on the Trump campaign adviser – as well as a follow up investigation revealing widespread problems with FISA court applications.\n\nIn congressional testimony in 2020, FBI Director Chris Wray said that the FBI had implemented more than 40 changes aimed at making the FISA process more stringent in response to Horowitz’s report.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham scrutinized the FBI’s handling of the dossier, leaks of classified information about Trump-Russia contacts and possible CIA misconduct regarding its analysis of Russian meddling, among other topics during the course of his investigation.\n\nBut, he only pressed forward with two trials during his probe, both ending in acquittal.\n\nBefore the 2020 election, Barr elevated Durham to “special counsel” status, further protecting his position and making it politically difficult for the Biden-run Justice Department to control or shut down the investigation.\n\nDuring the trials, Trump and his allies continued to make bold predictions about what would be uncovered in the probe, particularly after Durham released vague allegations through court filings. Trump last year told Fox News that Durham was exposing the “crime of the century.”\n\nHis case against Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann ended with an acquittal in May. Durham charged Sussmann with lying to a top FBI official in September 2016 while passing along a tip about Trump’s ties to Russia. Sussmann’s lawyers accused Durham of bullying witnesses into changing their story and cherry-picking evidence to fuel claims of an anti-Trump conspiracy. After his acquittal, Sussmann said he was “falsely accused” by Durham.\n\nIn October, Durham personally oversaw his trial against Trump-Russia dossier source Igor Danchenko, who was charged with lying to the FBI about his sub-sourcing. Durham handled most of the arguments and witness questioning, but things quickly got off the rails.\n\nHe attacked his own witnesses when they helped the defense, and the judge threw out one of the five charges mid-trial. The Virginia jury reached “not guilty” verdicts on all remaining counts.\n\nJohn Durham, the special counsel who led the investigation into potential misconduct in the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe, has made a career of investigating high-profile public corruption.\n\nIn a 300-plus page report, the Trump administration appointee determined that the FBI should never have launched its investigation into connections between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, according to the report compiled over three years and released on Monday.\n\nDurham, 73, was appointed to serve as special counsel in October 2020 by then-Attorney General William Barr. He previously was the Justice Department’s top prosecutor in Connecticut — a position he was appointed to in 2017 and left in 2021.\n\nDurham became a lawyer in 1975. He is known for having handled high-profile, sensitive investigations in both Democratic and Republican administrations during his decadeslong career with the Justice Department.\n\nHe was appointed by then-Attorney General Janet Reno in 1999 to investigate corruption surrounding the use of FBI informants in Boston, and later by then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey to investigate the CIA’s destruction of videotapes of detainee interrogations in 2008. Durham closed the latter probe without bringing any charges.\n\nIn addition to his work as a special prosecutor, Durham has extensive experience as a trial lawyer. He went after gangs in New Haven, prosecuted mob figures, and secured a guilty plea from former Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, a Republican who admitted to corruption.\n\nThough the new special counsel report levies criticism after criticism of how the FBI handled the Trump-Russia probe, John Durham is not recommending “any wholesale changes” to the agency’s — or Justice Department — guidelines or policies.\n\nThe report, Durham writes, is meant to capture the findings of the special counsel investigation and to “assist the Attorney General in determining how the Department and the FBI can do a better, more credible job.”\n\nDurham however did float a proposal to create a career position for a nonpartisan FBI lawyer or agent who would be tasked with challenging steps taken in “politically sensitive investigations,” including surveillance warrant applications.\n\nDurham said he was not proposing any changes to FBI policies in a conclusion to the report’s executive summary, where he claimed that the FBI “failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to the law.”\n\nThe report asserts that “the answer is not the creation of new rules but a renewed fidelity to the old.”\n\nHis report says there is a need for the FBI to recognize that there was a “lack of analytical rigor, apparent confirmation bias, and an over-willingness to rely on information from individuals connected to political opponents.”\n\nThe FBI agents who worked on the surveillance applications for the Trump campaign aide Carter Page, Durham claims, showed “cavalier attitude towards accuracy and completeness,” as they allegedly disregarded requirements for renewing the warrants.\n\nFBI personnel, Durham writes, displayed a “serious lack of analytical rigor towards the information that they received, especially information received from politically affiliated persons and entities,” and that information contributed to both the launch the FBI’s initial probe and the opening of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.\n\n“The Department did not adequately examine or question these materials and the motivations of those providing them, even when at about the same time the Director of the FBI and others learned of significant and potentially contrary intelligence,” Durham writes.\n\nEven if hindsight is clearer, the report says, “much of this also seems to have been clear at the time.”\n\nUsing harsh language, special counsel John Durham claims in his report that the FBI deviated from his previous approach to foreign election interference matters in how it opened, with the Trump appointed-prosecutor touting how the FBI treated matters related to former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic White House nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nDurham zeroed in on former FBI Deputy Director Andre McCabe and Peter Strzok, the ex-deputy director of the counter-intelligence division,\n\n“Strzok, at a minimum, had pronounced hostile feelings toward Trump,” Durham wrote, while quoting in a footnote previously known texts between Strzok and Lisa Page, then an FBI attorney.\n\nDurham knocked the FBI for failing to take several steps before launching the Trump campaign investigations, such as interviewing relevant witnesses, reviewing its own intelligence databases, for or using “any of the standard analytical tools typically employed by the FBI in evaluating raw intelligence.”\n\nDurham suggested that if the FBI had taken those steps, it would have found that US intelligence agencies did not have any evidence tying Trump to Russian leadership officials.\n\nThe report cites for comparison examples of how the FBI approached investigations concerning Hillary Clinton. Durham points to specifically to “highly significant intelligence” the FBI “received from a trusted foreign source pointing to a Clinton campaign plan to vilify Trump by tying him to Vladimir Putin so as to divert attention from her own concerns relating to her use of a private email server.”\n\n“Unlike the FBI’s opening of a full investigation of unknown members of the Trump campaign based on raw, uncorroborated information, in this separate matter involving a purported Clinton campaign plan, the FBI never opened any type of inquiry, issued any taskings, employed any analytical personnel, or produced any analytical products in connection with the information,” the report said.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham’s report is critical of the Steele dossier, an explosive document that had been used by the FBI to bolster its case for probable cause to secure surveillance warrants against a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\n“As noted, it was not until mid-September that the Crossfire Hurricane investigators received several of the Steele Reports. Within days of their receipt, the unvetted and unverified Steele Reports were used to support probable cause in the FBI’s FISA applications targeting (Carter) Page, a U.S. citizen who, for a period of time, had been an advisor to Trump,” the report says.\n\n“As discussed later in the report, this was done at a time when the FBI knew that the same information Steele had provided to the FBI had also been fed to the media and others in Washington, D.C.,” it added.\n\nThe Steele dossier contained unverified allegations about Trump’s connections to Russia, including his alleged business dealings, rumors of lurid trysts in Moscow and claims that his campaign collaborated with the Kremlin in 2016.\n\nTrump vehemently denied the claims, and Steele’s work has lost a significant amount of credibility over the years. Today, the dossier is largely seen as an unproven collection of rumors and gossip.\n\n“As noted, the FBI attempted, over time, to investigate and analyze the Steele Reports but ultimately was not able to confirm or corroborate any of the substantive allegations contained in those reports. In the context of these efforts, and as discussed in (the report), the FBI learned that Steele relied primarily on a U.S.-based Russian national, Igor Danchenko, to collect information that ultimately formed the core allegations found in the reports,” the report reads.\n\n“Specifically, our investigation discovered that Danchenko himself had told another person that he (Danchenko) was responsible for 80% of the intel” and 50% of the analysis contained in the Steele Dossier,” it adds.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham concluded that the FBI should never have launched its full investigation into connections between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, according to a report compiled over three years by the Trump-administration appointee and released on Monday.\n\nDurham’s 300-plus page report also states that the FBI used “raw, unanalyzed, and uncorroborated intelligence,” to launch the “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation into Trump and Russia but used a different standard when weighing concerns about alleged election interference regarding Hillary Clinton’s campaign.\n\nThe special counsel, however, did not recommend any new charges against individuals or “wholesale changes” about how the FBI handles politically charged investigations, despite strongly criticizing the agency’s behavior.\n\nThe report also concludes that “at least on the part of certain personnel intimately involved in the matter” there was “a predisposition to open an investigation into Trump.”\n\nDurham’s findings that the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign should not have happened are at odds with a previous Justice Department inspector general investigation into the FBI’s Russia probe, which identified problems with the investigation but concluded in December 2019 there was sufficient justification to open the inquiry.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland sent Durham’s report to congressional lawmakers and released the report on Monday.\n\nIn a letter to Congress accompanying the report, Garland said, “Special Counsel Durham’s unclassified report is attached in full as submitted to me, without any additions, redactions, or other modifications.”\n\nDurham’s conclusions condemning the FBI’s investigation into Trump is sure to fuel the debate about Russia, Trump, the FBI and the 2016 presidential election that is still swirling more than six years after and as Trump is campaigning once again for the White House.\n\nThe investigation was launched in May 2019 by Trump’s former Attorney General William Barr — a probe that Trump and his right-wing allies repeatedly predicted would “investigate the investigators” and lead to bombshell indictments of those who scrutinized the former president. Four years later, Durham’s investigation yielded one minor conviction, two losses at trial and a probe that fell short of the lofty goals set by the former president.\n\nDurham only secured one conviction: the guilty plea of a low-level FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, who avoided jail after admitting to doctoring an email about a surveillance warrant. Durham’s other two prosecutions — against a Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer and the primary source for the Trump-Russia dossier — ended with embarrassing acquittals.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham has released a report on his office’s investigation into wrongdoing in the Trump-Russia probe.\n\nThe FBI opened the initial Russia investigation, codenamed “Crossfire Hurricane,” in late July 2016. Special counsel Robert Mueller inherited that investigation in May 2017, and he wrapped up his work in March 2019. In all, that means the Justice Department spent about two years and eight months investigating the connections between Trump’s campaign and the Russian government.\n\nAs Mueller wrapped up his work in the spring of 2019, then-Attorney General Bill Barr tapped Durham to “investigate the investigators” and review the origins of the FBI’s Russia probe\n\nBarr upgraded Durham to “special counsel” status shortly before the 2020 election, making it politically harder for the incoming Biden-run Justice Department to shut down Durham’s team if they wanted to. Garland has let Durham continue, despite complaints from liberal commentators and Durham’s targets that he is twisting the law in furtherance of a Trump-friendly political agenda.\n\nProsecutions: In all, Durham has prosecuted just three people: Igor Danchenko, a Russian analyst who was a source for the 2016 dossier of allegations about Trump, the acquitted Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann and a low-level FBI lawyer named Kevin Clinesmith.\n\nThere are reports that Durham’s team also looked into a wide range of other matters that former President Donald Trump has publicly complained about – without bringing any charges. This includes potential wrongdoing by the CIA and other parts of the US intelligence community, on topics related to Russia’s pro-Trump interference in the 2016 election.\n\nDurham’s team has spent nearly $4.5 million since October 2020, according to financial data released by the Justice Department. The cost of Durham’s first year and half of work, when he was a US attorney and not a special counsel, has not been disclosed.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/09/trump-lawsuit-against-hillary-clinton-dnc-over-russia-claims-dismissed.html', 'Headline': 'Trump lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, DNC over Russia claims dismissed', 'Snippet': 'Trump sued Clinton, the DNC, John Podesta, Fusion GPS and others over claims of a conspiracy to sow false Trump-Russia collusion to undermine his 2016 campaign.', 'Full_text': 'A federal judge dismissed former President Donald Trump\'s sprawling lawsuit alleging Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and many others conspired to spread a false narrative of collusion between Trump\'s campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn a searing order Thursday, Judge Donald Middlebrooks said that Trump\'s lawsuit was merely ""seeking to flaunt a two-hundred-page political manifesto outlining his grievances against those that have opposed him.""\n\nThe former president\'s claims ""are not only unsupported by any legal authority but plainly foreclosed by binding precedent,"" Middlebrooks wrote in U.S. District Court in southern Florida.\n\nTrump filed the lawsuit in March, seeking tens of millions of dollars in damages for violations of the RICO Act, a federal law that aims to combat organized crime, among other claims.

Trump SubmittedMarch 30, 2023StartedApril 15, 2024DecidedMay 30, 2024VerdictGuilty on all counts[1]ChargeFirst-degree falsifying business records (34 counts)CitationIND-71543-23[2]Court membershipJudge sittingJuan Merchan\n\nThe People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump is a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States and current president-elect. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels as hush money to buy her silence over a sexual encounter between them; with costs related to the transaction included, the payments totaled $420,000. The Manhattan District Attorney (DA), Alvin Bragg, accused Trump of falsifying these business records with the intent to commit other crimes: violation of federal campaign finance limits, unlawfully influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and tax fraud.[a]\n\nThe indictment, the first of a former U.S. president, was approved by a Manhattan grand jury on March 30, 2023. On April 3, Trump traveled from his residence in Florida to New York City, where he surrendered to the Manhattan DA\'s office and was arraigned the next day. Trump pleaded not guilty and stated that he would continue to campaign for the 2024 presidential election, even if convicted. The trial began on April 15, 2024. On April 30, Trump also became the first U.S. president to be held in criminal contempt of court, due to comments he made earlier in the month about individuals involved with the trial.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Trump\'s 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the payment of hush money to Daniels through Trump\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who was reimbursed via a false retainer agreement. The prosecution rested on May 20, 2024, after calling 20 witnesses. The defense argued that Trump was unaware of any allegedly unlawful scheme, that Cohen was unreliable as a witness, and that the retainer agreement between them was valid. The defense rested on May 21 after calling two witnesses. Throughout proceedings, the defense also made unsuccessful requests for the case to be delayed or dismissed, for the judge to recuse himself, and for a mistrial.\n\nTrump was convicted on all counts on May 30, 2024, becoming the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Sentencing is scheduled for November 26. Trump has said that he will appeal the ruling.\n\nBackground\n\nStormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn July 2006, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known professionally as ""Stormy Daniels"", met Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. At the time, Trump was the host of the reality TV series The Apprentice and was married to Melania Trump.[4] According to Daniels, Trump invited her to his penthouse at Harrah\'s Lake Tahoe[5] where the two had sex and talked about making her a guest on The Apprentice.[6][7]\n\nIn 2011, Daniels considered selling the story to the celebrity magazine Life & Style for US$15,000 as Trump began exploring a potential presidential bid. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened to sue Life & Style when it asked the Trump Organization for comment. Daniels\' agent, Gina Rodriguez, leaked the story to the gossip blog The Dirty in October. The post was taken down following complaints by Trump\'s lawyers, and Daniels disputed the story\'s veracity.[8] Cohen acknowledged during court testimony in May 2024 that he advised for the story\'s removal.[9]\n\nAs Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign began, Rodriguez approached multiple publications—including the National Enquirer—and attempted to sell the story. Following the publication of a controversial recording of Trump and Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, the National Enquirer sought to suppress the story. Rather than paying Daniels, the National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard negotiated a $130,000 non-disclosure agreement between Daniels and Michael Cohen. Cohen attempted to find the money as the election neared and repeatedly delayed her payment. Keith Davidson, Daniels\' lawyer, canceled the deal in October 2016.[5][8]\n\nUltimately, Cohen drew the money from his home equity line of credit and sent it through a shell company incorporated in Delaware.[5][8] Trump initially denied knowing about the check made out to Daniels. In April 2018, aboard Air Force One, he told a reporter he did not know where Cohen got the money.[10] Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post described this statement as a lie,[11] as Trump had personally reimbursed Cohen for the payment.[12][11][13] Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, also refuted Trump\'s claims in a Fox News interview, saying that Trump was aware of the payments.[14]\n\nTrump wrote several checks totaling $420,000 to Cohen. The checks reimbursed him for the non-disclosure agreement and covered the costs for Cohen to manipulate online polls to boost Trump\'s status. The $180,000 paid to Cohen was doubled to offset taxes, and $60,000 was added. These payments were made throughout 2017, during Trump\'s first year of presidency.[15] The payments made to Cohen were declared as a legal expense.[16] Nine monthly checks from Trump to Cohen, dated April to December 2017, exist as evidence.[17]\n\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported on Cohen\'s payment to Daniels.[18] Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts relating to the payment—as well as another payment made to Karen McDougal—in August. In his admission of guilt, Cohen stated that he acted ""at the direction of a candidate for federal office"", implicating Trump.[19][20] In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison.[21]\n\nOn May 2, 2024, The Daily Beast broke a story that Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg had assisted the 2016 campaign with its finance reports.[22]\n\nManhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nFollowing Cohen\'s August 2018 admission of guilt, Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance Jr. opened an investigation against the Trump Organization and two of its executives.[23] The office paused its inquiry when the office of the federal U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York began a separate investigation into the payments,[24] but the federal inquiry concluded without charges in July 2019.[25][b]\n\nThe Manhattan DA\'s office then issued a subpoena for the Trump Organization in August, seeking documents relating to the payments.[27] Additionally, the office subpoenaed accounting firm Mazars USA, demanding eight years of Trump\'s corporate tax returns.[28] Trump\'s lawyers sued Vance to block the subpoena, citing Trump\'s immunity from criminal inquiries as the president of the United States.[29] In Trump v. Vance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7–2 in favor of Vance, allowing the subpoena to continue.[30]\n\nFollowing the 2021 New York County District Attorney election, Alvin Bragg succeeded Vance as the Manhattan DA.[31] In early 2021, Mark Pomerantz, a Manhattan prosecutor, sought to revive the case under the theory that if Daniels had extorted Trump, the money would be criminal proceeds, and efforts to conceal its source would constitute money laundering.[32] On further examination, Pomerantz found that the money laundering statute would not apply, and colleagues were skeptical that the hush money would qualify as extortion.[32] With no path to felony charges, Pomerantz abandoned the inquiry and subsequently resigned in February 2022.[32] In January 2023, the Manhattan DA\'s office impaneled a grand jury, and began presenting evidence of Trump\'s role in the Stormy Daniels payment.[33] Cohen met extensively with the DA\'s office and the grand jury,[34][35][36] and by March 3, Cohen had met with the DA\'s office 18 times[37][38][39] and had given his cellphones to the DA\'s prosecutors, who wanted evidence of communications including voice recordings of Daniels\' former lawyer Keith Davidson.[40] Several other witnesses met with the DA\'s office or the grand jury in March 2023, including Kellyanne Conway,[41] Hope Hicks, two Trump Organization employees, two former National Enquirer executives who helped broker the hush-money deal, a lawyer for Daniels,[42][43] Daniels herself,[44] Trump-aligned lawyer Robert Costello (who provided testimony, including emails, in which he attempted to discredit Cohen\'s reliability),[45][46] and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.[47][48][c] As early as that February, prosecutors confirmed that they might leverage additional charges, including insurance fraud, against Allen Weisselberg to pressure him to testify against Trump,[51] and in May, The New York Times reported that they were considering perjury charges against him.[52]\n\nIn March 2023, District Attorney Alvin Bragg\'s office indicated that an indictment was likely.[53] By March 9, 2023, prosecutors had offered Trump a chance to testify before the grand jury the following week, indicating that they were likely preparing to indict him.[54][55] Around that time, Trump and his spokesperson began referring to both Daniels\' allegation and the DA\'s proceedings as ""extortion"".[56] On March 10, 2023, Trump\'s lawyer Joe Tacopina asked New York City\'s Department of Investigation to review the criminal probe, asserting its ""weaponization"".[57] On March 13, Tacopina announced that Trump would not testify.[58] Early the next morning, The Guardian reported that Trump\'s lawyers had argued to the DA that Trump should not be indicted on the basis that the payment did not draw from campaign funds and would have been made regardless of his candidacy.[59]\n\nIn late March 2023, there was reporting around Daniels having reportedly unsuccessfully communicated in 2018 with Tacopina about possibly representing her in the scandal, for which the DA could move to disqualify the lawyer due to attorney–client privilege and because she reputedly disclosed confidential information to his firm.[60][61][62][63] Additionally, it reemerged that, in 2018, Tacopina had called the hush-money payment ""an illegal agreement"", ""a fraud"", and ""a potential campaign finance issue"".[60]\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Trump claimed on his social-media platform, Truth Social, that he was to be arrested on March 21[d][e] and that the proceedings were disinformation backed by President Joe Biden, calling for protests in anticipation of a possible indictment.[66][67][68][69][70] Law enforcement and security agencies prepared for potential reactions to an indictment of Trump that week, especially in the areas of the Manhattan Criminal Court and Trump Tower, including by monitoring online threats.[69][71][72][f] New York City Police began to increase security in preparation for the expected indictment on March 21, and a second time for the second expected indictment on March 30.[74] Metal barriers were set up around Trump Tower and the district Criminal Court Building.[75] On March 24, Trump, citing his presidential prospects, insinuated that ""potential death & destruction"" could result from Bragg\'s allegedly false charge.[76][g]\n\nTrump has called the investigation a ""witch hunt"", claiming political persecution.[81] Trump proponents have referred to the case as harassment, calling it a ""political hack job"".[82] The trial and accompanying political theatrics have been described as a ""circus"" by the media.[83][84][85] Due to multiple investigation revivals, the case earned the moniker of ""zombie case"".[32][86]\n\nEligibility for president\n\nThe Article II of the U.S. Constitution does not have any rules blocking presidential candidates with criminal records.[87] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier in Trump v. Anderson that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking the prohibition in section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which states ""no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US"".[88]\n\nInitial proceedings\n\nIndictment and charges\n\nThe Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on March 30, 2023.[89] The indictment was filed with the New York Supreme Court (the ordinary trial court for felonies in the state of New York and not the final court of appeal for the state) the same day.[90] The charges were under seal until published when Trump was arraigned.[91][92]\n\nThe indictment charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law §175.10.[93][94] Each count is related to a specific business document, each having a date ranging from February 14 through December 5, 2017:[95]\n\n11 for invoices from Michael Cohen\n\n9 for general ledger entries for Donald J. Trump\n\n9 for checks from Donald J. Trump\n\n3 for general ledger entries for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\n2 for checks from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\nThe allegedly falsified documents are related to Trump\'s payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money. The payments were listed in the business records as a legal expense payable to Michael Cohen, whereas the indictment alleges that they were actually to reimburse Cohen for the earlier, allegedly illicit, payment to Daniels.[96][97]\n\nFalsifying business records in the first degree is a felony under New York state law that requires that the ""intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof"". This is in contrast to falsifying business records in the second degree, which is a misdemeanor that does not have that requirement.[95][96][97] The charges neither include, nor even identify, the additional crimes, constituting a relatively unusual strategy for the DA:[98][95]\n\nA New York Times analysis of about 30 false business records cases brought by Mr. Bragg and his predecessor — based on court records, interviews and information the office provided — shows that in this respect, the case against Mr. Trump stands apart. In all but two of the indictments reviewed by The Times, the defendant was charged with an additional crime on top of the false records charge.\n\nIn later filings, Bragg listed (but still did not charge) three general types of crime that Trump allegedly intended to commit: violation of federal campaign finance limits, violation of state election laws by unlawfully influencing the 2016 election, and violation of state tax laws regarding the reimbursement.[99] Trump could have moved to allow the jury to convict on the misdemeanor charges as a lesser included offense, but he did not.[100][101]\n\nEach count for which Trump was convicted could result in a prison sentence of up to four years, to be served consecutively, with a maximum sentence of 20 years.[102][95][103][104] He is permitted to assume the presidency even should he be in prison.[105] The judge may also choose to impose no prison sentence.[106]\n\nThe conviction did not legally prohibit Trump from continuing his campaign in the 2024 presidential election, which he won.[105] (Trump had stated in an April 2023 Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson that he would continue his candidacy even if convicted.)[107][108]\n\nArraignment\n\nTrump was arraigned on April 4, 2023. A law enforcement source told Reuters that police would close streets around the courthouse in advance of Trump\'s expected appearance.[109] On April 3, Trump flew from Palm Beach International Airport into LaGuardia Airport on his private plane, and took his motorcade to Trump Tower, where he stayed the night.[110][111] Todd Blanche, a lawyer who had defended Paul Manafort during his 2016 fraud trial, had recently resigned from his law firm to aid Trump\'s case.[112] Police increased security in and around Manhattan ahead of the arraignment; authorities said there were no credible threats of violence or organized plans of protests.[111] Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, warned protestors to be peaceful.[113] Acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is presiding over the case.[114] Merchan denied a motion filed by media organizations to allow a television broadcast of the arraignment or to allow electronic devices to be used in the courtroom, but allowed five press pool still photographers.[115][116] Courtroom sketch artists also documented the proceedings.[117] The courtroom\'s glass doors were covered as a security measure.[118]\n\nUpon entering the courthouse, he was put in police custody and placed under arrest.[119][120] He was booked and fingerprinted, but he was not handcuffed, nor was a mug shot taken.[121][122] Trump entered the courtroom an hour later,[123] pleading not guilty to 34 felony charges.[124] The indictment was unsealed (publicly released) shortly thereafter, charging Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree as part of a ""conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election"".[125][126] This marked the first indictment of a former U.S. president.[127][128][129] At the arraignment, Merchan warned Trump not to use social media to incite violence.[130]\n\nPossible trial dates were discussed; prosecutors proposed January 2024, but Trump\'s defense team objected, saying that the trial should be set for later in 2024.[131]\n\nImmediately after the arraignment, Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago and addressed a crowd of supporters in the evening.[132][110] Trump made several false claims about topics such as his handling of government documents, District Attorney Bragg, and the Trump–Raffensperger phone call.[133]\n\nPre-trial proceedings\n\nDuring Trump\'s arraignment, the court set deadlines for pre-trial proceedings, including for prosecutors to provide discovery to the defense.[131] The court set a deadline of August 8, 2023, for pre-trial motions to be filed.[131]\n\nAs he had done in other cases, Trump used ""attack-and-delay"" tactics, targeting the prosecutors and the judge while prolonging proceedings, with the aim that the case might continue into late 2024, near the presidential election.[134][135]\n\nTrump\'s lawyers maintained that he was unaware of any allegedly unlawful schemes that his allies or associates may have engaged in.[136] On March 12, 2024, the defense team filed their strategy writing ""President Trump lacked the requisite intent to commit the conduct charged in the Indictment because of his awareness that various lawyers were involved in the underlying conduct giving rise to the charges.""[137] The defense counsel stated that they would not invoke the formal ""advice of counsel"" defense, but that Trump would ""elicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges"".[137][138][h]\n\nRequest for indictment dismissal\n\nOn September 29, 2023, Trump\'s team submitted omnibus motions to dismiss the indictment and requesting clarification of the charges.[140]\n\nOn April 27, Trump\'s team had asked for the charges to be explained in full.[141] It was possible that the second crime(s) would eventually be specified in a bill of particulars,[142] but according to a governing appeals case from c. 1980 this is not necessary.[143] On May 16, the DA\'s office argued that it did not need to elaborate further on the basis that Trump already ""has more than sufficient information to prepare his defense"", while reiterating possible secondary charges.[144][145][i] Trump\'s team was reportedly considering invoking a 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision which emphasizes the importance of specifying punishable criminal charges; additionally, a 1999 decision states that ""any fact ... that increases the maximum penalty for [one] crime must be charged in an indictment ... and proved"".[141]\n\nOn February 15, 2024, the court denied the motions to dismiss.[146][147][148] However, the court did partially grant Trump\'s request seeking clarification of the charges. Trump is not only accused of falsifying business records, but doing so with the intention to commit or conceal some other crime. Holding it would be unfair to expect Trump to prepare a defense to a newly raised theory mid-trial, the court limited the prosecution to just three theories of ""other crimes"" that had already been identified during pre-trial procedure.[146][149]\n\nDiscovery materials and witnesses\n\nAs of Trump\'s arraignment on April 4, 2023, it was expected that the discovery process would take several months.[150]\n\nOn April 17, 2023, the DA\'s office requested that Merchan obtain further information from Tacopina, including his firm\'s correspondence with Daniels, to determine whether their history constituted a conflict of interest.[63] On September 1, Merchan ruled that it did not.[151]\n\nOn May 4, Merchan heard arguments about the DA office\'s request to restrict information it turns over to Trump\'s lawyers from being shared with Trump himself (at least until the trial), citing his past social-media posts attacking Bragg and witnesses. The defense has argued that the government should be equally restrained from discussing information publicly and that Trump should be allowed to defend himself politically.[152][153] On May 8, Merchan ruled in favor of the order, barring evidence from being shared on social media.[154] The judge instructed Trump and his lawyers on their conduct on May 23, informing them that violations could incur a ""wide range of sanctions"" including being held in contempt of court.[155]\n\nOn May 26, prosecutors stated that they had informed Trump\'s lawyers that evidence in the hush-money case includes various audio recordings, including one of Trump and a witness. It was unclear if this was in reference to secretly recorded audio from September 2016 which Cohen had previously released.[156][157][158][159]\n\nOn August 3, federal judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversaw E. Jean Carroll\'s civil lawsuits against Trump alleging sexual assault and defamation,[j] ruled that Carroll\'s lawyers could provide video of Trump being deposed to Manhattan prosecutors.[162]\n\nOn January 15, 2024, Tacopina withdrew from Trump\'s counsel[163] and Daniels said she expected to testify.[164] Later in the month, the DA was reportedly beginning to meet with witnesses ahead of the trial.[165]\n\nOn March 18, the judge ruled that both Daniels and Cohen could testify, placing some restrictions on Daniels (as well as Karen McDougal). The defense had requested that the two be blocked from testifying the previous month. Additionally, the judge ruled that Trump\'s Access Hollywood tape could not be played during the trial but that it could be discussed.[166]\n\nOn April 22, Merchan ruled on what prosecutors may ask Trump if he testified,[167] following a pretrial Sandoval hearing held on April 19.[168][169][170]\n\nOn May 10, Judge Juan Merchan suggested that Allen Weisselberg could be called to testify in court after the defense objected to the prosecution\'s plan to show the jury a $750,000 severance agreement.[171] Neither the defense nor the prosecution had subpoenaed Weisselberg, and there were procedural concerns about adding him to the witness list so late in the trial.[171] Furthermore, Weisselberg\'s testimony could be in violation of the non-disparagement clause of his severance agreement and he would likely invoke the fifth amendment.[172][173]\n\nRequests for recusal\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, who has experience with financial cases,[174] was randomly assigned to oversee the grand jury proceedings in Trump\'s case, and continued to oversee handling of the charges approved by the grand jury.[175]\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers filed a motion asking Judge Merchan to recuse himself from the case citing his daughter\'s position as partner and COO of Authentic Campaigns, a consulting firm that serviced Biden\'s 2020 presidential campaign. The motion additionally alleged that Merchan had encouraged former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg to cooperate with the prosecution against Trump in a previous case he had presided over, and that Merchan had made three $10–15 donations to various Democratic causes.[176][177][k] On June 20, the DA\'s office argued against the recusal request, citing Trump\'s alleged ""prolific history of baselessly accusing state and federal judges around the country of bias"", saying he seemed to be trying to land a more favorable judge. Prosecutors further argued that there was a lack of hard evidence that a particular trial result would aid Merchan directly or greatly via his daughter\'s Democratic work,[180] which a state ethics panel had similarly concluded in early May.[181][l] The court denied the motion on August 11, 2023.[185]\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the defense asked Merchan for permission to file a motion repeating their prior request that he recuse himself for what the defense said was a conflict of interest due to his daughter\'s Democratic involvement.[186] On April 1, the New York City Bar Association issued a statement of ""unequivocal support"" for Merchan\'s handling of the recusal concerns.[m] On April 2, prosecutors pointed out that the court and an ethics panel had already found that the political activities of a relative are not grounds for questioning a judge\'s impartiality.[188][n]\n\nThe same day, Trump posted a Fox & Friends clip in which co-host Brian Kilmeade criticized the judge\'s daughter, although Trump highlighted another commentator\'s statement.[191] As of April 3, Trump had not deleted offending posts made prior to Merchan\'s expanded order;[192] that night, he linked to a report by far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Merchan\'s daughter and wife.[193] On April 5, Trump\'s campaign publicized their motion for Merchan to recuse himself (dated April 3),[188] which asserts numerous counts of bias, and falsely cites the state Office of Court Administration (OCA) as saying Merchan\'s daughter deleted her X account in April 2023, around when the judge ""solicited an ethics opinion regarding recusal in a letter ... that the Court declined to disclose"".[194][181][195][o][p]\n\nOn April 6, Trump posted online that if arrested for violating the gag order, he would consider it a ""great honor"" to ""become a Modern Day Nelson Mandela"", the former South African president jailed for anti-apartheid activism.[201] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked an appeals court to delay the trial and pause the gag order while they appeal the latter; this was denied the following day.[202][203] On April 10, an appeals judge denied another defense delay request which was based on Merchan having not yet ruled on the recusal motion.[204][202] On April 15, Merchan denied the recusal motion.[205] On April 30, an appellate court denied requests for both a recusal and a stay of proceedings.[206]\n\nRequest for removal to federal court\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers asked for the case to be moved to a federal court (though it would remain a state-law prosecution conducted by the Manhattan DA), arguing that it involved alleged conduct somehow ""performed while in office""—despite the potential federal election-law violations not being specified and occurring prior to Trump\'s inauguration.[153][145][q] As proceedings continued in the New York Supreme Court,[207] Bragg asked for the removal request to be dismissed, arguing that Trump had failed to establish that he was an officer of the United States during his presidency,[208][209] to which the defense expounded its initial argument.[210][153] Even if the case had been moved to federal court, New York state law would have continued to apply.[211]\n\nIn a hearing on June 27, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein opined that Trump\'s conduct likely did not constitute presidential activity.[212] On July 19, arguing that the matter was apparently a personal ""cover-up of an embarrassing event"", Hellerstein ruled that the case should remain in state court.[213] Trump appealed the decision on July 28,[214] but withdrew this on November 14.[215]\n\nTrial scheduling\n\nOn May 23, 2023, Justice Merchan set the trial for March 25, 2024.[216] Trump\'s team complained that he expected to have multiple trials around that time. Merchan said he would discuss rescheduling to another time.[217] At a February 15, 2024, hearing, which Trump attended,[218] Merchan reaffirmed the March 25 trial date.[219]\n\nIn early February 2024, Trump\'s federal election obstruction trial, originally set for early March, was postponed pending appeals, increasing the likelihood of the Manhattan criminal trial taking place as planned on March 25, 2024.[220][221]\n\nOn March 11, 2024, Trump\'s lawyers requested a delay of trial until after the federal election obstruction case on the basis that it would bolster his argument of presidential immunity, as some evidence and allegedly some acts overlapped with his time in office.[222] Trump\'s team cited, from April 2018, Trump\'s denying knowledge of the hush-money payment to reporters and tweeting in defense of Cohen\'s credibility.[223] Later on March 11, Merchan pointed out that Trump\'s team had missed the filing deadline and said either party would need his permission to file additional pretrial motions.[222] On March 3, the judge dismissed the request as untimely.[224]\n\nAlso on March 11, Trump asked to delay trial until after the Supreme Court decides whether he is generally immune from prosecution in the federal charges on election obstruction. Granting the motion would have delayed trial until mid-summer or later, as the Supreme Court had already scheduled those arguments for April 25[225] and may not rule until the end of the court\'s term in early July.[226] Merchan denied the motion on April 3,[227] saying that he doubted its ""sincerity and actual purpose"", given that Trump made this request only two weeks before trial.[228]\n\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office provided prosecutors with approximately 170,000 pages of documents, largely related to the 2017 federal probe of Cohen\'s payment to Daniels (and mostly reflecting evidence already turned over to Trump\'s lawyers in June 2023).[229][230][231] Trump\'s lawyers sought a delay in the trial on the basis of the newly produced records; the DA\'s office said in court that only 300 of the documents were relevant to Trump\'s defense.[232] On March 15, 2024, the judge delayed the start of trial until mid-April.[233] On March 25, 2024, the judge set a trial date of April 15, and denied a motion by Trump\'s team to further delay the trial.[232] On May 23, 2024, Merchan denied Trump\'s request to sanction prosecutors regarding the document release, ruling that the defense was provided sufficient time to respond.[234]\n\nOn March 18, Trump\'s team requested an additional delay on the basis that pretrial publicity and apparent anti-Trump bias in Manhattan would prohibit a fair jury from being selected in April, although only 35% in the cited poll said they were convinced Trump was guilty in the DA\'s case specifically. Trump\'s lawyers cited berating statements by Cohen, e.g. saying he served jail time because his ""lying"" former boss ""couldn\'t keep his mushroom dick in his pants"". On March 25, the assistant DA countered that ""publicity is not likely to abate [and] the pretrial publicity has been ... exacerbated by the defendant"".[235] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked the appeals court for a delay to allow an attempt to move the trial to a different county, which was denied the same day.[202]\n\nOn April 8, Trump requested to postpone the trial so the court could consider a change of venue, which was denied the same day,[236] and so he could appeal the gag order, which was denied the next day.[237] On April 10, the appeals court denied Trump\'s request to postpone trial on the basis of Merchan being unqualified.[238] On April 12, Merchan denied the defendant\'s request to delay trial on the basis of ""prejudicial"" media coverage.[239] On April 15, Merchan said Trump was ""required to be here"" on April 25 and ""not required to be at the Supreme Court"" that day, when it would hear arguments on his immunity claim in the federal election case.[240] Merchan said he was not yet prepared to say whether trial would be held on May 17 to allow Trump to attend his son Barron\'s high-school graduation, but indicated that he probably would grant him the day off if the proceedings progressed at an expected pace.[241] Trump subsequently complained that he would ""not be allowed"" to attend the graduation, but on April 30 the judge said he would be able to do so.[242] On May 17, Donald and Melania Trump attended their son\'s graduation from Oxbridge Academy at West Palm Beach, followed by a visit to Lincoln Reagan Dinner at the 2024 annual Minnesota Republican convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[243]\n\nGag order\n\nIn a May 2023 hearing and court filing, prosecutors expressed concern that Trump would misuse evidence obtained through pretrial discovery procedure to attack people involved in the case, including witnesses.[211] Justice Merchan declined to issue a gag order or prohibit Trump from publicly commenting about the case against him,[211] but issued a protective order setting rules for the use of social media involving elements of the case, and set a hearing (with Trump to appear remotely) to explain the rules.[244][245]\n\nAt Trump\'s arraignment, on April 4, 2023, Merchan instructed Blanche to ""speak to your client and anybody else you need to, and remind them to please refrain, please refrain from making statements that are likely to incite violence or civil unrest. Please refrain from making comments or engaging in conduct that has the potential to incite violence, create civil unrest, or jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals.""[246] Blanche had stated that Trump was ""frustrated, upset, and believes that there is a grave injustice happening with him being in this courtroom today"" which Merchan rebuked ""I don\'t share your view that certain language and certain rhetoric is just by frustration.""[246] Merchan did not seek to impose a gag order at the time.[247]\n\nOn February 26, 2024, the Manhattan DA asked for a gag order on Trump, noting that Trump has been fined $15,000 for two violations of a gag order in the civil fraud trial by disparaging the judge\'s law clerk on social media, and reporting that police had logged 89 threats to Bragg, his family, or staff in 2023 (as opposed to a single threat in 2022).[248] On March 7, Merchan ruled that the jury would be anonymous except to some involved in the trial, including Trump, his lawyers, and prosecutors.[249] On March 26, Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump, restricting what he could say publicly about people involved in the case.[250] Additionally, the judge warned the defense, under the threat of contempt, against dilatory tactics such as the late filing of pretrial motions or last-minute demands, pointing out that Trump had ""stated publicly that the defense goal is to delay these proceedings ... past the 2024 presidential election"".[251][252] On March 26, Trump made online posts attacking the judge, the gag order, and Merchan\'s daughter, the latter over an anti-Trump social-media post created by someone impersonating her on social media.[253][254][255] The same day, Merchan imposed a gag order forbidding Trump to publicly comment on court staff, prosecutors, prospective jurors, or their families, or to cause others to make such statements, in a way that interferes with the case. Bragg (as a public figure) and Merchan (as the judge) were specifically exempted from protection.[256][257] The court also ordered Trump not to comment on prospective trial witnesses concerning their potential participation in the criminal case.[258]\n\nOn March 27 and 28, Trump again attacked Merchan\'s daughter on social media.[257][259] On March 29, prosecutors requested that the limits of the gag order be explicated regarding family of court staff in hopes of terminating what they considered intentionally defiant behavior by Trump.[254][260] On April 1, Merchan expanded the gag order to protect his and Bragg\'s family members, saying attacks on them ""serve no legitimate purpose"".[261][262] He wrote that Trump\'s continued attacks posted a ""very real"" threat to the integrity of proceedings and could cause those involved in the case to fear for themselves and their families, which would ""undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself"".[263] On April 11, Trump disparaged expected witnesses Cohen and Daniels on social media, referring to them as dishonest ""sleaze bags"".[258] On May 6, Merchan found Trump in contempt of court for the tenth time, but stated that he did not wish to jail Trump due to the fact that Trump was a former and potentially the next president.[264]\n\nContempt hearings were later held concerning numerous alleged violations of the gag order. On May 14, a New York appeals court denied Trump\'s request to overturn the order.[265]\n\nAlso on May 14, United States Senator Tommy Tuberville called the gag order ""ridiculous"" for stopping Trump ""from having a say-so in his own trial""; Tuberville further said that members of Congress were attending the trial ""to speak our piece for President Trump"" and ""overcome this gag order"", and he hoped that ""more and more"" members of Congress would do so.[266] Republican members of Congress, including Tuberville, JD Vance, Cory Mills, Nicole Malliotakis and Speaker Mike Johnson, have criticized witness Michael Cohen, while Byron Donalds, Rick Scott, Vance, and Johnson have criticized Merchan\'s daughter.[267][268][269][270] New York magazine journalist Andrew Rice claimed that during Cohen\'s May 13 testimony, he saw Trump penning revision notes as to statements about the case from his Republican allies.[271] On May 14, Trump commented that ""I do have a lot of surrogates, and they\'re speaking very beautifully.""[272]\n\nOn May 20, speaking outside the courtroom, Trump mentioned witnesses Robert Costello and Michael Cohen.[273]\n\nOn June 25, Merchan lifted parts of Trump\'s gag order, allowing him to talk about the jury and witnesses who took the stand during the trial.[274] Merchan also stated that the gag order would be completely lifted following sentencing.[275]\n\nStatute of limitations\n\nIn New York, the statute of limitations is typically two years for misdemeanors and five years for felonies.[276] Though falsifying business records is typically a misdemeanor, in New York, the charges are upgraded to a felony when used to commit or conceal another crime.[276] Trump was charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, which is a Class E felony (the least severe), whose statute of limitations is five years.[276] On March 20, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued Executive Order No. 202.8 tolling (pausing) the statute of limitations for ""any specific time limit for the commencement, filing, or service of any legal action, notice, motion, or other process or proceeding, as prescribed by the procedural laws of the state"".[276]\n\nMerchan ruled the tolling deadline was through May 6, 2021, thus extending the deadline for the prosecution by one year and 47 days, allowing the felony prosecution to commence within 6 years and 47 days from when the crime was committed.[276] Trump\'s first indictment occurred on February 14, 2017, and the indictment was filed on March 3, 2023, within days of the deadline.[276] On February 14, 2024, Merchan ruled that the tolled period was sufficient.[276]\n\nThe New York statute of limitations provision, CPL§30.10, permits tolling of up to five years while the defendant is continuously outside the state.[276] During his presidency, Trump spent the majority of his time outside New York.[276] Merchan declined to address where this provision was applicable as the tolling occasioned by the Governor\'s Executive Order was sufficient.[277]\n\nOverview of witnesses\n\nProsecution witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Witness Date Function David Pecker April 22 Publisher of National Enquirer April 23 April 25 April 26 Rhona Graff April 26 Donald Trump executive assistant April 30 Gary Farro April 30 First Republic banker Robert Browning April 30 C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Phillip Thompson April 30 Regional Director of Esquire Deposition Solutions Keith Davidson April 30 Former attorney for Stormy Daniels May 2 Douglas Daus May 2 Computer forensics specialist in the Manhattan DA\'s office Hope Hicks May 3 Former White House Communications Director Jeffrey McConney May 6 Former Trump Organization comptroller Deborah Tarasoff May 6 Trump Organization accounting employee Sally Franklin May 7 Penguin Books executive Stormy Daniels May 7 Hush money recipient May 9 Rebecca Manochio May 9 Trump Organization bookkeeper Tracey Menzies May 9 Senior vice president at HarperCollins Madeleine Westerhout May 9 Former Director of Oval Office Operations May 10 Jennie Tomalin May 10 Verizon senior analyst Daniel Dixon May 10 AT&T compliance analyst Jaden Jarmel-Schneider May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Georgia Longstreet May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Michael Cohen May 13 Hush money intermediary May 14 May 16 May 20\n\nDefense witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Date Witness Function Daniel Sitko May 20 Paralegal for defense attorney Robert Costello May 20 Associate of Michael Cohen May 21\n\nTrial\n\nThe trial began on April 15, 2024, with recessed Wednesdays.[278] Trump was required to attend every day of trial barring a court-approved absence.[279] If he chose to testify, prosecutors could have asked him about his civil lawsuits regarding business fraud, sexual abuse, and defamation as well as the 2018 dissolution of his charitable foundation.[280] Attorneys Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles represented him.[281]\n\nThe trial was not televised.[282] Initially, Merchan allowed photographers to stand at the front of the room for a few minutes each morning before the trial began to take photos of Trump seated. Merchan withdrew this permission on May 9 after at least one photo was taken from the side of the table.[283] There are courtroom sketch artists present to capture the milieu.[284][r]\n\nThe temperature in the trial courtroom was a point of contention, with Trump repeatedly complaining that it was too cold, akin to an icebox, possibly intentionally.[289][290][291] Judge Juan Merchan acknowledged that the courtroom was chilly, but has stated that he would rather it be a little cold than too hot, and that climate control is limited in the 80-year-old building.[292][291] Despite Trump\'s complaints, reporters in the courtroom noted that the temperature was not as cold as he claims.[293]\n\nJury selection and opening statements\n\nOn April 8, 2024, the judge gave attorneys a copy of the jury selection questionnaire,[294] with jury selection beginning on April 15[295][296] from a pool of over 500 candidates.[297]\n\nOver the first two days, 96 potential jurors appeared, of which more than half were immediately dismissed after indicating that they could not be impartial. Nine jurors provisionally qualified on the first day, and an additional ten on the second;[298][299][300] from these 19, seven jurors were selected and sworn in.[s]\n\nHowever, two were excused on April 18, one of whom complaining that her friends and family had recognized her from details published in the news.[300][303][304] Trump was reprimanded by the judge on April 16 for gesturing and audibly speaking in the direction of a potential juror.[305][306]\n\nAnother group of 96 potential jurors was brought in later in the week.[304] Twelve jurors, along with one alternate, were selected by April 18.[307] The selection of six alternate jurors concluded on April 19.[308][309] The jury reportedly comprised seven men and five women, who mostly had white-collar careers.[310] The jurors were allowed to tell their family and employers that they were on the jury but could not discuss the case with them.[311]\n\nTrump was described as falling asleep for brief intervals on four out of the first five days of the trial, ahead of opening statements,[312][313][314][315][316] and as being flatulent.[t] Trump has denied dozing off at his trial.[u]\n\nOn April 22, opening statements began.[328] Prosecutors accused Trump, Cohen, and Pecker of campaign finance violations, alleging they coordinated payments to two women and concealed them as part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.[329] During their opening statements, prosecutors said the jury would be presented with a document with a handwritten note in the margin by Allen Weisselberg outlining the hush-money payment scheme.[330][331]\n\nThe defense argued that the testimony of Cohen, a convicted felon, could not be trusted; that the payments were ordinary business transactions, akin to editorial decisions made by newspapers;[332] and that in democracies it is normal for candidates to attempt to influence an election.[329]\n\nContempt hearings\n\nOn April 15, prosecutors asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for three alleged violations of the gag order against him;[307] prosecutors also requested to use the attacks on Cohen as evidence.[298][258][333] By the morning of April 18, prosecutors alleged that Trump incurred seven further violations of the order and requested that he be fined another $7,000.[307]\n\nOn April 23, Merchan heard arguments about whether Trump had violated the earlier gag order when he made social-media posts about two expected witnesses.[334] Merchan criticized Trump\'s attorney Todd Blanche for failing to justify Trump\'s claim that he was merely responding to ""political attacks"" and for failing to provide any legal precedent supporting Trump\'s claim that reposting an article could not be a violation of a gag order; Merchan told Blanche, ""You\'re losing credibility.""[334][335] Merchan rejected Trump\'s position that reposting a news article to social media was a merely ""passive"" rather than active act.[336][v] The defense also declared that ""Trump absolutely knows what the gag order allows him to do and does not allow him to do.""[336]\n\nOn April 30, Trump became the first U.S. president ever to be held in criminal contempt of court, under NY Judiciary Law Section 750(3).[337] (Trump had previously been held in civil contempt, for withholding documents, in the New York business fraud case.)[338] Trump was found in contempt on nine of the ten counts, regarding statements made from April 10–17.[339] Over the next few days, he paid a $9,000 fine.[340][341][342] Merchan said he would consider jailing Trump for further violations ""if necessary and appropriate"".[343]\n\nOn May 2, a second hearing was held to consider four further violation claims.[w] The prosecution said it was ""not yet seeking jail"".[348][349] On May 6, Trump was found in contempt for one of those four claims (when he on April 22 commented on the jury) and was fined $1,000.[x] The judge again warned Trump of possible incarceration for further violations.[352]\n\nThe mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, said that corrections officials would be ""ready"" if the judge ordered incarceration.[353]\n\nProsecution witnesses\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nProsecutors called former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker to testify on April 22, 23, 25 and 26 as the trial\'s first witness, taking most of the first week of testimony.[354] He had been given immunity in 2018 in a federal investigation into Michael Cohen in exchange for information regarding hush money deals.[355] During Pecker\'s testimony, it was implied that former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, who Pecker stated was now living in Australia and suffering from a ""spinal condition"", would not testify.[354][356] It was previously reported that while Pecker and his company American Media Inc. (AMI), the National Enquirer\'s parent company, facilitated payment to McDougal,[357] Pecker refused to personally do the same with Daniels,[358][359] though he allegedly alerted Trump associates about Daniels\' decision to go public with her affair allegation.[360] On April 23, Pecker testified that Cohen used to feed him negative stories about Trump\'s enemies, which Pecker\'s staff would then ""embellish"" and show drafts to Cohen to get his feedback before publishing them.[361] Pecker also detailed how he offered to deploy the ""catch and kill"" scheme, stating that he offered in 2015 to suppress negative stories about Trump and flag efforts by women attempting to sell stories about him.[362] The prosecution cited a state election law regarding conspiracy to defend their questioning of Pecker about his contacts with Steve Bannon, the chief executive officer of Trump\'s 2016 campaign.[363]\n\nOn April 25, Pecker testified that AMI suppressed negative press about other celebrities, which was emphasized by Trump\'s team in their cross-examination.[364] Additionally, he stated that he did not believe Cohen was working for Trump\'s campaign.[365] Pecker discussed his relationship with Trump prior to the 2016 campaign, during which he suppressed other negative stories about him. Pecker detailed how his company, Trump and Cohen facilitated payment to McDougal in mid-2016, in tandem with promising her a ghostwritten monthly column in an attempt to disguise the contract\'s true nature.[364][282][366] In September 2016, Cohen asked to purchase the boxes of McDougal\'s source material (valued by Pecker at $25,000) on Trump\'s behalf. Pecker then told Cohen that he did not want to be reimbursed for the payment to McDougal. According to Pecker, an AMI staff member leaked details of the scheme on November 4, 2016, ahead of the election, after which Pecker released a false statement that AMI had never paid anyone to kill damaging stories about Trump. AMI then amended its contract with McDougal allowing her to speak to the press.[366] Pecker also described a January 2017 meeting in Trump Tower in which Trump thanked Pecker for his work regarding McDougal and another story.[366][367][y] Pecker said his decision not to facilitate payment to Daniels (because she was a porn star) led to it being done by Cohen.[364] Pecker testified he acted at Trump\'s behest and intended to help him win the presidency, despite his own doubts regarding campaign-finance laws.[366][368] Additionally, Pecker said that after receiving a letter from the Federal Election Commission about possible campaign violations in mid-2021, he signed a non-prosecution deal with federal prosecutors for his cooperation.[366]\n\nGraff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson\n\nFour witnesses testified over the latter part of April 26 through the earlier part of April 30.\n\nOn April 26, Trump\'s executive assistant Rhona Graff testified that when she worked outside Trump\'s office in Trump Tower, she maintained contact information for McDougal and Daniels,[369] and that she had a ""vague recollection"" of glimpsing Daniels at a Trump Tower reception area.[370] During her cross-examination by the defense, Graff said Trump was sometimes prone to multitasking while signing checks, depending ""what was going on ... and how important the checks were"".[17][371]\n\nAdditional testimony was also provided by former First Republic banker Gary Farro on April 26 and 30. He testified that on October 26, 2016, he helped Cohen open an account for a real-estate limited liability company. According to prosecutors, the same day, Cohen deposited $131,000 from his personal home-equity credit line, and the next day transferred $130,000 to Daniels\' lawyer, Keith Davidson.[370][372][373] He detailed how he assisted in setting up the bank account which enabled Cohen to make the hush money payment. Farro stated that Cohen was eager to connect with him, and would set up the account in October 2016. Farro also noted that the account was set up for Essential Consultants LLC, the company the payment was made from, and that it was funded through Cohen\'s home-equity line of credit at First Republic.[373][374] According to Farro, Cohen did not want addresses on the checks.[373] Prosecution also presented evidence showing emails to and from Cohen, which confirmed the $131,000 deposit to a checking account 20 minutes after it was opened.[374] In texts between Davidson and Cohen, Davidson provided wiring instructions for the $130,000 hush-money payment. According to Farro, First Republic closed Cohen\'s accounts after the payment to Daniels became public.[375]\n\nApril 30 also saw testimony from C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Robert Browning, who verified the authenticity of C-SPAN videos of Trump, as well as Phillip Thompson, a regional director of Esquire Deposition Solutions, which provided court reporter services for Trump\'s October 2022 deposition in one of the E. Jean Carroll defamation cases.[376][377]\n\nOn May 20, the prosecution tried to contact Browning to see if he would be available to testify again, this time regarding a photograph of Trump with his former bodyguard Keith Schiller.[378][379]\n\nKeith Davidson and Douglas Daus\n\nSee also: Keith Davidson § Stormy Daniels\n\nKeith Davidson, a former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, appeared on April 30 and May 2. He testified that the Access Hollywood tape helped influence Daniels to go forward with her story.[380] According to Davidson\'s testimony, he drafted the $130,000 hush-money agreement, in which he used the pseudonyms ""Peggy Peterson"" for Daniels and ""David Dennison"" for Trump.[381] The agreement called for payment by October 14, 2016. When the payment did not arrive, Davidson communicated with Cohen,[382] who told him that Trump was traveling.[383] On October 17, Davidson wrote to Cohen that the agreement was void and furthermore that he would no longer be representing Daniels.[384] (Cohen would wire his personal funds to Davidson on October 27.)[385]\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Trump was behind the hush-money talks.[386] However, he also acknowledged how Cohen wired the transfer and that he also had conversations with Howard as well as Daniels\' manager Gina Rodriguez regarding the deal. Howard and Rodriguez, who had no direct roles, would encourage Davidson to connect with Cohen. Daniels, Davidson and Rodriguez were also revealed to have received part of the $130,000 settlement payment. Davidson\'s role in the $150,000 deal with AMI for McDougal\'s story was noted as well.[375]\n\nOn May 2, the jury heard an audio recording of Cohen and Trump from September 6, 2016 appearing to discuss paying Pecker for McDougal\'s story, wherein Cohen mentions talking to Weisselberg about setting up the payment and Trump asks, ""So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?""[387] Further audio was played of a phone call in which Cohen tells Davidson that ""I can\'t even tell you how many times [Trump] said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it,"" apparently regarding the payment to Daniels.[157] Davidson acknowledged texting Howard on Election Night 2016: ""What have we done?"", to which Howard responded ""Oh my god.""[158] Davidson explained that this was a recognition that ""our activities may have assisted the presidential campaign"" and that it was ""sort of gallows humor"".[388] He also confirmed that, after texting with Cohen on February 13, 2018, he sent a statement to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo to corroborate Cohen\'s claim of having paid $130,000 to Daniels from his personal funds.[389] Davidson testified during his cross-examination that he had never personally met Trump.[157]\n\nOn May 2, prosecutors called Douglas Daus, a computer forensics specialist in the district attorney\'s office. Daus testified to examinations of Cohen\'s cell phones. Several of the prosecutions proposed exhibits were found by Daus.[390]\n\nHope Hicks\n\nSee also: Hope Hicks § Career\n\nOn May 3, former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified. She said a Wall Street Journal reporter asked her for comment on the alleged Trump–McDougal affair, which is how she learned that AMI had paid to catch and kill the story.[391] She stated that she drafted a statement to respond to The Wall Street Journal, with Cohen offering feedback, but Trump overrode them by telling Hicks to say that McDougal\'s allegations were ""totally untrue"",[392][393] which is how she was quoted by the Journal just days before the election.[394][357] Hicks also learned at this time that the Journal planned to publish details of Daniels\' allegations, with Trump instructing Hicks to deny any affair.[395] Hicks stated that Trump sought to hide news of both scandals from Melania,[396][395] and after the story of the payment to Daniels broke in early 2018, Trump told her that Cohen had voluntarily decided to pay Daniels to protect him; Hicks opined that this seemed out of character for Cohen.[395] Trump sought Hicks\'s opinion about how the Daniels story was being perceived, especially in relation to the negative impact it may have had if Cohen had not paid Daniels before the election.[393][397] Hicks further testified that she had heard Trump praise Pecker on multiple occasions for his negative reporting on his Republican rivals in the 2016 election.[395]\n\nAccording to Hicks, the Access Hollywood tape roiled the Trump campaign.[395] Though Trump tried to minimize its significance,[398] the campaign felt the tape was a ""crisis"".[399] Hicks stated that the tape\'s release stressed Trump because he wanted members of his family, including Melania, to be proud of him and not hurt or embarrassed.[400] In her cross-examination by the defense, Hicks stated that Trump ""is a very good multitasker [who] is always doing many things at once"".[371]\n\nMcConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin\n\nThree witnesses appeared during May 6 and the earlier part of May 7.\n\nOn May 6, former Trump Organization comptroller Jeffrey McConney testified about how Cohen was reimbursed.[401] He testified that Weisselberg instructed him in early 2017 to send the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401][402][403] McConney acknowledged that he told organization payroll specialist (and its accounts payable supervisor) Deborah Tarasoff to record the reimbursement payments as ""legal expenses""; he said he told her these payments were part of a retainer agreement between Cohen and Trump.[401] McConney further stated that starting in March 2017, the reimbursement checks for Cohen came from Trump\'s personal bank account.[401] In 2017, Cohen quit working for Trump after setting up shop at Squire Patton Boggs\'s offices in Midtown, but nevertheless still identified himself as Trump\'s personal lawyer.[401] Numerous invoice messages from Cohen and related emails between McConney, Tarasoff and Weisselberg were shown in the courtroom.[401] Several general ledger documents associated with Trump and his trust were reviewed which showed that Trump made the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401]\n\nFollowing McConney\'s testimony, Deborah Tarasoff, a 24-year employee of the Trump Organization who works in accounting, took the stand to testify. She said the organization was paying for her attorney.[404][401] She described her job duties: ""I get approved bills, I enter them into the system, and I cut checks.""[405] Tarasoff stated that she had no decision-making authority and merely followed instructions, but also acknowledged that she would approve invoices if she got them, including the ones which were sent to Cohen.[402] Tarasoff testified that while either Trump or one of his two older sons could approve invoices of over $10,000 since 2015, only Trump could access his personal checking account.[402] Twelve reimbursement checks for $35,000 were signed by Trump, and Tarasoff testified that they were mailed to Cohen.[402] Trump, who used a Sharpie pen when writing checks, could write ""void"" if he disapproved of checks Tarasoff created for the company[402] (e.g. a $70,000 check to Cohen signed by Eric Trump and Wiesselberg in February 2017, which was voided by Trump).[402] She testified that Weisselberg ""had his hands in everything"".[403] During cross-examination, Tarasoff acknowledged that she not was present for conversations between Trump and Weisselberg about the payments.[402]\n\nOn May 7, 2024, Penguin Books executive Sally Franklin testified. Franklin, whose company published a few Trump books, read excerpts from Trump: How to Get Rich and Trump: Think Like a Billionaire, including Trump quotes, ""If you don\'t know every aspect of what you\'re doing, down to the paper clips, you\'re setting yourself up for some unwanted surprises,"" and, ""For many years, I\'ve said that if someone screws you, screw them back.""[406]\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nStormy Daniels testified for five hours on May 7,[407] and for the earlier part of May 9.[408] She said she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 2006 and detailed a sexual encounter with Trump in his hotel suite after he invited her to dinner.[407][409] Daniels stated that Trump did not use a condom and that during the encounter, ""I was staring up at the ceiling, wondering how I got there,"" despite not having used drugs or alcohol.[407][z] She said she felt like she blacked out during the encounter and was traumatized by the experience.[411][409] It was the only time they reputedly had sex.[412] Daniels said Trump offered to make her a contestant on The Apprentice; she stated that he continued alluding to the idea for a time in subsequent phone conversations, in which he referred to her as ""honey bunch"" and asked when they could meet again.[406][409] Daniels noted that she met with Trump on multiple occasions, with dozens of witnesses,[409] including a visit to Trump Tower and a final encounter with Trump in Los Angeles in 2007.[409]\n\nIn accepting the hush money, Daniels stated that she was not motivated by money (although this appeared to be contradicted by a text message between her and her manager Gina Rodriguez which suggested she was willing to accept the payment).[409] She stated that she had no part in the hush-money negotiations.[409] Daniels also laid out key information about the payment.[409] She maintained her previous allegation that someone threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot, stating that she did not report it because it would have been upsetting to Trump.[409] Daniels stated that any violation of the hush-money agreement would have cost her a million dollars.[409]\n\nDuring Daniels\' testimony, Merchan sustained many defense objections.[409] He repeatedly admonished Daniels for giving answers that went beyond the scope of the question asked, and at one point interrupting Daniels\' testimony, stopping her from describing the sexual position she and Trump used.[407][409] Merchan criticized the ""degree of detail"" on matters such as the floor size of the hotel suite.[406] In a sidebar conference, Merchan agreed with defense arguments that Daniels described things which were ""better left unsaid"" regarding the sexual encounter, but denied the defense\'s request for a mistrial, noting that the defense would have the opportunity to cross-examine Daniels.[407][409] Merchan set confines for Daniels\' later testimony and directed the prosecution to encourage her to give shorter answers.[409] Afterward, Daniels gave shorter answers and hewed closer to the question asked.[407]\n\nWhen testimony resumed, Daniels stated that her lawyer Keith Davidson received the $130,000 hush-money payment, and that she got $96,000 of it. She also acknowledged that she signed a statement dated January 10, 2018, in which she denied the affair, but testified that she did not want to sign it and that it was untrue.[409]\n\nIn its cross-examination, the defense questioned Daniels about her account of being traumatized by her encounter with Trump, suggesting that her pornographic career would have made the event unsurprising. Daniels explained that the first time she realized the meeting was intended to be sexual was upon coming out of the bathroom inside Trump\'s hotel, finding him stripped to his boxers; she elaborated that she was ""not expecting [this from] a man twice [her] age"".[411] Daniels acknowledged that she had contacted renowned high-profile sexual harassment attorney Gloria Allred about potentially suing Trump for the encounter. Much of the cross-examination focused on questioning the accuracy of her allegation that she was threatened in a Las Vegas parking lot, which was revealed to have been disputed by Davidson via texts with Cohen. Despite accepting the hush money, Daniels maintained that her primary goal was to ""get the story out"".[409]\n\nOn May 9, Daniels concluded her testimony after hours of cross-examination.[408] Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Daniels on how she profited from her story and brought up minor inconsistencies in how she has told it.[408] Merchan again denied a defense motion for a mistrial, but would provide the jury instructions instructions limiting the use of her testimony.[413][414] [aa] Trump criticized Merchan for permitting the testimony stating ""He’s [Merchan] trying to make it as salacious as possible by allowing testimony that has nothing to do with the case.""[418]\n\nManochio, Menzies, and Westerhout\n\nOn May 9, Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper at the Trump Organization, testified for about a half-hour. She had provided evidence to the prosecution.[419][420] Tracy Menzies, a senior vice president at HarperCollins, then testified about the accuracy of certain excerpts from the book Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life, which Trump had co-authored.[421]\n\nTrump\'s director of Oval Office Operations in 2019 and former Secretary to the President between 2017 and 2019, Madeleine Westerhout, also began testifying the same day.[408][414] She stated that Republican National Committee officials she was working with in 2016 discussed how to replace Trump as the Republican presidential nominee due to concern about the damaging Access Hollywood tape.[422] She also noted how she set up a meeting between Cohen and Trump in February 2017, and how the meeting led to Trump Organization employees sending reimbursement checks to the White House—which Trump would then sign and send to Cohen—through a circuitous mail system.[423] She was in tears when discussing how Trump fired her, reportedly in response to her telling reporters that she had a better relationship with him than his daughters.[424]\n\nWesterhout resumed testifying on May 10.[423] During cross-examination, Westerhout appeared to side with defense arguments that Trump used alternatives to the White House mail system because he wanted to get mail to people more quickly.[423]\n\nDixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider\n\nFor the later part of May 10, four other witnesses testified.[425] Among these witnesses were Jennie Tomalin (a Verizon senior analyst), Daniel Dixon (an AT&T compliance analyst), and Jaden Jarmel-Schneider (a paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office).[423] In successive testimonies, Dixon and Tomalin would authenticate cell phone records which were used as trial evidence.[423] Georgia Longstreet, another paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office, again testified after previously doing so days prior.[423] Longstreet also showed some of Trump\'s old tweets, as well as texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard.[423] Jarmel-Schneider then showed a chart which summarized 34 business records which prosecutors say were falsified.[423]\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nOn May 13, Michael Cohen, Trump\'s former ""fixer"" and attorney (who is considered the case\'s star witness), began testifying.[426] He would give 17 hours of testimony over four days.[427]\n\nOn May 13, Cohen acknowledged that he, Trump and David Pecker conspired to suppress negative stories and promote positive stories about Trump during the 2016 election.[426] He said his work in this matter ""was at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump"", stating that ""Everything required Mr. Trump\'s sign-off.""[428] By email (shown as evidence), Cohen informed the National Enquirer that Trump did not want them to report his affair with a ""Penthouse Pet"".[426] Cohen specified his role in the Enquirer\'s first catch-and-kill story for Trump, about a Trump Tower doorman who alleged that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.[426] Cohen detailed his role in the hush-money payment to McDougal, stating that he monitored progress by text, phone and the Signal app.[426] He repeated that he communicated by ""phone, email and text"" with McDougal, Daniels and Keith Davidson.[426][9] By text message, Cohen told Dylan Howard that he was making the payments on Trump\'s behalf.[426] He further noted that after Pecker refused to pay for the Daniels story, he took over as funder of ""catch-and-kill operations"".[426]\n\nCohen acknowledged Hicks\'s testimony about the conversation over the McDougal payment press coverage.[426] According to Cohen, he and everybody at the organization had contact with Weisselberg.[426] He further accused Weisselberg of providing him with the financial advice concerning the payment to McDougal, stating that it foreshadowed the way he arranged for the Daniels payment.[426] Cohen said he first spoke to Trump about the Daniels allegation in 2011 after it was leaked to The Dirty, and that Trump called her ""a beautiful woman"" (having said the same about McDougal) and said they had met in 2006 at a golf outing and that she had liked him more than football star ""Big Ben"". Cohen said Trump did not respond when he asked if he had had sex with her and that Trump took him up on his offer to get the story taken down.[9]\n\nCohen said the release of the Access Hollywood tape was viewed as a campaign liability and that Trump afterwards directed him to pay Daniels to avoid ""catastrophic"" damage.[426][9] Cohen said that he viewed supermarket tabloids like the National Enquirer to be influential in reaching voters[426] and that Trump was concerned about the effect Daniels\' story could have had on female voters.[426] Cohen stated that Trump told him: ""Just pay it. There\'s no reason to keep this thing out there. Just do it.""[429] Cohen testified that Weisselberg told him to not make the payment through the Trump Organization and instead to come up with a more creative way to do it.[426] Cohen said that he and Weisselberg discussed processing the $130,000 through one of Trump\'s golf courses as if it were a membership or event fee but they decided against it. When Weisselberg said he lacked the personal finances, Cohen agreed to pay it.[429] Cohen said he suggested the idea of including a clause in the nondisclosure agreement penalizing Daniels $1,000,000 every time she told her story.[426] After Trump\'s 2016 election victory, Weisselberg and Cohen discussed the reimbursement plan in Trump\'s 26th-floor office, and Weisselberg coordinated the repayments to Cohen.[426] A bank statement for Essential Consultants LLC from the end of October 2016 was presented, which showed the $130,000 sent to Keith Davidson and featured a note Cohen said was handwritten by Weisselberg. It showed the doubling of the $180,000 reimbursement—$130,000 for Daniels plus $50,000 for money Trump owed Cohen for paying tech company Red Finch (to poll for the Trump campaign and promote Cohen on Twitter as something of a sex symbol)—so that Cohen would receive the full amount after paying 50% in taxes, plus a $60,000 year-end bonus, totaling $420,000. Cohen said it occurred to him that Weisselberg and Trump had planned this reimbursement scheme in advance and that Weisselberg had said in Trump\'s presence that the monthly payments would function in the guise of a retainer agreement.[430][401]\n\nCohen testified that he aspired to be a personal lawyer to the president but that Trump, instead of granting him this role, significantly cut his 2016 bonus. Cohen said his relationship with Trump was falling apart at this time. He said his work for Trump boosted his personal career, including by securing more prominent clients.[426]\n\nOn May 14, Cohen said he sent the Trump Organization false invoices requesting money for ""services rendered"". He said that, in February 2017, he confronted Trump in the Oval Office over his lack of repayment.[431] He said he lied about Daniels to protect Trump (while also ""staying on Trump\'s message"" by lying about the Trump Tower Moscow project).[432] Cohen testified that, in January 2018, he pressured Davidson to have Daniels sign a false statement denying the affair and payment, which Daniels signed on January 30, and also offered her an appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity.[433][434] Cohen testified that Daniels also wanted an appearance on Fox News\' Hannity, which she did not go through with.[435][434] Cohen also testified that he decided to stop lying for Trump following a meeting he had with his family shortly before his 2018 guilty plea.[435] Before the day concluded, Cohen began defense cross-examination.[435] On May 16, a Trump lawyer accused Cohen of lying that on October 26, 2016, he was on the phone with Trump\'s personal bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and had him hand the phone to Trump, who then approved the hush-money deal. The defense cited phone records as showing that a series of prank calls to Cohen had prompted him to contact Schiller for a call lasting one minute and 36 seconds, which Cohen defended as enough time to handle both matters.[436]\n\nOn May 20, during cross-examination, Cohen confirmed that around October 26, 2016, he helped Tiffany Trump regarding an extortion issue she faced. He said he was also working with David Pecker that month.[437] Cohen made two brief calls to Donald Trump on the morning of October 26,[438] which he said were about Daniels.[439] On January 27, 2017, Cohen told the Trump Organization he would no longer be working at Trump Tower because he was now Trump\'s ""personal attorney"".[440] On January 31, 2017, Weisselberg emailed Cohen with the subject: ""Note and mortgage modification agreement for Trump Park Avenue Condominium."" Weisselberg asked Cohen to ""prepare the agreement discussed"" so Weisselberg could start sending monthly payments.[441] Cohen said that Donald Jr. and Eric Trump signed the checks ""because they were the trustees"".[442] In 2017, he received nine checks for $35,000 apiece directly from Trump, plus two checks from the trust.[443] Cohen confirmed that he lied to Weisselberg about how much he had paid Red Finch, and that his false reimbursement request amounted to theft from the organization.[444][445][446][447] He said he lied in 2018 when he said that Trump had been unaware of the Daniels payment.[448] He said he had no income between his 2018 guilty plea[449] and the publication of his 2020 memoir,[450] but that since then he had earned $4.4 million from podcasts and books.[451] Asked whether he has a ""financial interest in the outcome of this case"", Cohen said he expected to make more money if Trump was found not guilty, since ""it gives me more to talk about"".[452][453] He acknowledged that his name recognition comes from his frequent criticism of Trump and that he was even interested in running for Congress.[446]\n\nDefense cross-examination of Cohen concluded on May 20. Cohen testified that the retainer agreement Weisselberg proposed he maintain with Trump to conceal the monthly reimbursements was fraudulent in nature.[454][430]\n\nThe defense pointed to occasions when Cohen did legal work, and said this was evidence that he was retained as a lawyer under a valid retainer agreement, as Cohen would not do legal work for free, nor would Trump pay in excess of reimbursements. Additionally, the defense pointed out that CFO Weisselberg requested from Cohen an agreement without suggesting it would be a fake agreement: ""please prepare the agreement we discussed so we can pay you monthly.""[455][456][457]\n\nThe prosecution then conducted redirect examination. The prosecution rested its case the same day.[458][459][460]\n\nDefense witnesses\n\nThe defense began its case on May 20, 2024, and rested its case on May 21 after calling two witnesses.[427][461] Trump did not testify.[462][463][ab] On May 22, he stated (in a press interview outside the court proceedings) that he did not testify because (1) he disagreed with Merchan\'s past rulings, (2) he was concerned about being questioned about his own past, and (3) there was ""no case"".[464][471][ac]\n\nThe defense team had initially planned to call Bradley Smith, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as an expert witness on campaign finance law.[473] Smith had argued that the payments to Daniels were not campaign payments and not illegal.[474] However, on May 20, Judge Merchan ruled that Smith\'s testimony would be limited to ""general definitions and terms"" so as to not supplant the judge\'s role to determine what the law is.[475][476] Smith was prohibited from mentioning ""there had never been a case in which anyone had been convicted of a federal campaign finance law violation for the making of \'hush money payments\'"" and from discussing ""that the FEC dismissed the complaint against defendant and the DOJ decided against prosecuting defendant for potential FECA violations"" due to irrelevance.[477] In February 2024, prosecutors pointed out that Smith had previously been barred from testifying for the defense in two unrelated federal cases in Manhattan where the defense had improperly sought to have Smith interpret campaign finance law for the jury: United States v. Bankman-Fried and United States v. Suarez.[476] As a result, the defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.[478][479] Trump then falsely stated that Merchan had not allowed Smith to be called,[480] and Smith wrote that the ""judge\'s bias is very evident.""[481]\n\nDaniel Sitko\n\nOn May 20, Daniel Sitko, a paralegal for Todd Blanche, provided testimony.[482] A chart of phone calls between Cohen and Robert Costello, the lawyer that Giuliani suggested Cohen hire in 2018, was submitted into evidence.[483]\n\nRobert Costello\n\nOn May 20, Robert Costello also testified.[484] Merchan admonished the witness for making comments on the stand objecting to rulings, staring at the judge, and rolling his eyes.[485]\n\nOn May 21, Costello was cross-examined by the prosecution.[486] Emails from Costello to his law partner Jeff Citron and Cohen were shown. In a May 2018 email to Citron, Costello said it was a goal to get Cohen ""on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president"" and said he believed it was ""the clear and correct strategy"".[486][487] When asked if ""the email speaks for itself"" as he had asserted the day before, Costello said ""Sometimes."" He also wrote to Citron about Cohen, ""What should I say to this asshole? He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet."" (Cohen testified that Costello and Trump\'s campaign had attempted to pressure him to realign to their interests.)[486] In an email to Cohen, Costello wrote: ""You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these \'journalists\' are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed. If you really believe you are not being supported properly by your former boss, then you should make your opinion known.""[486] The defense rested its case thereafter.[486]\n\nClosing arguments and jury instructions\n\nLater on May 21, arguments over jury instruction language were held.[486] Merchan announced that the jury would be excused until the beginning of summations on May 28.[486][463] Merchan stated that the closing arguments ""will not be quick"" and that he expected his final instructions to the jury to last an hour.[486] On Memorial Day, May 27, Trump complained that the prosecution would get the last word as ""very unfair"", though this is standard procedure in criminal trials where the state has the burden of proof.[488][ad]\n\nOn May 28, the defense gave a three-hour closing argument including breaks.[492] Trump lawyer Todd Blanche claimed Trump had nothing to do with checks which were written by Trump\'s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.[493] Blanche questioned why prosecutors did not call Donald Jr. and Eric as witnesses despite their signing payment checks to Cohen.[493] Blanche also showed an email revealing that McConnery sought approval from both Donald Jr. and Eric.[493] Blanche alleged that it was Cohen\'s decision to make the hush-money payment and variously branded him a prolific liar.[493] Blanche sought to discredit Daniels\' ambitions, noting (among other things) text messages between her manager and publicist Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard which showed that Howard believed Pecker would pay for her story shortly after the Access Hollywood tape was released.[493] Merchan admonished Blanche for telling the jury: ""You cannot send someone to prison, you cannot convict somebody, based upon the words of Michael Cohen."" Merchan said this type of comment is ""highly inappropriate"" and ""not allowed"",[494] as the jury is instructed not to consider how Merchan might sentence Trump.[495][496][497]\n\nThe same day, the prosecution gave a four-hour and 41 minute closing argument including breaks.[493] Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass described Pecker\'s testimony as ""utterly damning"".[493] Steinglass noted that some key parts of Daniels\' story were proven true[493] and noted that the defense appeared to acknowledge that Trump knew about the Daniels payment as early as 2017.[493] Steinglass stated that it made sense that Cohen was interested in the outcome of the case, noting that Trump dropped him ""like a hot potato"" when their relationship soured.[498] Steinglass argued that Cohen was Trump\'s ""fixer"" and that his knowledge was ""limited to what actually happened"".[493] It was noted that Cohen did not work for the Trump Organization\'s legal department and answered directly to Trump.[493] A footnote from the 2018 Office of Government Ethics form was shown, which stated that ""In 2016 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump\'s attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.""[493]\n\nSteinglass went over phone conversations between Trump and Cohen regarding the hush-money payment and showed a December 2017 check to Cohen signed via Sharpie by Donald Trump,[493] arguing that the latter must have known the purpose of such checks, as his ""entire business philosophy was and is to be involved in everything"".[499] Steinglass cited a 2018 tweet by Trump in which he acknowledged that Cohen was reimbursed for an NDA via a retainer agreement, but said it had ""nothing to do with the campaign"".[499] Steinglass said the defense\'s characterization of the payments to Cohen was undermined by his lack of pay from Trump in 2018 despite Cohen doing legal work for him that year.[499] Steinglass further stated that the payment was made to ""hoodwink the American voter"".[493][500] At the end of closing arguments, Merchan said that jury instructions would be read on May 29 and were expected to last an hour.[493] Trump described the closing arguments as ""BORING!"" on Truth Social.[501][502][503]\n\nJury deliberations and verdict\n\nOn May 29, the jury began deliberations.[504] A few hours in, they asked to hear a readback of about 30 minutes of testimony by Pecker and Cohen; the readback was held the following day.[505] It regarded an August 2015 meeting between Pecker, Cohen, Trump, and Hicks, in which Pecker pledged to be Trump\'s ""eyes and ears"" regarding negative stories about him; additionally, the jury wanted to hear Pecker\'s testimony regarding an alleged phone call from Trump in which the two discussed a rumor that McDougal had gone to another outlet to publish her story.[506][507][508]\n\nOn May 30 at 5:07 pm EDT, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts,[1][509] making him the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony.[510] Merchan denied a defense motion for an acquittal.[511]\n\nPost-trial proceedings\n\nGag order\n\nOn May 31, 2024, the day after the trial ended, Trump told reporters he wanted to have the ""nasty gag order"" lifted.[512] On June 4, Blanche filed a motion to have the gag order lifted, stating: ""Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the government and the Court do not justify restrictions on the First Amendment rights of President Trump"".[513] On June 5, Matthew Colangelo asked that the gag order remain in place to ""to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.""[514][515] Many expected Trump, had the gag order been lifted, to assail trial participants including the witnesses, jury, and court staff, as well as their families.[516][517]\n\nOn June 18, the New York Court of Appeals said it would not hear an earlier appeal by Trump on the gag order, leaving it in place.[518]\n\nOn June 25, two days before the first 2024 United States presidential debates, Merchan partially lifted the gag order permitting Trump to comment on witnesses and jurors, but Trump cannot reveal the jurors\' identities, nor comment about court staffers, the prosecution team nor their families until after sentencing.[519][520][521]\n\nIn July 2024, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a lawsuit against New York State in an attempt to invoke the Supreme Court\'s exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes between two states.[522] The lawsuit sought to block Trump\'s gag order and sentencing until after the November election, accusing New York of interfering with the presidential election in Missouri and violating Missourians\' First Amendment rights.[522] On August 5, the Supreme Court ruled against intervening in the case.[523]\n\nDelayed sentencing hearing\n\nOn June 10, 2024, Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche attended his probation interview via videoconference.[524][ae] If placed on probation, Trump cannot associate with other convicted felons.[525][529]\n\nBefore his conviction, officials in state and federal agencies began preparing for possible incarceration.[530][531] Trump\'s rhetoric and lack of acknowledgement of any wrongdoing is expected to negatively impact the leniency of his sentence.[532] Trump\'s proponents have argued that any sentence restricting Trump\'s mobility or communication with voters could undermine confidence in the 2024 election.[533] Trump was the presumptive 2024 Republican Party nominee leading up to the 2024 Republican National Convention, and the party prepared for a prison nomination broadcast were he to be incarcerated before the start of the Republican National Convention on July 15.[534]\n\nTrump\'s sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for July 11.[535] However, Trump\'s counsel requested on July 1 to delay sentencing to consider the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States released that day.[222][536] The Manhattan DA\'s office agreed to the delay, though it said the Trump team\'s position lacked merit.[537] On July 2, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to September 18.[538] In August, Trump\'s team asked Merchan to again postpone the sentencing hearing until after the election,[539] and the Manhattan DA stated that it would defer to Merchan on this matter.[540] On September 6, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to November 26.[541][542]\n\nOn August 29, Trump\'s lawyers asked the federal court for the Southern District of New York to seize control of the case, complaining that a September sentencing date would amount to election interference.[543] On September 3, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request on the basis that the payments were an unofficial act.[544][545] Hours later, Trump\'s attorneys filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.[546] Although Merchan granted the sentencing delay, on October 14 Trump\'s counsel asked the Second Circuit to reconsider Hellerstein\'s rejection, arguing that it was based upon ""profoundly flawed analysis"" and continuing to assert that instead of being personally prosecuted, Trump was being politically persecuted.[545]\n\nOn November 12, the immunity hearing was delayed a week, to November 19, likely putting the sentencing date at risk as well.[547]\n\nImmunity ruling\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States, supporting presidential immunity for official acts committed by the seated president. Later that day, Trump\'s counsel requested permission to move to dismiss the conviction on the basis that some evidence presented in the trial constituted official actions by Trump.[222][536] This includes 2018 social media posts by Trump, phone records between Trump and Cohen, a government ethics disclosure referencing the hush money payment, and some of Hicks\' and Westerhout\'s testimony.[548][549][550]\n\nTrump\'s motion was formally made on July 11.[550] Merchan\'s ruling will center on whether the evidence presented constituted official actions, and whether it influenced the verdict.[548] If the conviction is overturned, prosecutors would need to convene another grand jury to issue a new indictment.[550]\n\nJudge Hellerstein had previously rejected defense arguments to this effect in July 2023 when Trump attempted to remove the case to federal court, saying that ""the matter was purely a personal item of the President.""[352]\n\nMerchan\'s ruling on immunity was initially expected by September 6. It was postponed so he could consider Trump\'s third recusal motion, which he denied on August 13.[551] The immunity ruling was expected by September 16.[552][553] On September 3, hours before Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request to remove his case to federal court, prosecutors urged Merchan to rule swiftly on the immunity question, expressing concern that Hellerstein might pause state court proceedings.[554] On September 6, Merchan postponed the immunity ruling to November 12.[541] On that day, Merchan agreed to a request from prosecutors to pause the case for a week while they considered how Trump\'s election could impact proceedings.[555][556]\n\nFirearms and liquor licenses\n\nTrump had turned over two of the three pistols he was licensed for to the New York Police Department (NYPD) on March 31, 2023, with a third pistol moved to Florida.[557] Trump\'s New York State concealed carry license was suspended on April 1, 2023, following his indictment on criminal charges.[558] New York state law and federal law prohibit people with felony convictions from possessing firearms, and federal law even prohibits people under indictment or information for a felony (but not convicted) from possessing firearms, a violation of which can result in up to 15 years imprisonment, or life imprisonment if one is subject to the enhanced penalties imposed by the Armed Career Criminal Act.[559] [560] As of June 5, 2024, Trump\'s New York firearm license is expected to be revoked after the NYPD\'s legal bureau completes its investigation.[561] At Trump\'s pre-sentence hearing on June 10, 2024, CNN reported that Trump was still in possession of the third firearm in Florida.[562][563]\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control declined to renew the liquor licenses for Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and Colts Neck, instead issuing temporary permits.[564] The alcohol laws of New Jersey prohibit a liquor license from being issued to ""any person who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude"", typically involving a serious crime involving ""dishonesty, fraud or depravity"".[564][565][566] Though the Trump Organization has stated that Trump is not connected with the liquor licenses, New Jersey attorney general pointed out that Trump is the sole beneficiary of his revocable trust, which owns the licenses.[564][567] A hearing for the licenses was expected to be held on July 19, but was delayed until after Trump\'s sentencing.[568][564]\n\nPotential appeal of conviction\n\nTrump has a right to one level of appeal for the conviction itself, which he is expected to use.[569][462] The appeal would be heard by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, which is the intermediate state appellate court covering Manhattan and the Bronx. If unsuccessful, the next step would be the New York Court of Appeals, the state\'s highest court, which has discretion whether to hear an appeal.[570]\n\nReactions\n\nSee also\n\nArrests of Ulysses S.

Trump is a civil investigation and lawsuit by the office of the New York Attorney General (AG) alleging that The Trump Organization and several individuals (including operative members of the Trump family) engaged in financial fraud by presenting vastly disparate property values to potential lenders and tax officials, in violation ...', 'Full_text': 'American criminal and civil investigation\n\nTwo related investigations by New York State and City officials were opened by 2020 to determine whether the Trump Organization has committed financial fraud. One of these is a criminal case being conducted by the Manhattan district attorney (DA) and the other is a civil case being conducted by the New York State Attorney General (AG). The DA\'s case has led to two of the organization\'s subsidiary companies being found guilty of 17 charges including tax fraud and the indictment of Donald Trump, while the AG has succeeded in imposing an independent monitor to prevent future fraud by the organization.\n\nBy mid-2021, New York AG Letitia James had joined the DA\'s criminal probe, with the latter convening a grand jury. Prosecutors filed 10 charges against the organization, alleging that it had conducted a 15-year ""scheme to defraud"" the government, and 15 felony counts against longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg—who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 500 times in his testimony. In August 2022, Weisselberg pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against the organization in exchange for a reduced sentence. In December, the organization was convicted of all 17 criminal charges it faced. Evidence including the testimonies of Weisselberg and others indicate that he and other executives—as well as the two subsidiaries—participated in fraudulent schemes, including recording some employee bonuses as pay for contract work. A number of illegal practices were ceased around the time of Trump\'s election as U.S. president.\n\nIn 2020, Eric Trump pleaded the Fifth over 500 times in his testimony for the AG. In November 2021, The Washington Post reported that between 2011 and 2015 the organization presented several properties as being worth far more to potential lenders than to tax officials. Donald Trump reportedly pleaded the Fifth more than 400 times in his August 2022 deposition. In September, James filed a civil lawsuit against Trump, his three oldest children, and the organization for alleged fraud. Additionally, she referred the case to federal criminal prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service. In November, the New York judge overseeing the lawsuit appointed retired judge Barbara S. Jones to monitor the organization, with a trial being held from late 2023 to early 2024.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe financial statements of the Trump Organization\'s holdings are private, and there exist a wide range of estimates of the organization\'s true value. Donald Trump has been accused on several occasions of deliberately inflating the valuation of Trump Organization properties through the aggressive lobbying of the media, in particular the authors of the annual Forbes 400 list, in order to bolster his perceived net worth among the public over several decades.[1] He has released little definitive financial documentation to the public to confirm his valuation claims.[2][3][4][5] It is difficult to determine a net value for the Trump Organization\'s real-estate holdings independently since each individual property may be encumbered by debt.[1] In October 2015, Forbes published an article detailing its decades-long struggle to estimate the true net worth of Trump and the organization.[6] In 2018, a former Forbes journalist who had worked on the Forbes list claimed in an op-ed to The Washington Post that Trump had lied about his wealth to Forbes to get on the list repeatedly and suggested that Forbes\'s previous low-end estimates of Trump\'s net worth were still well above his true net worth.[1]\n\nOn a Schedule C form filed in 1984 for a purported consulting business, Trump reported no income but over $600,000 in unknown expenses. After New York State and City auditors rejected the unexplained expenses, Trump requested a tax trial. In separate 1992 trials, state and city judges ruled against Trump.[7] In the city case Trump\'s only witness was the lawyer and accountant who prepared his returns for over 20 years, who testified that although it had his signature he did not prepare the 1984 return he was presented a photocopy of (the original copy being unavailable); Trump asserted that he had been subjected to double taxation, in response to which the judge wrote that ""The problem at issue is [instead one] of no taxation.""[8] In June 2016 (during Trump\'s presidential campaign), investigative journalist David Cay Johnston argued that the proceedings demonstrated evidence of intentional tax fraud and that Trump should release his tax returns to disclose whether he had repeated such behavior.[7]\n\nIn a defamation case against TrumpNation author Timothy L. O\'Brien, Donald Trump testified in 2007 that ""I think everybody"" exaggerates their property values and that he did not do so ""beyond reason"". He said he would give his opinion to chief financial officer (CFO) Allen Weisselberg, who ""predominately"" determined final values, which Trump called ""conservative"". Regarding one case in which a property increased from $80 million in 2005 to $150 million in 2006, Trump stated, ""The property was valued very low, in my opinion, then and it became very—it just has gone up."" He was unable to provide a reason for this other than his opinion.[9] Between 2011 and 2015, the Trump Organization presented several properties as being worth millions of dollars—in one case over $500 million—more to potential lenders than to tax officials;[10] this was reported by The Washington Post in November 2021.[10] In January 2017, ahead of Trump\'s inauguration as U.S. president, his attorney Sheri Dillon announced that the organization\'s businesses would be transferred to a trust controlled by Trump\'s sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as Weisselberg.[11]\n\nIn October 2018, The New York Times published a lengthy exposé concerning Donald Trump\'s inheritance from his parents, Fred and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. It includes detailed analyses of Trump family financial records.[a] The article describes an alleged tax fraud scheme conducted by Trump and his siblings related to their joint inheritance of their parents\'s real estate holdings, effectively evading over $500 million in gift and estate taxes. The alleged schemes involve money from the companies being siphoned to the children throughout their lives and understating the value of transferred properties.[12][b] The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance announced on the day of the exposé\'s publication that it would review the allegations.[16][17] In mid-2021, Mary L. Trump (a primary source for the exposé) elaborated on how the organization used a shell corporation to siphon money, devaluing Fred Trump\'s ""core business"" to $30 million at the time of his death.[18]\n\nIn August 2018, Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance Jr. was reportedly considering a criminal investigation of the organization and two of its senior executives for their reimbursement of then-Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen for his hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels; the organization recorded the reimbursement as a legal expense although Cohen did no legal work in the matter.[19] In August 2019, Vance subpoenaed the organization\'s accountants, Mazars, for Trump\'s tax returns.[20] In July 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Trump\'s tax records could be released to prosecutors,[21] producing millions of pages of documents, reportedly including Trump\'s returns from January 2011 to August 2019.[22] In November 2022, the DA\'s office (then under Alvin Bragg) was reportedly again scrutinizing the hush-money affair, leading to Trump\'s indictment.[23] Following a Supreme Court ruling, the U.S. Treasury Department released Trump\'s returns from 2015 to 2020 to the House Ways and Means Committee,[24][25][26] and following the committee\'s vote,[26] the returns were released to the public before the end of the year.[27]\n\nIn February 2019, prompted by U.S. House Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) asking whether Trump had ever presented inflated assets to an insurance company,[28] Cohen testified to Congress that Trump ""inflated [the organization\'s] total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed amongst the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.""[29] Following Cohen\'s testimony, in March, the New York State Department of Financial Services issued a subpoena to Aon, the organization\'s longtime insurance broker.[30] The same month, the office of New York Attorney General (AG) Letitia James began investigating the organization,[31] having stated that she intended to do so during her 2018 campaign.[32] By September 2019, the organization was under federal investigation by the Southern District of New York regarding inflated insurance claims allegations.[33] By December, James\'s office had subpoenaed the organization for some records which it subsequently failed to provide for at least 21 months.[34]\n\nCriminal investigation\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 2020, the Manhattan district attorney (DA) had opened a criminal investigation to determine whether The Trump Organization, including any individuals or business entities associated with it, had committed financial fraud. The investigation led to three grand juries being convened, two of which approved indictments.\n\nThe first indictment named longtime Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and two Trump Organization business entities. Evidence against the organization indicated that Weisselberg and other executives—as well as the two subsidiaries—participated in fraudulent schemes, including recording some employee bonuses as pay for contract work.[35] Prosecutors filed 10 charges against the organization, alleging that it had conducted a 15-year ""scheme to defraud"" the government, and 15 felony counts against Weisselberg, who agreed to a plea deal in August 2022, during Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg\'s tenure. Both business entities were convicted of 17 charges including tax fraud in a trial in late 2022.[36][37]\n\nThe second indictment charged Donald Trump was criminally indicted with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in tandem with an alleged catch and kill operation to suppress negative press during his 2016 campaign, largely revolving around the hush-money payment to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.[c] On April 4, 2023, he pleaded not guilty. The trial began in April 2024, and in May a jury convicted Trump on all 34 counts.[40] The judge consented to two defense sentencing delay requests, resulting in it being scheduled for after the 2024 election.[41][42]\n\nSome conservative pundits denounced the investigation, with the Republican National Committee paying some of Trump\'s legal fees, while Democrats generally endorsed it.[citation needed] After Trump\'s indictment, Republican U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan organized a hearing against Bragg, leading the DA to sue him for alleged interference.[citation needed]\n\nTrump Corporation case\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople v. Trump Corporation is a state criminal case in New York. In July 2021, an indictment was issued against three defendants: the Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation, both constituent entities of the Trump Organization; and Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. All defendants were charged with scheming to defraud, conspiracy, tax fraud, and falsifying business records, and Weisselberg was additionally charged with grand larceny and offering a false instrument for filing.[43][44][45]\n\nIn August 2022, Weisselberg pleaded guilty to 15 felonies and agreed to testify against the organization in a plea deal.[46] On December 6, the organization was convicted of all 17 criminal charges it faced, and the organization was fined the maximum allowable $1.6 million.[47][48][49][50]\n\nAsset valuation investigation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Manhattan DA convened a second grand jury the last week of October 2021; it began to hear evidence on November 4, reportedly to consider charges related to the company\'s valuation of assets.[51] By November 22, prosecutors were scrutinizing several of the organization\'s properties for which, between 2011 and 2015, far higher values were presented to potential lenders than were reported to tax officials. In the most extreme case, in 2012, the 40 Wall Street building was cited as being worth $527 million to the former, but only $16.7 million to the latter.[52] Michael Cohen subsequently stated that prosecutors could ""indict Donald Trump tomorrow if they really wanted, and be successful"".[53]\n\nBy mid-December, an accountant for Trump had testified before the grand jury.[54] Prosecutors were reportedly examining whether the organization provided its outside accountants, Mazars USA, with cherry-picked information with which to prepare favorable financial statements to present to prospective lenders. Mazars provided disclaimers with its financial statements for the organization, indicating that the firm had not audited, reviewed, or given any assurances about them, and noting that ""Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.""[55] On February 9, 2022, Mazars informed the organization that it would no longer support the financial statements it had prepared for the organization from mid-2010 to mid-2020.[56]\n\nAlso on February 22, 2022, Bragg told two of his lead prosecutors, Mark F. Pomerantz and Carey R. Dunne, that he was not ready to indict Trump based on the difficulty of proving that he had criminal intent.[57] The two prosecutors resigned the following day,[58] with Pomerantz writing in his resignation letter that there is ""evidence sufficient to establish Mr. Trump\'s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt"" regarding ""numerous felony violations"" and that Vance had directed his deputies to seek indictments ""as soon as reasonably possible"".[59] The New York Times reported that the resignations followed a monthlong pause of evidence being presented to the jury, which was expected to remain seated until the end of April,[60][61] as well as discussions about charging Trump with conspiracy and falsifying financial records (instead of a fraud charge).[57] The most recent evidence heard was reportedly from Trump\'s Mazars accountant and an expert in real-estate property valuation from FTI Consulting.[60]\n\nOn February 24, Bragg recruited his investigations chief to the lead prosecutor role. The DA\'s office was expected to continue debating the strength of the case.[62][63] On April 7, Bragg issued a statement insisting that the investigation was still ongoing, with new evidence being reviewed, and pledged to make the findings public whether or not indictments were made.[64][65] Witnesses were still being interviewed as of late April, shortly before the jury expired.[61][66]\n\nAccording to Pomerantz\'s 2023 book on the investigation, racketeering charges were considered for Trump, with Pomerantz comparing the real-estate mogul to mob boss John Gotti. Trump\'s lawyer Joe Tacopina rejected the comparison.[67][d] Pomerantz also stated that ""To rebut the claim that Trump believed his own \'hype\'... we would have to show, and stress, that Donald Trump was not legally insane.""[69] According to Pomerantz, prosecutors were weeks away from charging Trump in late 2020 for the discrepancy in 40 Wall Street\'s valuation (with the ""absurd"" value reported to tax officials under penalty of perjury being less than the building\'s total annual rent), but the New York City Law Department downplayed this as a standard negotiating tactic.[70] Pomerantz compared Bragg\'s decision not to follow his predecessor\'s lead in prosecuting Trump to a plane crash. Bragg defended himself by stating that ""Mr. Pomerantz\'s plane wasn\'t ready for takeoff.""[71] Pomerantz further argued that if anyone else besides Trump or another former president had carried out the same conduct, charges would have immediately been brought against them.[72]\n\nHush money business records case\n\n[edit]\n\nThe People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump was a criminal case against Trump. On March 30, 2023, he was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury for his role in a scandal relating to hush money payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 U.S. presidential election,[73][74][75] making him the first U.S. president to be indicted.[e][77][78][79]\n\nOn April 4, 2023, he pleaded not guilty. The trial began in April 2024, and in May a jury convicted Trump on all 34 counts.[80] Sentencing was postponed until November 26, 2024. Trump faces a maximum sentence of 136 years in prison.[81][82][83][f]\n\nThroughout the investigation that led to the indictment, Trump accused district attorney Alvin Bragg—the case\'s prosecutor—of having political motivations.[85] Months before he was indicted, Trump declared that he would run in the 2024 presidential election.[86][87] The U.S. Constitution does not disqualify a convicted felon from being president.[88][89]\n\nCivil investigation\n\n[edit]\n\nNew York v. Trump is a civil investigation and lawsuit by the office of the New York Attorney General (AG) alleging that The Trump Organization and several individuals (including operative members of the Trump family) engaged in financial fraud by presenting vastly disparate property values to potential lenders and tax officials, in violation of New York Executive Law § 63(12). A trial took place from October 2023 to January 2024. As a result of the trial, the presiding judge Arthur Engoron ordered the defendants to disgorge a total of US$364 million of ill-gotten gains, among other penalties.\n\nAG Letitia James began investigating the organization in early 2019, with public litigation beginning in August 2020 to support her subpoenas in the inquiry. In February 2022, Engoron ruled in favor of James\'s subpoenas, and that April, Donald Trump was found in contempt of court for not complying with them and Trump was fined $110,000.\n\nIn September 2022, the AG sued Donald, his three oldest children (Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric), former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, former controller Jeffrey McConney, and ten related companies. That November, Engoron appointed retired judge Barbara S. Jones to monitor the organization regarding potential future fraud. In 2023, Ivanka was released as a defendant due to an expired statute of limitations.\n\nIn September 2023, Engoron issued a summary judgment that Trump and his company had committed fraud for years. The judge ordered the termination of the defendants\' state business licenses and the dissolution of pertinent limited liability companies (pending appeal). The trial covered six additional claims by the AG and considered further penalties. In October, a gag order was placed on Trump, forbidding him from publicly disparaging court staff; the judge fined Trump $5,000 and $10,000 for two violations of the order that same month. The defense unsuccessfully sought to dismiss the case, as well as related subpoenas and rulings.\n\nIn February 2024, Engoron concluded that the ""defendants failed to accept responsibility or to impose internal controls to prevent future recurrences"" of having ""submitted blatantly false financial data"" to ""borrow more and at lower rates"". Engoron assessed Donald Trump and his companies $354 million of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (not including interest), while Eric and Donald Jr. were assessed $4 million each, and Weisselberg $1 million. These four and McConney were also banned from leading New York organizations from two to three years; Weisselberg and McConney were also permanently banned from having any financial control in such organizations. The judgment was appealed.\n\nIn March 2024, the New York Appellate Division, First Department lowered the defendants\' required bond from $464 million to $175 million, which would be posted in early April, while staying the bans ordered by Engoron. The bond would later be approved on April 22, 2024.[90] This ruling which approved the bond also resulted in Trump avoiding legal challenges.[91]\n\nReactions\n\n[edit]\n\nSome commenters pointed out the irony of Donald Trump being faced with pleading the Fifth Amendment, which he has expressed disdain for doing, saying it implies a party\'s guilt.[92][93][g] In December 2020, Fox News host Sean Hannity stated that ""The president out the door needs to pardon his whole family and himself because they want this witch hunt to go on in perpetuity, they\'re so full of rage and insanity against the president.""[95] Some news outlets speculated that the president might preemptively pardon his children in connection with the criminal case, although the power only applies to federal crimes.[96] At a political rally on July 3, 2021, Trump appeared to acknowledge the truth of the New York prosecutors\' criminal charges against his company, then described filing taxes as generally confusing; journalist Andrew Feinberg referred to these statements as an ""admission"". A Slate writer compared Trump\'s alleged confusion about taxes to his prior self-proclaimed expertise, for example saying he was ""smart"" for not paying income tax during certain years while debating Hillary Clinton in 2016.[15][97]\n\nIn mid-2021, the Republican National Committee (RNC) agreed to financially support Trump\'s legal defense in both inquiries.[98] In October, it paid $121,670 to a law firm employed by Trump. The next month, a Republican (GOP) spokesperson called Trump ""a leader of our party [whose] record of achievement is critical to the GOP"" and referred to the investigations as a ""never ending witch hunt"" by Democrats.[99] In December, it was reported that the RNC had agreed to pay up to $1.6 million of Trump\'s legal expenses for both cases.[98] Some sources have pointed out that the matters being investigated took place prior to Trump becoming president.[99] Speaking to Hannity on Fox News in February 2022, Eric Trump argued that the investigations were only being conducted because his father was ""clearly the frontrunner for 2024"".[100] In early July 2022, the Washington Examiner reported that Trump was considering announcing his presidential run soon, apparently in order to increase his sway against the ""scathing hearings"" in the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[101] The RNC indicated that it would cut off legal funding for Trump as required if he officially announced his candidacy.[101][h] Later in July, Rolling Stone reported that Trump hoped to use the executive office to protect him from federal prosecution, but ""The law is less clear on whether a president can face prosecution from states while in office.""[103]\n\nIn January 2022, NBC News cited a criminal defense lawyer it employs as a legal analyst, who observed: ""Generally, lying to a bank to obtain a loan can be a crime.""[104] A New York defense lawyer who worked for Cyrus Vance Jr. called a potential trial against Trump a ""logistical nightmare"" and ""unprecedented in a courthouse that has seen many, many high-profile cases over the decades.""[105][i] The director of public information for New York\'s state courts points out that 4,000 court officers (with training similar to police) are employed to uphold public safety if necessary.[105] In the wake of the two lead prosecutors resigning from the criminal case, media outlets and a lawyer for Trump opined that the investigation seemed to be unwinding; some noted that while Vance had confidence in the criminal case, his successor, Bragg, exhibited less interest.[60][63][106] On April 25, Rise and Resist protesters gathered outside New York County Courthouse with a large sign reading ""Indict Trump"".[107] According to a legal expert cited by The Guardian in May, the nature of grand juries often favors the prosecution, with only a majority vote needed to secure an indictment, as well as ""legally sufficient evidence of a crime and ... reasonable cause to believe that the accused person committed that crime"".[108] On a July podcast with John C. Coffee, Pomerantz argued that Trump would have been charged if not for his ""financial and political influence"" and that such an outcome would ""vindicate the rule of law"".[109] In early 2023, Cohen opined that Bragg may not have followed in his predecessor\'s footsteps due to his need to catch up in his new role first.[110]\n\nIn early September, law professor Jessica Levinson stated on NPR that Trump\'s potential campaign for the 2024 presidential election ""will have no legal impact on any of the criminal investigations against him [but] will have a huge political impact"" regarding the rule of law and future elections.[111] On September 22, The Wall Street Journal editorial board—having written earlier in the year that the investigation ""looks like more evidence of the decline of America\'s rule of law""—stated that ""Trump has made a business and political career of getting away with whatever he can, and it\'s easy to imagine he crossed a line.""[112][113] Later in the month, a former assistant DA and asset forfeiture chief in the Manhattan DA\'s office argued, ""This is going to be a very difficult case for the defendants to win. One of the best defenses to this matter is to delay.""[114] New York Times columnist Gail Collins opined that Trump supporters would not be alienated by the former president\'s apparent fraud due to his already being well-known for distorting the truth.[115]\n\nA Curbed article from October about the state of Trump\'s real-estate empire in New York City concludes that ""In effect, his footprint in New York has already been shrinking for years, and James\'s lawsuit, while it may never come to fruition, has already laid that bare.""[116] Michael Cohen predicted that the lawsuit would ""financially destroy"" Trump and lead to his being perp walked.[117]\n\nOn November 4, 2022, citing McConney\'s stated involvement in providing fringe benefits, Andrea Bernstein stated on NPR that ""under New York law, the company is criminally liable if high managerial agents commit crimes.""[118] On November 14, CBS News cited a former employee of the organization\'s accounting department as saying that he knew about Allen and Barry Weisselberg\'s fringe benefits and that the former\'s propinquity with Trump was known within the department.[119] On November 15, New York Daily News asserted that the removal of Weisselberg\'s name from a copy of a page from Trump\'s ledger (provided to a New York City grand jury in 2021) might constitute obstruction of justice.[120] After the defense in the criminal trial rested its case, Reuters argued that the testimony of its witness Donald Bender ""appeared to backfire ... and bolster the prosecution\'s case"".[121]\n\nIn mid-November 2022, CBS News reported that three law firms involved in the criminal trial had received more than $500,000 from the Save America PAC and the RNC over the previous two months.[122] Some political experts have argued that the fallout of the criminal conviction would do little to damage Trump\'s political career due to his not being personally convicted.[123][j] Contrarily, some with inside knowledge of the investigations argue that Trump was personally implicated via the guilty verdict against his company, despite denials of wrongdoing made on his behalf.[125] An indictment or even a conviction would not constitutionally bar Trump from the presidential election.[126]\n\nIn February 2023, The New York Times reported that in 2021 and 2022, the Save America PAC spent $16 million in legal-related payments, some which were directed to firms representing Trump\'s company.[127]\n\nOn November 16, a New York appeals court ruled that Cohen could sue the organization to reimburse legal fees (in the range of millions of dollars) for Trump-related litigation including the investigations by the DA and AG.[128] After the organization\'s conviction in the criminal case, Cohen stated that Trump ""should be very uncomfortable"" regarding his own testimony to the DA\'s office.[129] Some speculated that the conviction would be highly damaging to the company\'s reputation, with a law professor at Pace University calling it a ""death knell"".[130][131] Bloomberg opined that the felony charges would be eclipsed by their impact.[132] New York City Councilmember Shekar Krishnan called for the city\'s parks department to terminate a golf-course contract with an organization affiliate (previously unsuccessfully attempted by former mayor Bill de Blasio in response to the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack), but a spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams pointed out that the affiliate itself was not convicted, so ""ending the contract we inherited would likely still require the city to pay up to tens of millions of dollars to the Trump affiliate"".[133][k] On January 1, 2023, an MSNBC opinion columnist cited the investigations amongst several others in arguing that Trump was likely to be charged that year.[135] Writing for New York Daily News, investigative journalist David Cay Johnston opined that Trump could be convicted on ""easy-to-prove state income tax fraud charges"" based on documents available to the DA\'s office, including Trump\'s publicly released tax returns which Johnston said were ""rich with what the IRS calls \'badges of fraud,\'"" such as ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in unexplained expenses"" on numerous Schedule C forms showing zero income and ""revenues and expenses that [suspiciously match] to the dollar"". Johnston pointed out that the former method was used by Trump in 1984 and (according to Johnston) found by New York judges to constitute civil tax fraud, which he argued that Trump undoubtedly knew before repeating 26 times, thus providing evidence of mens rea (knowledge of one\'s criminal intent).[136][l]\n\nThe Independent pointed out that hours after the organization was sentenced, Donald Trump Jr. made a social-media post ridiculing paying taxes, implying it supports foreign interests, namely Ukraine in its defense against Russian invasion.[137]\n\nSome political experts have argued that the fallout of the December 2022 criminal conviction would do little to damage Trump\'s political career due to his not being personally convicted.[124][m] Contrarily, some with inside knowledge of the investigations argue that Trump has been personally implicated via the guilty verdict against his company, despite denials of wrongdoing made on his behalf.[138]\n\nWriting for The New York Times, Maggie Haberman cited the investigations as being two of several against Trump highlighting his similar defensive tactics, summarized by former U.S. attorney and FBI official Chuck Rosenberg as being that ""he thinks that everything can be bought or fought.""[139]\n\nOn February 22, 2023, Forbes reported that ""new revelations about Trump Tower suggest that the building is—and always was—something of a fraud."" The article cites (1) ""Property records [showing] that [Trump] has been lying about the financial performance of the building since it first opened in 1983,"" (2) financial documents indicating that ""Trump lied about the square footage of the office and retail space at the base of the property"" (separate from the inflation of his penthouse), and (3) ""Portions of a [newly released] 2015 audio recording [which] prove that Trump was personally involved in the efforts to lie about the value of Trump Tower\'s commercial space"". Forbes concluded that ""The Trump Organization lied about the value of its properties to lenders for years, and although multiple people ... participated ... the person at the center of the deceit was Donald Trump.""[140]\n\nOn April 12, Trump sued Cohen for allegedly revealing his confidences and ""spreading falsehoods"" about him, citing the criminal case. Cohen\'s lawyer Lanny Davis argued that ""Trump appears once again to be using and abusing the judicial system as a form of harassment and intimidation,"" while Trump\'s lawyer Chris Kise argued that ""at some point someone needs to hold this serial liar [Cohen] accountable.""[141] However, on October 5, the charges were dropped ""without prejudice"" (reserving the right to reiterate them later).[142]\n\nHouse probe of Bragg\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 20, 2023, three House Republicans (Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, Oversight Committee Chair Jim Comer, and Administration Committee Chair Bryan Steil) sent Bragg a letter demanding documents and testimony related to the investigation. They called Trump\'s potential indictment ""an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority"" based on ""a novel legal theory"" including purportedly expired statutes of limitations,[143] saying the charge would ""erode confidence in the evenhanded application of justice and unalterably interfere in the ... 2024 presidential election"". They set a deadline of March 23 to discuss setting up a hearing before Congress they wanted Bragg to appear for.[144] Jordan defended Trump\'s alleged wrongdoing as a ""bookkeeping error""[145] and asserted that Bragg\'s office was subject to congressional oversight because it receives federal grants.[146] A DA spokesperson responded on March 20 that ""We will not be intimidated by attempts to undermine the justice process, nor will we let baseless accusations deter us from fairly applying the law.""[147][148] On March 23, a DA lawyer called the demand unprecedented and illegitimate, saying it was based on Trump\'s assertion he would be indicted on March 21 and arguing that compliance would reveal confidential information and interfere with the investigation.[149]\n\nThough Pomerantz said in March that he would not cooperate with the House probe,[150] on April 5, Jordan subpoenaed him for testimony about his resignation (initially scheduled for April 20);[151] Bragg denounced the effort as an ""attempt to undermine an active investigation"".[152] On April 11, Bragg sued Jordan over the House\'s efforts—calling them a ""transparent campaign to intimidate and attack"" his case as well as a ""fishing expedition""—seeking to block the subpoena of Pomerantz and requests for other confidential evidence. The same day, U.S. federal judge Mary Kay Vyskocil denied the DA\'s request for emergency relief.[150][n] On April 19, Vyskocil ruled that the subpoena of Pomerantz was valid on the basis that Congress was probing a legislative issue, namely the use of federal funding. Bragg\'s team argued that, though federal funds were used in the case against the organization, they were not used to indict Trump. A lawyer for Pomerantz said his client saw the subpoena as ""an improper attempt to obstruct and impede the pending prosecution"" of Trump. Vyskocil accused both sides of politically charged rhetoric and criticized Bragg\'s lawsuit of being excessively negative about Trump.[151][154][155] The same day, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted a temporary stay against the subpoena. Bragg and Pomerantz were given until April 21 to make further arguments,[155] but that day they recanted the appeal, agreeing that Pomerantz could be questioned on May 12 in the presence of their general counsel.[156] Pomerantz pleaded the Fifth in some of his answers that day.[157][158]\n\nJordan set a Judiciary Committee hearing about Bragg on April 17, broadly alleging that his ""pro-crime, anti-victim policies have led to an increase in violent crime"".[159][146] Mayor Adams and other city officials denounced the Judiciary Committee hearing, which Democrats painted as a Republican rouse against Bragg and C-SPAN opted not to televise.[146][o] Several witnesses were called, including individuals affected by actions of Bragg\'s they disagreed with.[146][160]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of lawsuits involving Donald Trump\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.courthousenews.com/final-witness-delivers-blistering-testimony-against-trump-in-civil-fraud-case/', 'Headline': 'Final witness delivers blistering testimony against Trump in civil ...', 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump, center, arrives at New York Supreme Court, Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, in New York.

I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nJudge interrupts Trump\'s ""irrelevant"" answer to questions about Scotland golf course valuation\n\nAs testimony began centering on the valuation of Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland — Trump lobbed an answer that Judge Arthur Engoron audibly deemed “irrelevant” to the question.\n\nThe New York assistant attorney general asked Trump if the description in his 2014 financial statement was accurate for the property — which followed by Trump touting Aberdeen as a oil capitol making the property more valuable.\n\n“Irrelevant, irrelevant, answer the question,” Engoron said speaking over Trump, one of the few times that’s happened since returning from the break.\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to boast about the course.\n\nAs Trump gave a long-winded answer about the beauty of the course, Engoron said he would be following the assistant attorney general’s lead: “If you want to let the witness ramble on, non responsive, repeat himself.”\n\nThe assistant attorney general was trying, unsuccessfully, to get Trump to acknowledge a discrepancy on the number of properties that could be built in Aberdeen.\n\n“It’s sort of like a painting. You can do pretty much what you want to do. The land is there and you can do what you want to do,” Trump said.\n\nTrump questioned about the value of Mar-a-Lago\n\nDonald Trump says he believes Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\n“You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” asked Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nThe valuation of Mar-a-Lago has been one of Trump’s complaints about the judge in the trial, after the judge cited a Florida tax appraisal of $18 million for the property in his decision finding Trump, his adult sons and his company committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nWallace asked Trump if he approved of valuing Mar-a-Lago as if it would be sold to an individual as a resident. “Did I approve it on this? I don’t know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump replied, “I don’t remember that, no” when asked if he explicitly told former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg or former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney to value the property that way.\n\nWallace confronted Trump with a 2002 deed of development rights that shows Trump deeded away his right to use the property as anything other than a social club.\n\nTrump then gave a long aside about Mar-a-Lago when Wallace asked him about not being able to use it as anything but a social club.\n\n“I don’t mind leaving it as a club. In fact, if somebody wanted it, smartest thing to do, have a club and have one member and that would be the member that lives in the club. But it’s much more valuable — and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes — that its biggest value is using it as a club,” Trump said.\n\nWallace showed Trump a 2003 article in which the former president told a reporter Mar-A-Lago will always be a club.\n\n“I think that was said with bravado more than legal intent,” Trump said on the stand.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nWhat the scene is like inside the courtroom as Trump takes the stand\n\nIt was an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump took the witness stand a bit ago in New York. The former president slowly climbed a couple of steps into the box and raised his hand to take the oath.\n\nFormer presidents are typically surrounded by a force-field of deference, due to their status and are accompanied everywhere by Secret Service agents.\n\nBut Trump, in a blue suit, shirt and blue tie rather than his typical campaign uniform of white shirt and red tie, is sitting in the witness box alone in a leather chair, with wood panels on either side. His hands are clasped in his lap, and a large bottle of water and two smaller ones are to his left beside a screen allowing him to see court documents.\n\nThis is a civil trial rather than a criminal one. And the American people can’t see it because it’s not televised. But this the moment when the reality of the 2024 campaign hit home. Trump is simultaneously a multiple defendant, as well as being the Republican front-runner and potential next US president.\n\nThis is the most extraordinary campaign in modern history in microcosm.\n\nTrump says he would on occasion make suggestions on financial docs at heart of the trial\n\nFurther questioning in today’s civil fraud trial turned toward the financial documents at the heart of the trial, with Donald Trump saying he would look at financial statements, and on occasion make suggestions.\n\nTrump says of his statements of financial condition, “I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions.”\n\nThe former president says that bankers didn’t pay much attention to his financial statements, and says that is going to be part of their defense.\n\n“We’ll explain that as this trial goes along. This crazy trial goes along. Because we’re bringing in the bankers. Very big bankers,” Trump says. “They will explain exactly what their process is.”\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to. They looked at the deal,” he testified.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump arrives to court ahead of testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has arrived at a New York courthouse to face questions in the $250 million civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nJudge overseeing Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order on Friday\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order in the trial to extend to Trump’s attorneys after they raised multiple questions about the judge’s communications with his law clerk.\n\nIn a written order Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron prohibited Trump’s attorneys from making any further comments about confidential communications between the judge and his staff inside or outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe judge said violating the order would result in “serious sanctions.”\n\nAnalysis: Trump heads to the witness stand as the latest polls show him leaping past Biden in key swing states\n\nA year away from Election Day 2024, former President Donald Trump is set to testify in a civil fraud trial and separately faces more than 90 criminal charges, setting up the possibility that a convicted felon tops the Republican ticket next November.\n\nBut it’s President Joe Biden’s political prospects that are plunging.\n\nIn another extraordinary twist to a 2024 campaign season that is more notable for court hearings than treks through early voting states, Trump is expected to be called to the witness stand in New York on Monday. This is hardly typical activity during a post-presidency. But Trump was, after all, the most unconventional president.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is absorbing brutal new polls showing him losing to GOP front-runner Trump in multiple key swing states. The numbers will likely ignite panic among Democrats and renew doubts among Americans that the soon-to-be-81-year-old is up to a full second term. If the New York Times/Siena College survey is borne out in 2024, there would be no electoral path to victory for Biden. And an increasingly authoritarian Trump – who is promising a second term of “retribution” – could pull off a White House comeback in spite of sparking a Capitol insurrection with his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020.\n\n“I was concerned before these polls, and I’m concerned now,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“These presidential races over the last couple of terms have been very tight. No one is going to have a runaway election here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, concentration, resources. And so we have our work cut out for us.”\n\nThe coinciding crises facing both Trump and Biden belie the fact that, for all their deficiencies, neither is yet to face a serious challenger from within their parties as they seek the nomination.\n\nBiden’s position is weakening as he tackles cascading global threats such as the war in the Middle East, sheds support over his handling of the economy and sees cracks in the multiracial coalition that first elected him. It also reflects a nation that is divided and disconsolate, and groping for the elusive normality that the president promised three years ago after the pandemic and the historic turbulence of the Trump administration.\n\nKeep reading here.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/11/07/1211133180/trump-spars-with-new-york-judge-as-he-testifies-in-civil-fraud-trial', 'Headline': 'Trump spars with New York judge as he testifies in civil fraud trial - NPR', 'Snippet': 'Trump spars with New York judge as he testifies in civil fraud trial Things got testy Monday when former President Donald Trump took the witness stand in his civil fraud trial in New York. Trump ...', 'Full_text': 'MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took the witness stand yesterday at a New York courthouse. He was there to answer questions related to fraudulent financial statements made by the Trump Organization, statements that were used to secure business and credit deals with banks and also to measure Trump\'s net worth. New York\'s attorney general is accusing Trump, along with several associates, of knowingly committing fraud by inflating the value of these assets. NPR\'s Ximena Bustillo was in the courthouse, and she\'s with us now to tell us what she saw. Good morning.\n\nXIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nMARTIN: Ximena, we keep hearing how it got pretty testy in there. What can you tell us about that?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, it didn\'t take long for the pair to clash. This is not the first time that they met face to face. Trump has come to multiple days of this trial, even though he\'s not required to. And don\'t forget that he was called up to the witness stand once before by Judge Arthur Engoron himself to answer questions about comments he made that violated a gag order. Now, yesterday during the first hour, there were some tense exchanges between the judge and Trump\'s legal team, Engoron at one point beseeching the Trump team to, quote, ""control him."" And that was his word, beseeching.\n\nAnd he felt Trump was going on long speeches, and some that included tangents about his properties and political success or how he thought the judge was politically motivated. Engoron seemed to have no patience for this and even went as far as to remind Trump that this is not a political rally. Still, though, Trump called the state attorney general a political hack and doubled down on many of the personal insults that he\'s been leaning on since the start of this trial. Trump\'s team also argued that the nature of this case, being that Trump is a frontrunner for the GOP nomination and there is no jury, should warrant longer answers than perhaps the judge wants.\n\nMARTIN: Speaking of those facts, let\'s just recap those briefly. New York Attorney General Letitia James says Trump was part of an effort to inflate and sometimes deflate the value of Trump Organization assets to get better deals. Trump and his co-defendants have actually already been found liable for fraud, so this trial will decide the potential punishment. James wants them banned from doing business in the state and $250 million in penalties. So what further arguments has the prosecution made?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, the attorney general\'s team has brought up various witnesses who worked within the Trump Organization and the accounting firm Mazars to generally ask about how these documents were created. And this includes the literal math - we\'ve been staring at a ton of spreadsheets - but also the hierarchy and power influence that higher-ranking Trump Organization executives, such as Donald Trump, may have had.\n\nUltimately, the executives of the Trump Organization, including Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., signed off on these statements that have already been found to be fraudulent and may have been responsible for them, even if they didn\'t do the number crunching themselves. Still, though, some witnesses have testified that Trump did want the numbers to be higher for certain perks, like landing on the Forbes Top 100 list.\n\nMARTIN: So we heard two of the president\'s sons, Eric and Don Jr., testify last week. His daughter, Ivanka Trump, is due to take the witness stand tomorrow. What can we expect to hear from her?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, Ivanka is the last witness that the attorney general\'s team is putting forward. And unlike her brothers, she is not a defendant. Her attorney successfully argued that any related actions Ivanka had at the Trump Organization happened before the statute of limitations kicked in. But the attorney general\'s team plans to rest their case after that, and then the Trump team will begin to lay out their case the following week.\n\nMARTIN: That is NPR\'s Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thank you.\n\nBUSTILLO: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF L\'ECLAIR\'S ""TAISHI-KOTO, PT. 1"")\n\nCopyright © 2023 NPR. All rights reserved.

Attorneys for both sides need to be inclusive on their witness lists of any potential person they might want to call, or the judge could exclude the testimony.\n\nTrump previously sat for a deposition in the case and said he had little “if any” role in preparing the financial statements that a New York judge ruled earlier this week were fraudulent.\n\nAlso on both lists are Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who are both defendants in the case, and numerous current and former Trump Organization employees, including former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Most of the witnesses have also testified in videotaped depositions.\n\nIn civil cases, defendants can be called to testify and if they refuse, the jury, or in this case Judge Arthur Engoron, can use that against them in weighing the evidence.\n\nThe New York attorney general’s office identified 28 witnesses they could call in the case, including Michael Cohen and Ivanka Trump. Ivanka Trump was initially a defendant in the case, but a New York appeals court struck her from the lawsuit saying the claims brought against her were too old.\n\nTrump’s attorneys identified 127 possible witnesses that they would call, including some of the lenders behind the loans at issue in the lawsuit.\n\nThe case is scheduled to start Monday. Engoron will decide how much money the Trumps would pay the state after finding the former president and his business engaged in a persistent fraud by using inflated financial statements for nearly a decade.\n\nThe state is also seeking to prove the Trumps engaged in insurance fraud and falsified business records. Engoron has set aside nearly three months for the trial.\n\nAn appeals court ruling is expected as soon as Thursday that could potentially impact the trial start date.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/66989373', 'Headline': ""Fact-checking Trump's claims about New York fraud trial - BBC"", 'Snippet': 'Trump walks out of the New York courtroom during a break in the first day of the trial on whether he committed fraud. Donald Trump made a passionate opening statement, of sorts, on the first day ...', 'Full_text': 'Donald Trump made a passionate opening statement, of sorts, on the first day of his fraud trial in New York.\n\nThe former president was not giving evidence - instead, he stopped just outside the courtroom to address reporters before the historic hearing began.\n\nAfter a few stern looks at the camera, he launched into a lengthy preview of what his lawyers are expected to argue during the civil case again him, his two adult sons and the Trump Organization.\n\nHe also lobbed accusations against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the fraud charges and is seeking a fine of $250m (£207m), and Judge Arthur Engoron who already ruled last week that Mr Trump and his business had committed fraud.\n\nLet\'s take a closer look at seven of Mr Trump\'s claims.\n\n1. There were no victims\n\nThis is very important to Mr Trump. He believes there should be no case because ""there was no crime"".\n\n""No bank was affected. No bank was hurt,"" he said moments before the start of the trial, noting that all his loans were paid back on time.\n\nUnder this New York statute, however, the attorney general did not have to show that there were victims, only that Mr Trump committed ongoing fraud.\n\n2. The case was timed to damage Trump\'s 2024 campaign\n\n""This trial was railroaded and fast-tracked,"" the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination said. ""This trial could have been brought years ago, but they waited until I was right in the middle of my campaign.""\n\nMr Trump has cast this trial, as well as other lawsuits and indictments, as an attempt to hurt his bid to return to the White House next year.\n\nBut the investigation into these fraud claims began four and a half years ago, when Trump was still president, after his former fixer Michael Cohen went public with the Trump Organization\'s accounting practices.\n\nJudge Engoron reminded Mr Trump\'s lawyer on Monday that the judge has already dismissed claims the lawsuit was politically motivated.\n\n3. Trump was denied a jury\n\nAfter the judge\'s ruling last week, Mr Trump made this claim in a social media post, suggesting to supporters that he had been denied a trial and a jury, and therefore robbed of justice.\n\nOn Monday in court, the judge made a point to say that ""nobody asked"" for a jury trial.\n\nBench trials are not unheard of, and it means the judge alone will decide liability and penalties in the remaining six claims.\n\n4. The \'corrupt\' justice department is behind this\n\nTo fit the case into his wider ""witch hunt"" rhetoric, Mr Trump claimed that Ms James was corrupt, and that she was coordinating with and taking orders from the US Department of Justice.\n\n""It\'s all run by DOJ, which is corrupt, in Washington - everything goes through them,"" he alleged.\n\nHe has shown no evidence of coordination. Also, this is a civil fraud case based on New York state laws, not a federal one. The Justice Department has no jurisdiction here.\n\n5. The \'buyer beware clause\' renders contracts useless\n\nMr Trump pushed this rather unorthodox argument while speaking to reporters on Monday. His businesses\' financial statements have a clause that Mr Trump calls a ""buyer beware"" warning, a disclaimer he said means ""do not believe anything"".\n\nMr Trump says that putting a ""full disclaimer"" in financial statements, ""immediately takes you out of any fraud situation and any litigation"".\n\nBut the judge was clear in his ruling last week that these are non-party disclaimers from his former accounting firm Mazars, and that they do not insulate him from liability.\n\nThose disclaimers also plainly state that ""Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement…""\n\n6. The judge undervalued Trump properties\n\nIn an unusual step, the judge has already ruled that Trump properties were worth less than the former president and his company stated. That was part of a summary judgement delivered last week.\n\n""What he did - undervaluing these properties - is a disgrace to our nation,"" Mr Trump said on Monday.\n\nHowever, it was not Judge Engoron who came up with the valuations. The ones he cited in his ruling were from official assessors.\n\nTake Mar-a-Lago, for example, the former president\'s Florida resort. It was the Palm Beach County assessor - not the judge - that appraised the market value of Trump\'s primary residence at between $18m-$27.6m (£14.5m-£22.5m).\n\nMr Trump continues to claim it is probably worth 50 to 100 times more.\n\n7. Trump did not include his brand in his valuations\n\nMr Trump is not usually shy about telling the world how much his brand is worth.\n\nIn his comments before the trial, however, Mr Trump insisted it had not been factored into the valuations of various properties that are at the heart of this fraud case.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-fraud-trial-new-york-10-02-23/index.html', 'Headline': 'October 2, 2023 - Trump civil fraud trial in New York begins', 'Snippet': 'The New York attorney general’s first witness, Trump’s long-time accountant Donald Bender, testified about financial documents from 2011, including discrepancies in the price of Ivanka Trump ...', 'Full_text': 'Fact check: Trump’s inaccurate comments about a ""worthless clause""\n\nIn comments to reporters before the Monday hearing, Trump spoke at length about what he called a “worthless clause” disclaimer in the financial statements that are at issue in the trial.\n\nTrump said, “We have a clause in the contract, it’s like a buyer beware clause. It says, ‘When you take a look at the financial statement, don’t believe anything you read’ — this is up front. ‘Don’t believe anything you read.’ Some people call it a ‘worthless clause,’ because it makes the statement, and anything you read in the statement, worthless. It says, ‘Go out and do your own research, go out and do your own due diligence, you have to study the statement carefully. Do not believe anything.’”\n\nHe said moments later that the clause “immediately takes you out of any fraud situation and any litigation.”\n\nFacts First: Trump inaccurately described this clause, as Judge Arthur Engoron noted in a ruling last week in which he found Trump liable for fraud. The clause does not say “don’t believe anything you read,” its actual language is significantly softer than Trump claimed. And there is no apparent basis for Trump’s suggestion that the clause inoculates him against any litigation at all.\n\nEngoron wrote last week that “the ‘worthless clause’ does not say what defendants say it says, does not rise to the level of an enforceable disclaimer, and cannot be used to insulate fraud as to facts peculiarly within defendants’ knowledge, even vis-à-vis sophisticated recipients.”\n\nHe also wrote that “a defendant may not rely on a disclaimer for misrepresentation of facts peculiarly within the defendant’s knowledge” — and that “defendants’ reliance on these ‘worthless’ disclaimers is worthless.”\n\nHere’s the text of the clause:\n\nThere is certainly language in the clause that suggests that readers of the financial statements should use caution in relying on the listed asset valuations. But the clause doesn’t say the valuations are entirely worthless and does not tell readers that they should simply not believe anything they read in the statements. Rather, it suggests there had been a good-faith effort to value the assets using a variety of reasonable methods.\n\n“You can read it up and down; it doesn’t say, ‘I will lie to you, I will double or triple the value of these things — my statements in here are outright lies,’” CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen said last week.\n\nJudge asks whether testimony about 2011 documents was a ""waste of time""\n\nThe judge in former President Donald Trump’s civil trial Monday questioned whether lengthy witness testimony about 2011 financial documents was a “waste of time” because of statute of limitations applying to the case expired in 2014.\n\nAt the end of Monday’s court session, Judge Arthur Engoron responded to testimony from former Mazars account Donald Bender about the 2011 financial documents, acknowledging that a state appellate court had ruled the statute of limitations only allowed allegations from 2014 onward to apply in the case.\n\nThe defense agreed with Engoron’s assertion, prompting Trump to give a thumbs up.\n\nThe judge’s comment marked a small win for Trump because it showed the judge again recognizing the statute of limitations that had been decided by the appeals court.\n\nAt the same time, however, Engoron did allow the witness testimony about the 2011 financial documents on Monday over the objection of Trump’s attorneys, as the attorney general’s office indicated it would connect the testimony to allegations that fall within the statute of limitations.\n\nBender is returning for a second day of testimony on Tuesday.\n\nIn his ruling last week, Engoron wrote that the fraudulent statements of financial condition were still relevant in the case even if they’re for transactions completed before 2014 because they were submitted within the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nThe judge wrote that the attorney general’s office was not “challenging the loans, the closings, or the disbursements,” but was challenging the financial documents containing false and misleading information.\n\nMonday’s comments addressing admissible evidence do not indicate that Engoron will change that ruling.\n\nTrump\'s motorcade returns to Trump Tower after he attended first day of civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has returned to Trump Tower after spending the day attending his civil fraud trial in New York.\n\nThe trial is expected to last until December 22, according to Judge Arthur Engoron.\n\nAsked if he would return to court on Tuesday, Trump told reporters while leaving court for the day: “We may, I’d love not to. I’d love to be campaigning instead of doing this.”\n\nCivil fraud trial “took me off the campaign trail,"" Trump claims\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed that Monday’s civil fraud trial in New York took him “off the campaign trail” and cast the trial as a political attack against him.\n\nTrump was not required to attend the trial, which is a civil action — not a criminal case.\n\nDespite that the former president attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James’ $250 million lawsuit against him in the same manner that he has railed against the criminal charges he’s facing in four other jurisdictions.\n\nAsked whether he was returning for the trial on Tuesday, Trump said: “We may, I’d love not to. I’d love to be campaigning instead of doing this.”\n\nFact check: Trump baselessly claims federal Justice Department is behind New York civil fraud trial\n\nIn comments to reporters before Monday’s hearing, former President Donald Trump baselessly claimed that the federal Justice Department orchestrated the New York state civil fraud case and other cases against him.\n\n“It all comes down from the DOJ. They totally coordinate this in Washington,” Trump said. He added later in his remarks, “It’s all run by DOJ, which is corrupt, in Washington. Everything goes through them.”\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence that the Justice Department directed anyone to bring this state civil fraud case. The trial that began Monday stemmed from a lawsuit filed in 2022 by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who quickly began investigating Trump’s company upon being sworn in at the beginning of 2019 – when Trump still had two full years left in his presidency. Trump has correctly noted that James, a Democrat, herself ran on a campaign platform that included a vow to take on Trump.\n\nTrump also said in his Monday comments that “this trial could’ve been brought years ago, but they waited ‘til I was right in the middle of my campaign; the same with other trials and indictments.”\n\nIt’s true that a previous New York attorney general could conceivably have pursued the same case years ago, since the allegations pertain to conduct dating back more than a decade — but James brought the case in September 2022, roughly two months before Trump launched his 2024 campaign in November 2022.\n\nTrump faces two federal criminal cases that were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland; it’s fair to argue that the Justice Department is behind those cases.\n\nBut Trump has also baselessly alleged that the Justice Department is responsible for two criminal cases brought against him by local district attorneys in Manhattan, New York, and Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nTrump says he attended the civil trial because he wanted ""to watch this witch hunt"" himself\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he attended the civil fraud trial against him that began Monday in New York so he could “watch this witch hunt myself.”\n\nTrump was not required to appear in court Monday for the trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives. But he chose to attend and sit in the Manhattan courtroom – while giving multiple statements attacking the proceedings as he entered and exited.\n\nHe continued to rail against Arthur Engoron, the judge overseeing his civil trial, saying he should be disbarred after he ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case.\n\nTrump criticizes judge overseeing civil fraud case\n\nFormer President Donald Trump attacked Arthur Engoron, the judge overseeing his civil case, as he left the courtroom during a lunch break following opening statements this morning.\n\nTrump called Engoron a Democrat and “an operative,” saying that the case against him was a “disgrace.” He also attacked the New York Attorney General Letitia James for going after him instead of violent crime.\n\n“We’re going to be here for months with a judge that already made up his mind. It’s ridiculous,” Trump said.\n\n“They waste their time with this, with banks that were very happy that got all their money back. They weren’t defrauded. I’ve been defrauded,” Trump said.\n\nAsked if he was coming back to the courtroom after lunch, Trump said, “probably.”\n\nEngoron ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case, one of the seven claims that are a part of the lawsuit.\n\nWatching Trump\'s body language in court\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has not expressed much emotion in the courtroom for the first session of the criminal fraud trial.\n\nDuring the four opening statements, Trump sat at the defense table between two of his lawyers. He never spoke to the judge. Trump often faced forward, watching the small video monitor in front of him which displayed the opening presentations by the state and his defense lawyer.\n\nWhen Alina Habba and Cliff Robert, who are lawyers for Trump’s co-defendants, spoke without video presentations, Trump looked at them intently. Habba, who represents Allen Weiselberg, Jeff McConney and other employees of the Trump Organization, at times turned to Trump when she was discussing the valuation of his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nAs Trump’s lawyer, Christopher Kise, answered questions from the judge, Trump wrote notes and passed them to him. Eric Trump, who is also a defendant, sat in the front row of the courtroom gallery, on the defense side behind and to his father’s left. New York State Attorney General Letitia James sat in the front row on the other side of the courtroom, behind the former president and about 15 feet to his right.\n\nTrump only once looked at James, as he left the courtroom for the lunch break, turning his head as he walked past where she was seated. Eric Trump stopped and shook her hands using both of his hands as he followed his father out of the courtroom.\n\nJudge pushes back after Trump lawyer attacks New York attorney general in opening statement\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron rebutted attacks from Donald Trump’s attorney Alina Habba against New York Attorney General Letitia James, responding to her opening statement and getting into a debate with the attorney over her claims.\n\nIn her statement, Habba attacked James for saying in her campaign for attorney general that she was going to “get Trump.”\n\nEngoron, who ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case against Trump, responded by noting that the defense already tried to dismiss the case claiming that James brought it as a “witch hunt” against Trump.\n\nTrump intently watched Habba as she sparred with the judge.\n\n“These statements of financial condition were current, current market value. The point is what were they worth then,” Engoron said, pushing back on Habba’s assertion that the inflated values showed what they could be sold for at some point in the future.\n\nAn accounting disclaimer from Mazars, Trump’s former accounting firm, essentially said, “We’re relying on the Trump Organization,” Engoron said. “That’s how I read it.”\n\n“No, your honor,” Habba responded, arguing that the Trump Organization relied on Mazars and “they’re the accountants.”\n\nTrump lawyer claims Mar-a-Lago would sell for $1 billion in opening statement\n\nAlina Habba, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, Allen Weisselberg, former Trump Organization chief financial officer, and other Trump Organization employees, delivered an opening statement in court Monday attacking New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nHabba’s comments echoed Trump — who has tried to tie the civil case against him in New York as an effort to attack him and his presidential campaign.\n\n“Ms. James said she was going to come into office and ‘get Trump,’” Habba said, claiming that the case could have been brought three years ago before she took office.\n\nHabba also criticized the valuations the judge gave for properties like Mar-a-Lago, which the judge valued at $18 million in his ruling last week, finding Trump and his co-defendants liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nHabba argued that if Trump was trying to show a higher net worth, he would have included things like the rights to “The Apprentice” and the Trump brand.\n\n“There would have been the brand, the same brand that got that man elected for president,” she said. “There’s a lot of people in this room that probably don’t like that and that’s why we’re here.”\n\nTrump was looking at Habba as she spoke in the courtroom.\n\nFact check: The Trump campaign leaves out this year\'s crime declines while attacking Letitia James\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign deployed out-of-date crime data about New York City in a Monday attack on state Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the lawsuit in which the former president is now facing a civil fraud trial for inflating asset valuations on financial statements.\n\nIn a news release the campaign distributed shortly before Trump appeared in a New York courtroom for the start of the trial, the former president’s campaign delivered a variety of attacks against James — one of them pointing out that she received a campaign donation from liberal billionaire George Soros, a Jewish philanthropist and Democratic donor who has been a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories baselessly depicting him as a puppet master behind various domestic and international events.\n\nThe Trump campaign concluded the Monday release by claiming that New York crime has “skyrocketed” under James, who took office in 2019. But the campaign repeatedly used crime data from 2021 or 2022 even though more recent data is available — making the crime picture look worse than it is, since the situation with some major crime categories has improved markedly this year and last.\n\nFor example, the Trump campaign said, “In New York City, shootings increased by 71% from 2018 to 2022.”\n\nWhile that’s accurate, the campaign didn’t mention that the number of shootings in the city has plummeted by about 27% so far in 2023 compared to the same point in 2022 — after also falling about 17% for the full year of 2022 compared to the full year of 2021.\n\nIn other words, the Trump campaign didn’t explain that New York City is now well into a second straight year with an improving shootings trendline, and, if current trends roughly hold for the rest of the year, that 2023 will end with a much less than 71% increase over the number of shootings compared to 2018.\n\nSimilarly, the Trump campaign said, “Murders increased by 48% from 2018 to 2022 in New York City.” The Trump campaign didn’t mention that the number of murders in the city declined by about 10% in 2022 and has fallen by about 11% so far in 2023 compared to the same point in 2022. Again, the trendline is well into a second year of significant improvement.\n\nAnd the numbers aside, it’s also highly questionable at best to blame or credit an individual attorney general for the crime situation in their state.\n\nThe number of murders spiked around the country beginning in 2020, when there was widespread economic and social upheaval because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and has improved around the country in 2022 and 2023 — complicating attempts to assign blame for the increases or credit for the decreases to any particular state or local official.\n\nIn addition, the precise causes of crime fluctuations are difficult to pinpoint even decades after the fact; they are affected by numerous factors, from the economy to government policy to sociocultural factors to policing strategies to the corrections system.\n\nTrump posts clips of New York attorney general talking about suing the former president\n\nVideos of New York Attorney General Letitia James talking about suing Donald Trump were being posted on the former president’s social media account while he sat inside a Manhattan courtroom for the civil fraud trial that James brought against him.\n\nTrump is arguing that the case, which began Monday, is politically motivated.\n\nIn one video, James can be heard saying, “Oh we’re going to definitely sue him. We’re going to be a real pain in the ass.”\n\nIn another clip, she says, “What is fueling my soul right now is Trump.”\n\nThe videos are posted on social media platform Truth Social.\n\n“New York embarrassment Letitia James is politically targeting President Trump,” the text in one video reads. “Letitia James is abusing her office.”\n\nTrump\'s lawyer: ""He has made a fortune literally about being right about real estate""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s attorney Chris Kise began his opening statement with an understatement, saying their team has a “very different picture of the evidence.”\n\nKise said the former president’s real estate knowledge made him a billionaire.\n\nTrump continues to look ahead at the monitor displaying his organization’s loan agreements, and occasionally leaning over talking to his lawyer.\n\n“There may be wide variations between different valuations” of certain parts of the Trump Org.’s real estate portfolio, Kise said, but added the evidence at trial will show the asset valuations on Trump’s statements of financial condition comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nIn pictures: Trump in court for civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is at a New York City courthouse Monday for the start of a civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nLast week, a state Supreme Court judge found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The ruling was a significant victory for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a $250 million lawsuit last year alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nSee photos from inside and around the courthouse today:\n\nTrump claims civil fraud case is part of ""election interference"" against him\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed before walking into court Monday that the New York Attorney General’s civil case against him was part of an attempt to harm his campaign.\n\n“This has to do with election interference, plain and simple,” Trump said. “They’re trying to damage me, so I don’t do as well as I’m doing in the election.”\n\nTrump’s claims about election interference are the same attacks he’s made against all four of the criminal indictments against him.\n\nBefore entering the New York courtroom Monday, Trump attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, as well as Manhattan District Attorney General Alvin Bragg and the Justice Department, linking the civil action against him in New York with his criminal indictments, even though they are not related.\n\nTrump is surrounded by his attorneys in the courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is seated in a New York City courtroom flanked by his attorneys on each side of him.\n\nHis son Eric Trump is seated in the front row of the gallery on the defense side.\n\nThere are at least nine court officers in the room.\n\nTrump didn\'t look at Attorney General Letitia James as he entered the court\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is seated in the front row of the courtroom, on the prosecution’s side and next to one of the aisles.\n\nAfter speaking with reporters in the hallway and calling James a “racist,” Trump entered the courtroom through the main doors about 15 feet to her right. The former president walked directly in front of her and did not appear to look in her direction.\n\nHe is sitting with his attorneys Christopher Kise and Alina Habba.\n\nTrump calls the civil fraud trial ""a scam"" and ""a sham""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said Monday that the civil fraud trial against him and his associates that is set to begin soon is a “continuation of the single greatest witch hunt of all time.”\n\nHe made the comments as he made his way to the courtroom where the trial will begin.\n\nTrump went on to attack Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James, saying “she was going to ‘get Trump’ before she even knew anything about me.”\n\n“She used this to run for governor. She failed in her attempt to run for governor,” he said. “She had virtually no following. She came back and she said, ‘well, now I will go back to get Trump again.’ And this what we have. It is a scam and a sham.”\n\nTrump added that his financial statements “are phenomenal,” and claimed, “no bank was affected, no bank was hurt.”\n\nDonald Trump appears in courthouse hallway\n\nDonald Trump walked through the hallway in court ahead of his civil fraud trial. He is talking to reporters right now.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court gives one win to Trump today\n\nThere have been a smattering of attempts to remove Donald Trump from the ballot next year based on his alleged role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court said it won’t take up one of those longshot challenges, rejecting an appeal from John Anthony Castro, a little-known candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nCastro’s case against Trump leans on a post-Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment that says any American official who takes an oath to uphold the US Constitution is disqualified from holding future office if they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” or have “given aid or comfort” to insurrectionists.\n\nThe case was denied without any comment or recorded vote.\n\nThere are still 14th Amendment challenges against Trump in Minnesota and Colorado, which are scheduled for trials later this year.\n\nEric Trump arrives at court\n\nDonald Trump’s son, Eric Trump, has arrived at the New York City court ahead of the civil fraud trial against the former president, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nThe civil trial over inflated assets in fraudulent financial statements come less than a week after a ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron that found Trump and his co-defendants are liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nNew York attorney general: ""No matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law""\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said in a short statement Monday morning, “My message is simple: No matter how powerful you are, no matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law.”\n\nThe attorney general noted that last week, a state Supreme Court judge found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The trial that begins today will determine the amount of damages owed.\n\nWatch the moment here:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n980b6c7f-2a43-4e1c-8c67-e5eeeb5f987e.mp4\n\n00:44 - Source: CNN\n\nHere\'s what it\'s like inside the court where Trump\'s civil trial will play out\n\nThe civil fraud trial that former President Donald Trump will attend today is in the large third floor courtroom: room 300 of the 60 Centre Street building.\n\nPaintings on the wall depict the early courts of New York City, including the popular law courts of New Netherlands in the 1600s.\n\nThere are various computer display screens arranged for the parties, and two large screens for the court and the gallery.\n\nThere are nine rows of wood benches, with two aisles and some chairs on the side. Altogether, available seating exceeds 100 people.\n\nPeople are still arriving.\n\nTrump heads to court for first day of civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump departed from Trump Tower and is en route to a New York City courthouse to attend the first day of the civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nMore on the trial: Opening statements in the trial over inflated assets will begin today. The trial comes less than a week after a ruling that found Trump and his co-defendants liable for “repeated” fraud.\n\nThe former president, his adult children and his closest business advisers are all listed as potential witnesses for both the New York attorney general and the defense. Being listed as a potential witness, however, does not mean they will be called to testify.\n\nDonald Trump and his adult children on witness lists in New York civil fraud case\n\nDonald Trump, his adult children, and his closest business advisors could be called to testify during the civil fraud trial expected to begin Monday in New York.\n\nTrump is listed on the witness lists submitted by the New York Attorney General and Trump’s legal team. The state and Trump’s lawyers need to be inclusive on their witness lists of any potential person they might want to call, or the judge could exclude the testimony.\n\nTrump previously sat for a deposition in the case and said he had little “if any” role in preparing the financial statements that a New York judge ruled last week were fraudulent.\n\nAlso on both lists are Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, defendants in the case and numerous current and former Trump Organization employees, including former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Most of the witnesses have also testified in video depositions\n\nIn civil cases defendants can be called to testify and, if they refuse the jury, or in this case the judge, can use that against them in weighing the evidence.\n\nThe New York attorney general’s office identified 28 witnesses they could call in the case, including Michael Cohen and Ivanka Trump. Ivanka Trump was initially a defendant in the case, but a New York appeals court struck her from the lawsuit saying the claims brought against her were too old.\n\nTrump’s attorneys identified 127 possible witnesses that they would call, including some of the lenders behind the loans at issue in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial begins today. Here\'s what to know\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will be in attendance Monday in a New York courtroom for the start of the civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nOpening statements in the civil trial over inflated assets in fraudulent financial statements come less than a week after a shocking ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron that found Trump and his co-defendants are liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nThe ruling was a significant victory for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the $250 million lawsuit last September alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nTrump inflated his net worth by as much as $3.6 billion in three separate years between 2011 and 2021, according to the attorney general’s office. Attorneys for Trump have refuted the claims, arguing that asset valuations are highly subjective and that they are still sorting through what the ruling means for the company’s future.\n\nWhat’s at stake at trial: Trump and his companies could be forced to pay hefty sums in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through their fraudulent business practices.\n\nEngoron will consider just how much the Trumps and their businesses will have to pay.\n\nThe judge is expected to consider claims of business records fraud and insurance fraud alleged in the lawsuit in connection to high-profile properties, though he already determined some broad level of fraud was perpetuated.\n\nThe six causes of action are falsifying business records, conspiracy to falsify business records, issuing false financial statements, conspiracy to falsify false financial statements, insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.\n\nJames’ lawsuit also asks the court to consider banning the Trumps from serving as officers of a business in New York and to stop the company from engaging in business transactions for five years.\n\nRead more about Trump’s fraud trial.\n\nTrump says he will attend his civil fraud trial in New York\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he will go to court in New York for his civil fraud trial on Monday.\n\nTrump had been expected to attend, and law enforcement and court employees had already been making security preparations for his potential appearance at the courthouse in Lower Manhattan on Monday and possibly Tuesday.\n\nTrump’s plans started to become clear after a federal judge in Florida granted his request to postpone a deposition in a separate case because it would conflict with the start of the New York trial.\n\nThe civil fraud case – brought in September 2022 by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Trump, his eldest sons, their companies and several executives – will begin at 10 a.m. Monday.\n\nRemember: Last week, the judge overseeing the case dealt Trump a major blow in ruling that the former president is liable for fraud and that he overvalued his properties on his financial statements for a decade.\n\nThe ruling came in response to the lawsuit by James, who is seeking $250 million in damages, a ban on the Trumps from serving as officers of a business in New York, and a ban on the company from engaging in business transactions for five years.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1c247874-bca4-408d-a539-93f5f113ce0b', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump delivers heated testimony in New York civil fraud trial', 'Snippet': 'Michael Bachner, a New York defence attorney, said: “Prosecutors will be sitting in the courtroom waiting for Trump to state something under oath that can be used in the criminal prosecution ...', 'Full_text': 'The new FT Digital Edition: today’s FT, cover to cover on any device.

Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar and Debbie Lesko, as well as GOP challengers Eli Crane and Kelly Cooper. Trump notably didn’t mention Rep. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani, who is the GOP nominee in a Tucson-area district.\n\nAfter doing so, Trump again turned to the dark imagery of an America in chaos because of Democratic policies. He complained of inflation and declining stocks, dead U.S. soldiers and wasted hardware in Afghanistan and with Ukraine at war.\n\n“We are a nation in decline,” Trump said near the end of his speech as sorrowful sounding music played. “We are a nation that in many ways has become a joke.”\n\n“But we are not going to allow this horror to continue,” he said. “It is hard-working patriots like you who are going to save this country.”\n\nBy the time Trump was ending his speech, many in the crowd already had walked away.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n6:40 p.m.: Trump ends speech in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has concluded his remarks at a rally in Mesa. Trump spoke for more than 90 minutes, airing many of the grievances he has repeated for years, while also giving attention to Republican candidates that he is backing in the state.\n\n6:10 p.m.: Trump says World War III could happen soon\n\nThe planet could be on the verge of World War III, former President Donald Trump said Sunday, blaming the Biden administration for failing to avert the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the spiraling tensions over it.\n\nWith characteristic self-congratulation, Trump praised himself for being correct about “everything” but said he hopes he is wrong that another global war could be on the horizon.\n\n“We must demand immediate negotiation of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine or we will end up in World War III, and there will never be a war like this. We will never have had a war like this, and that’s all because of stupid people that don’t have a clue. And it’s also because of the kind of weaponry that’s available today.”\n\nTrump castigated Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as a reliable vote for ill-considered legislation pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nMore than 45 minutes into his remarks, Trump returned repeatedly to claims of a stolen election in 2020. He called 2020 a “rigged and stolen election.”\n\n“I ran twice. I won twice,” Trump said.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen and Alison Steinbach\n\n5:55 p.m.: Trump claims predecessors took classified records\n\nFormer President Donald Trump unloaded on the FBI and accused his presidential predecessors over the criminal investigation of the documents seized from his residence at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe alluded to a third presidential run that won’t get derailed by what he views as politically motivated attacks on him.\n\n“What they’re trying to do is take us out so we can’t represent you if we decide to do that, but we’ll be making a decision very soon,” he said to rising cheers.\n\nTrump claimed that former President Bill Clinton took millions of classified records with him when he left office, and presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama also improperly took records as well.\n\nClinton lost the nuclear codes and former President Jimmy Carter sent the nuclear codes to a dry cleaner, Trump said, adding that nothing happened in those matters.\n\n“Lock her up! Lock her up!” the crowd chanted after Trump mentioned former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton kept private from officials government emails.\n\n“They should give me back everything that was taken,” Trump said of the records taken by the FBI.\n\n“They plant documents,” he said of the FBI. Trump wondered aloud when the Clintons would face investigation and prosecution.\n\n“I don’t think they will do it, and I don’t think they should do it,” Trump said.\n\nDespite his complaints, Trump said the actions against him drove his poll numbers higher.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5:30 p.m.: Trump starts speech with familiar topics\n\nFormer President Donald Trump wasted no time on Sunday launching into familiar grievances and a bleak image of America without him in the White House.\n\nCiting the influx of illegal immigrants, soaring prices and arrests of people who oppose abortion, Trump hit President Joe Biden and Democrats generally for a country in turmoil.\n\n“These are incredible people. They’re being treated like terrorists,” Trump said, vaguely alluding to those who support him or conservative causes.\n\n“Nothing happens to antifa. Nothing happens to (Black Lives Matter). But look at what happens to patriots. The Democrats are locking up their political opponents,"" he said.\n\nTrump put himself and his many controversies as the central evidence of Democrats abusing their power to hurt Republican opponents.\n\nHe complained of impeachment over what he again referred to a “perfect phone call” where he tied approval of military aid to Ukraine to that country declaring an investigation of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHe described his conversation with Georgia election officials that is under criminal investigation “an absolutely perfect phone call.”\n\nWithin seconds of taking the stage, Trump had complained about the media, alluded to his baseless claims of a stolen election and hinted that more elections could lie ahead.\n\n“We won it big and we won it a second time,” Trump said early on.\n\nHe took the stage in sun-splashed Mesa an hour later than scheduled, though those in the crowd of perhaps 5,000 at the event had stuck around without any obvious complaints.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5 p.m.: Trump takes the stage in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump started speaking to the crowd in Mesa just before 5 p.m. Sunday, about an hour later than scheduled. He started his remarks by repeating his false claim that he won Arizona in 2020 and went on the attack against Democrats.\n\n4:50 p.m.: Lake fires up crowd, but doesn\'t mention 2020 election\n\nRepublican candidate for Arizona governor Kari Lake, the former television news anchor, spoke for 18 minutes on Sunday — without once mentioning the 2020 election and the false claims about it that propelled her to political prominence.\n\nInstead, Lake painted her Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs as an absent candidate who refused to debate her, while Lake has toured the state speaking directly to voters. She connected Hobbs to the Biden administration, claiming Hobbs would raise taxes on Arizonans already feeling the brunt of record-high inflation. Hobbs has said she does not plan to do so, and either candidate would need the Legislature’s agreement to change tax policy.\n\nLake repeatedly noted a discrimination case Hobbs was involved in while Hobbs was the Democratic leader in the state Senate. A Black female Democratic staffer proved to two juries she was discriminated against and fired in retaliation by Hobbs and others after raising an issue over her pay disparity.\n\nThose verdicts, Lake said, showed Hobbs had already embarrassed the state and should not lead it. Her attacks prompted cheers from the crowd.\n\n“They’re saying lock her up,” Lake said. “I think we should just vote her out, how’s that?”\n\nLake proved victorious in August’s four-way primary election with the backing of Trump, who remains polarizing in politics. And though claims about the 2020 election being stolen or corrupt are a hallmark of her campaign — she has said she wouldn’t have certified Biden’s win in the state two years ago — she didn’t mention them Sunday.\n\nInstead, she pledged a crackdown at the border to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking and talked about economic hardship facing Arizonans. In a new policy proposal, Lake said she would work to prohibit municipalities from collecting taxes on groceries and rent. Doing both would require the Legislature to pass a bill.\n\n“It is said hard times create strong men, well they create strong women too,” she said. “And this woman is ready to put an end to the hard times. Who is ready to step up with me?”\n\nThe crowd chanted back: “Kari! Kari! Kari!”\n\n4 p.m.: Finchem promises changes to voting if elected secretary of state\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem’s walk-on music at the Mesa rally was the theme from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" To further his Western bona fides, and to take a swipe at East Coast commentators who mock his western vibe, Finchem wore his cowboy hat and sported his “Sunday Go-To Meeting Tie.“\n\nHe launched into his familiar attack on his Democratic opponent for secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, from Fontes’ missteps during the 2020 Democratic presidential preference election to his support of all-mail voting to policy changes that were slapped down by court rulings.\n\n“Just follow the law” is his campaign mantra, and he said he will stick to the rules.\n\nAs secretary of state, Finchem said he will push for post-election audits in all 15 counties and disconnect Arizona from ERIC, the Electronic Registration Information Center, which shares voter information among states to ensure there is not double voting.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n3:40 p.m.: Masters continues to pound Kelly over border, drugs, crime\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued his aggressive attacks on Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., saying he should have to attend the funerals of overdose victims killed by drugs that entered America from its porous borders.\n\nMasters rattled off a familiar list of complaints about current conditions: There are 300,000 people crossing the nation’s border each month, violent crime has soared in Phoenix since 2019 and fentanyl continues to kill Americans everywhere.\n\n“Mark Kelly has been radio silent about fentanyl for 22 months,” Masters said. That ended last week, Masters said, because he had a debate with Masters.\n\n“One month before Election Day, he says, ‘Uh oh. I better pretend to start doing something about fentanyl,’” Masters said, adding that 2,000 Arizonans have died from the drug in the past year.\n\n“I think Mark Kelly should have to attend the funerals. Let him look a grieving mother in the eye and he can explain to her why he failed to even lift a finger to secure our border,” Masters said.\n\nHis words extend attacks on Kelly that shot to prominence last week during the debate between the Senate candidates.\n\nMasters took the stage to “Danger Zone,” the song made famous in both installments of the movie “Top Gun” that is about Navy pilots. It would seem a curious choice. Kelly was a Navy fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut, while Masters never served in the military.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n3 p.m.: Hamadeh, Lesko describe a country in turmoil\n\nAbe Hamadeh, a Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona attorney general, characterized Arizona as on the front lines of defending America in a short speech at the rally in Mesa.\n\n“Arizona, we shocked the hell out of the establishment on Aug. 2, and are you ready to do it again?” Hamadeh said to loud applause.\n\nHamadeh said Democrats have harmed the country in the past couple years, citing inflation, drugs and “terrorists” crossing the border with Mexico, critical race theory in schools, censorship from big tech and Democrats who are “weaponizing the law and targeting patriots.”\n\n“Arizona is on the front lines of so many of the battles facing our country, and if we lose Arizona, we lose our country, but we’re not going to lose. We’re not going to lose because President Trump is still fighting for America,” he said.\n\nAs attorney general, Hamadeh said he would fight criminals, drug cartels and the federal government and “lock up some people and put handcuffs on them,” prompting cheers in the crowd of “lock them up.”\n\n“America has been down before, but America has never been out. The rest of the country is watching, they’re watching what we do right here in Arizona, because if we win, there’s still hope for America. And when we win, when we win, Arizona will lead America’s greatest comeback and never look back,"" he said.\n\nThe dark imagery was a theme among speakers.\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., described a dystopian America on the verge of collapse in the hands of Democrats in her remarks Sunday.\n\nInflation, a “totally open border,” fentanyl and violent crime have surged under President Joe Biden with help from congressional Democrats, Lesko told the crowd in Mesa.\n\nAnd authorities have hounded Trump since he began his political career, she said.\n\n“They continue to go after President Trump for six years,” she said, also lamenting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “to take away our rights” presumably during the pandemic.\n\n“If our country is going to survive, this has got to stop,” Lesko said.\n\n— Alison Steinbach and Ronald J. Hansen\n\n2:40 p.m.: Republicans rally with Katie Hobbs in Paradise Valley\n\nDemocratic candidate for governor Katie Hobbs held a brief news conference Sunday morning at Barry Goldwater Memorial Park in Paradise Valley to emphasize that Republicans should support her over rival Kari Lake.\n\nSeveral members of Hobbs’ “Republicans for Katie Hobbs Coalition” gathered with her at the park, which celebrates the state’s conservative icon who died in 1998 following five terms as a U.S. senator.\n\nKarie Dozer, a former spokesman for the late state Attorney General Grant Woods, said Goldwater would be “shaking his head in disgust” at how “crazy” Republican politics have become.\n\nKari Lake is “dangerous for Arizona,” said Mesa Mayor John Giles, and that’s why he — a Republican — was at the park with Hobbs and not at Trump’s rally in Mesa on Sunday.\n\n“Those of us who support Secretary Hobbs care very deeply about the future of Arizona,” he said. “And that’s why we are putting our state above our party.”\n\nNovember’s election wasn’t between Republicans and Democrats, but “a choice between sanity and chaos,” he added.\n\nMonica Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, describing herself as a former Republican, emphasized that the nation has “moved forward” under Biden.\n\nShe didn’t leave the party, she said — it left her when it began running “candidates operating from places of hatred, hubris and hostility rather than honesty, humility and humanity.”\n\nHobbs, repeating Giles’ statement about “sanity” and “chaos,” said the problem isn’t just that Lake “proudly accepts support from Nazis and spews dang conspiracy theories, it’s what she would actually do as governor.”\n\nHobbs then ran down a litany of Lake’s positions, including her support for a territorial-era anti-abortion law, baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, and surveillance cameras in public-school classrooms.\n\nLake’s entire platform “boils down into being a sore loser,” she said.\n\nOther Republicans at the event included former Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana and former state legislator Steve May.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n2 p.m.: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appears at rally\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., echoed the language of the Great Replacement theory popular with white nationalists in her message to Arizonans in Mesa on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking about illegal immigration, Greene said 5 million people have crossed the Mexican border with impunity from a derelict President Joe Biden.\n\n“Five million people from all over the world have crossed our borders,” Greene said. “Joe Biden’s 5 million illegal aliens are on the verge of replacing you, replacing your jobs, replacing your kids in school, and coming from all over the world they are also replacing your culture. That’s not great for America.”\n\nThe replacement theory is an idea first popular among white nationalists that Democrats want illegal immigrants to keep their party politically viable.\n\nSome Republicans have flirted with similar rhetoric to energize their base, which has long seen the border as dangerously porous.\n\nGreene has long pushed a nationalist message. Last year, Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., were briefly linked to creating an America First Caucus that was reportedly linked to preserving the nation’s Anglo-Saxon past and dramatically restricting the nation’s immigration laws. Both lawmakers quickly distanced themselves from the caucus idea after bipartisan pushback.\n\nBefore taking the stage, Greene predicted the shifting state of Arizona’s law on abortion rights would not play a significant role in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe state’s guiding law seems to have whipsawed between a Civil War-era law that bans nearly all abortions and a law passed earlier this year that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDespite the conflicting rulings and the attention it brings back to the issue, Greene said it won’t have an impact on voting in Arizona.\n\n“I don’t think it’s distracting at all,” she told a reporter before taking the stage in Mesa. Instead, America-first themes, like those identified by Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters, will resonate with voters, she said.\n\nGreene said she is looking forward to Republicans winning back the House of Representatives after the November elections. When that happens, she said, she will be placed on the House Oversight Committee, where she plans to open investigations into Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s embattled son.\n\nGreene also said Big Tech will face scrutiny over its “collusion” with Democrats in 2020 to censor conservative voices.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n1:45 p.m.: Trump, Lake supporters travel from Arizona, out of state\n\nAs the prayer, pledge of allegiance and national anthem began shortly before 1:30 p.m., attendees were still streaming into the dirt lot at Bell Bank Park. Seats were filled in the relatively small area of floor seating and risers around the speaking platform.\n\nAfter the national anthem, a chant of “USA, USA, USA” rose through the crowd. Many wore Trump attire, some wore anti-Biden clothes, and lots wore red, white and blue apparel, including a few people draped in American or Arizona flags.\n\nA few people were carried out on stretchers; it was a hot and sunny afternoon.\n\n“We’re just real Trump people,” said Ann-Marie Villicana, who drove from Pasadena, California, on Saturday to see Trump on Sunday.\n\nVillicana said she founded LA Trump and was a delegate from California in 2016. One of her friends is working with Lake so she came out to show support.\n\n“Since we haven’t been able to get out to Arizona to help Kari Lake, we thought the least we could do was donate money, get great seats,” she said. She and Robin Salzer had VIP seats.\n\n“People are just fed up and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” Salzer said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Schafer of Chandler voted for Trump and is a big supporter but said she hadn’t gone to one of his events until Sunday.\n\n“I am brokenhearted that America is in the condition it’s in,” she said, adding that she’s concerned about issues like inflation, the 2nd Amendment and school curriculum.\n\nSchaefer was excited to hear from Trump and Lake in particular. “I’m 100% Trumpster, I’m 100% Kari Lake,” she said, wearing a Trump shirt and hat. She said the midterm election will be “honest” because so many more people are paying attention.\n\nMaria Foshay traveled from Rancho Cucamonga, California, to hear Trump speak. She hopes he’ll announce his next move during the speech, ideally that he’ll run for president again in 2024. Foshay wants to make sure the election is truthful, fair and with “no cheating.”\n\nKerry Josey of Mesa said Trump is “the face of the people,” adding that she’s been to three of his rallies. She’s concerned about whether the upcoming election will be truthful.\n\nKathy Elgin stood out in the sea of red-colored couture with her eye-catching Oregon Women for Trump-shirt. She and four friends flew in from Oregon for a quick turnaround trip solely for Trump.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” Elgin said.\n\nA resident of Salem, Elgin said Oregon was a red state “until we got mail-in voting.” Since then, she said, the state has turned blue and she doesn’t buy it.\n\nAn avid Trump follower, Elgin said she got a visit from FBI after returning from the Jan. 6 rally at the U.S. Capitol. She called the visit “audacious” explaining that she never witnessed any violence at the Capitol until she saw television footing.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, Eryka Forquer and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n12 p.m.: Who is scheduled to speak at Trump rally in Mesa\n\nThe speaker list for Sunday\'s rally includes names familiar to Arizonans, as well as some of the more outspoken Trump advocates, including U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nTwo members of Arizona\'s congressional delegation are on board to address the rally: Republican representatives Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko.\n\nThey will join former Trump administration staffers Rich Grenell and Kash Patel, who were with Trump at a similar rally in Nevada on Saturday.\n\nGrenell served briefly as acting director of National Intelligence in 2020, while also holding the posts of U.S. ambassador to Germany and special presidential envoy for the Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations.\n\nPatel was former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nThe event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November\'s election. Arizona candidates slated to speak are gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. U.S. Senate nominee Blake Masters, secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem and attorney general nominee Abe Hamedeh.\n\nThe speeches are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n11 a.m.: Masters: \'This race is winnable\'\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued what amounted to a victory lap ahead of his rally with former President Donald Trump in Mesa later today.\n\nMasters appeared with Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" on Fox News and made the case that his showing in Thursday\'s debate with Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., had reversed the race.\n\n""I expected him to struggle to defend (his record in the Senate) and he did,"" Masters said of Kelly. ""All I had to do, Maria, was go out there and tell the truth. Explain to the people how Mark Kelly has kept our border wide open, how his votes for all the crazy trillions of dollars in spending have caused inflation.""\n\n""I think we had him on the ropes a little bit, and it\'s a huge vibe shift, a momentum shift for our campaign,"" he continued.\n\nAsked about the lack of financial investment from some conservative corners, Masters predicted, ""a lot more people are going to get involved.""\n\n""I think I showed people that this race is winnable, that I\'m a much, much better candidate than Sen. Kelly in that debate the other night.""\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n10 a.m.: Lake and Hobbs on national TV prior to Trump rally\n\nArizona’s candidates for governor appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation morning news show Sunday, just hours ahead of Trump’s visit to the state.\n\nThe former president wasn’t the focus of the discussion; instead, Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs and Republican nominee Kari Lake discussed their plans for border security, abortion and other issues, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nThe interviews, conducted separately and aired back to back, might be the closest equivalent to a debate a national audience will see this cycle. They highlighted the stylistic and policy differences of two women locked in a nationally watched race that most polls say is tied.\n\nLake has shifted from praising a near-total ban on abortion to saying she will follow the law. She did so again Sunday. Arizona has two conflicting laws on the books, but a court ruling Friday has allowed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks except for in medical emergencies to prevail.\n\nLake told CBS news correspondent Major Garrett the “law right now as it stands is Gov. Ducey\'s law at 15 weeks, so we\'ll follow the law,” according to a transcript of the interview.\n\nGarrett likewise tried to pin down Hobbs’ position on abortion, which Lake has painted as extreme because Hobbs has repeatedly declined to say if there is a stage of pregnancy after which she thinks abortion should be prohibited. Pressed on that, Garrett asked Hobbs if an Arizona voter would be right to conclude that she does “not favor any specific week limit on abortion.”\n\n“I support leaving the decision between a woman and her doctor and leaving politicians entirely out of it,” Hobbs replied.\n\nLake spent much of her interview talking about her plan to use state law enforcement as border patrol and deportation officers, an authority she’d seek using an untested legal theory that would buck decades of court precedent and likely lead to a lawsuit.\n\n“I hope that Joe Biden doesn\'t fight us because then it would really look like he is on the side of the cartel,” she said.\n\nLake didn’t mention Trump in her interview, perhaps a reflection of his unpopularity with voters nationally. Hobbs brought up the former president twice, attacking his record at the southern border and his false claims the 2020 election was “stolen,” which Lake has parroted.\n\nHobbs said Trump’s effort to build the border wall, the signature of his border policy, wasn’t finished and called on the Biden administration to “step up.”\n\nAsked why she wouldn’t debate Lake, and if her decision not to participate shortchanged voters of a chance to see how Hobbs would respond in a moment of duress, Hobbs shifted to Trump.\n\n“I think the voters of Arizona have had a chance to see how I work under crisis throughout my leadership during the 2020 election as secretary of state,” Hobbs said, “when we had to combat multiple election challenges from former President Trump and his band of election deniers, including my opponent Kari Lake.""\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n9 a.m.: 17 visits and counting\n\nArizona\'s political preeminence seems like a given these days, but the red state-turned-purple battleground coincides almost perfectly with the political rise of Donald Trump.\n\nThe former president found early enthusiasm for his America-first message in Arizona in 2015, and he never really stopped coming back.\n\nHis scheduled rally in Mesa will add to an Arizona total no president or presidential contender can rival, with big asterisks for Barry Goldwater and John McCain, who lived in the state while pursuing the White House.\n\nAccording to Republic research, Trump has made at least 17 visits since entering politics.\n\nThat is a list that began on July 11, 2015, with a stop in Phoenix that focused on immigration and helped set the tone for his upstart campaign.\n\nBy the end of the 2016 campaign, Trump made six more stops in Arizona. He carried the state by 3.5 percentage points, an unusually low margin in a state that had voted Republican in all but one presidential election beginning in 1952.\n\nTrump visited the state seven times in 2020. That included a Feb. 19, 2020, rally in Phoenix just weeks before the pandemic halted campaign visits for months.\n\nIn May 2020, Trump started to move about again, with a stop at a Phoenix Honeywell facility making respirator masks to cope with the health crisis and to discuss aid to Native Americans.\n\nHe wound up losing Arizona in 2020 by fewer than 11,000 votes, the smallest margin in the country.\n\nTrump made his first post-presidential visit to Arizona on July 24, 2021, at a Turning Point Action rally in Phoenix in which he saw firsthand the raucous reception to Kari Lake by Republicans.\n\nHe wrongly predicted the ongoing review of Maricopa County ballots would vindicate his baseless claims of a stolen election.\n\nThis year, Trump held a January rally in Florence, a pre-primary rally in Prescott Valley in July and is set now to again back his slate of Republicans on Sunday in Mesa.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-cnn-town-hall/index.html', 'Headline': 'Trump town hall on CNN: Live updates | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'The Biden campaign is already working to pinpoint moments from the town hall that they can turn into ads and digital content, including Trump’s comments on January 6, election denialism ...', 'Full_text': 'The 2024 presidential campaign is only beginning, but former President Donald Trump made clear that his third bid for the White House will feel very much like the first two.\n\nTrump might be trying a new tack in this campaign, running what is, to date, a more conventional race with less internal drama. But when pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, the 76-year-old showed on Wednesday night that he is very much the same person Americans came to know in 2016, throughout his four years in office, and in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the mostly Trump-loyal audience lapped it up. Trump’s place in the GOP primary polls, as he often mentioned, is strong. In New Hampshire on Wednesday night, he showed why.\n\nHere are some takeaways from Trump’s CNN town hall:\n\nTrump says GOP should be willing to blow up debt ceiling: The US is on the brink of a catastrophic default on its sovereign debt. Asked what his advice is to Republicans in Washington, Trump was clear. “If they don’t give you massive cuts,” he said, “you’re going to have to do a default.” The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking so-called extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.\n\nTrump makes dismissive comments about Carroll: A little more than 24 hours after a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, and awarded her $5 million, the former president denied the accusations and again said he had never met Carroll. “This woman, I don’t know her. I never met her. I have no idea who she is,” Trump said, before going off on an odd tangent about her former husband and a pet.\n\nTrump also brushed off a question over whether the verdict would hurt his standing with female voters, saying he doubted it. The reaction from the Trump-friendly audience appeared to support his opinion – they laughed at his jokes and other dismissive comments about Carroll.\n\nTrump doesn’t say if he would back Ukraine in war with Russia: Trump refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to prevail in its war with invading Russia.“I don’t think in terms of winning and losing,” he said, “I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people.” Asked to choose a side he would prefer to win, Trump again demurred. “I want everyone to stop dying,” he said before promising to end the war in “24 hours.”\n\nTrump suggests family separation immigration policy could return: Trump said he would return to one of the harshest immigration enforcement policies imposed by his administration: separating migrant families at the US-Mexico border. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said. His comments come as Title 42, the Trump-era pandemic public health restriction that became a key tool officials used to expel migrants at the US-Mexico border, is set to expire Thursday.\n\nTrump was vague on federal abortion ban: Trump repeatedly ducked questions about whether he would sign into law a federal abortion ban, as well as questions regarding after how many weeks into a pregnancy abortion should be made illegal. He touted the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade’s federal abortion rights as “such a great victory” – and one made possible by his appointment of three conservative justices. Trump said he supports exemptions to abortion bans for cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is threatened. “We now have a great negotiating ability, and I think we’re going to be able to get something done,” Trump said.\n\nRead more takeaways from tonight’s town hall here and read our team’s fact checks here.\n\nOne of the many jarring moments during CNN’s town hall with former President Donald Trump occurred when the moderator, CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins, was asking Trump why he held on to classified documents when he left the White House. The FBI later recovered them from Mar a Lago by executing a search warrant.\n\nWhen Collins pointed out that the difference between Trump and Joe Biden, who also faces questions about classified documents found at his house but who didn’t ignore a subpoena, Trump interrupted her.\n\n“Are you ready? Can I talk?” Trump demanded. “Do you mind?”\n\n“Yeah, I would like for you to answer the question. That’s why I asked it,” Collins said.\n\n“It’s very simple that you’re a nasty person, I’ll tell you,” Trump said, attempting to insult her as his supporters in the crowd cheered.\n\n“Can you answer why you held on to the documents?” Collins asked again, at which point Trump launched into a rambling answer that boils down to he was negotiating with the National Archives during the year-plus when the government was seeking them.\n\nIt’s the insult to Collins’ face, calling her “nasty,” that was jarring. And the cheering crowd made it more so.\n\nThe word has long been a favorite insult of Trump’s, often hurled at women who frustrate him.\n\nHe called Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman” at the close of the final presidential debate in 2016.\n\nHe’s used it on Vice President Kamala Harris and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nOf Meghan Markle, who had criticized him, in 2019, Trump told a British newspaper, “I didn’t know that she was nasty.”\n\nAfter he hurled the insult at Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen later that summer, the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake documented 14 times Trump had used the insult to describe a woman. He found even more instances of Trump using the word to describe a man, although some of those appeared to be complements.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed that the classified documents from the White House were “automatically declassified” when he took them to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence to back up this assertion. Trump and his team have not provided any proof that Trump actually conducted some sort of broad declassification of the documents that ended up at Mar-a-Lago – and, so far, his lawyers notably have not argued in their court filings that Trump did so.\n\nThe Justice Department said in an August 2022 court filing that Trump’s representatives never asserted that documents had been declassified—not in January 2022 when they voluntarily turned over 15 boxes that included 184 unique documents with classification markings, nor in June 2022 when Trump’s team responded to a subpoena by returning another batch that included 38 additional unique documents with classification markings.\n\nIn addition, 18 former top Trump administration officials, including two former White House chiefs of staff who spoke on the record, told CNN at the time that they never heard of a standing Trump declassification order when they were serving in the administration and that they now believe the claim is false. The former officials used words like “ludicrous,” “ridiculous” and “bullsh*t.”\n\n“Total nonsense,” said one person who served as a senior White House official. “If that’s true, where is the order with his signature on it? If that were the case, there would have been tremendous pushback from the Intel Community and DoD, which would almost certainly have become known to Intel and Armed Services Committees on the Hill.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump asserted Wednesday night that “a couple” of the January 6 rioters “probably got out of control,” comparing the insurrection to left-leaning protests that turned violent in other cities.\n\nFacts First: This statement is false. Hundreds of rioters have been charged with violence toward police on January 6 and Trump downplaying of the violence and equivocating the insurrection with social justice protests fails to recognize the severity of the attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe January 6 riot of by Trump supporters who overran the Capitol has resulted in the largest law enforcement response in modern history – because of the sheer amount of violence on the ground, especially toward police, that day.\n\nThe number of rioters who’ve been charged with violence toward police is in the hundreds.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department this week, 346 people face federal charges for assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or other employees. That includes more than 100 people charged with using a weapon or causing serious injury to an officer. About five dozen have pleaded guilty to felony charges for these types of crimes.\n\nAnd the FBI is still seeking information to identify more than 220 others who may have committed violent crimes on the Capitol grounds.\n\nEven Trump-appointed federal judges have countered claims that left-leaning rioters in Portland, for instance, acted similarly to the pro-Trump crowd on January 6.\n\nJudge Trevor McFadden wrote when handling a January 6 rioter’s case in 2021: “Although both Portland and January 6 rioters attacked federal buildings, the Portland defendants primarily attacked at night, meaning that they raged against a largely vacant courthouse. In contrast, the January 6 rioters attacked the Capitol in broad daylight. And many entered it.”\n\nAnd another federal judge in DC, Carl Nichols, wrote: “The Portland rioters’ conduct, while obviously serious, did not target a proceeding prescribed by the Constitution and established to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Nor did the Portland rioters, unlike those who assailed America’s Capitol in 2021, make it past the buildings’ outer defenses.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s answers to questions from New Hampshire voters about a variety of topics at the CNN town hall Wednesday may have opened the door for other Republicans to challenge him in the 2024 presidential primary race, Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House director of communications and CNN political commentator, said.\n\nThe former president often dodged directly answering questions and giving specific policy stances in the town hall, such as not saying if he would sign a federal abortion ban or if he wanted Ukraine or Russia to win the war. Trump repeated his election lies and attempted to repaint his role during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nIssues like crime and the economy, however, are what are on the minds of most voters on a day-to-day basis, Farah Griffin said.\n\nFarah Griffin pointed to a statement from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ super PAC criticizing Trump as an example of how other candidates could be taking advantage.\n\n“After 76 years, Trump still doesn’t know where he stands on important conservative issues like supporting life and the 2nd amendment. How does that Make America Great Again?” the statement said.\n\nThe super PAC in a tweet also touched on several issues including possible pardons for January 6 rioters and the investigation into classified documents at Mar-a-Lago — topics that DeSantis has not criticized Trump over and in some cases has outright avoided discussing at all.\n\n“This to me actually became an opening for a Republican to take him on and say, if you want a lot of the policies — not insane things like family separation — and you don’t want chaos and anti-democratic positions,” Farah Griffin said.\n\nCNN’s Steve Contorno and Alayna Treene contributed reporting to this post.\n\nFormer and current Republican governors reacted to former President Trump’s claims throughout CNN’s town hall in New Hampshire on Wednesday evening.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu: The Republican governor told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that Trump didn’t say anything that he thinks will help him win the GOP nomination for president. “It was kind of the same old thing, the same old regurgitation. He had a chance to move on from 2020, he didn’t do it. He had a chance to own some of the issues of January 6, what his role there was. He didn’t do it. He had the chance to take shots at Joe Biden, he didn’t do it,” Sununu said.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie: After Donald Trump said he would end Russia’s war in Ukraine in 24 hours, the Republican tweeted that “despite how ridiculous that is to say, I suspect he would try to do it by turning Ukraine over to Putin and Russia. #Putin’sPuppet.”\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson: The 2024 challenger to Trump said on CNN that the former president “had a weak performance and he’s locked in the past.”\n\n“He had a goal, I’m sure, to expand his base to be able to prove that he can attract independents and the suburban voters. He failed that test. He narrowed his base of support, he’s locked in the past, he didn’t address the issues (of) the future,” the Republican said.\n\n“Whenever he was asked about the economy, he gave one brief response on energy policy, but really didn’t address the broad range of things we have in our economy to get it going again,” he added.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took questions from Republican and undeclared voters in New Hampshire at the town hall moderated by “CNN This Morning” anchor Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday night.\n\nTrump remained defiant about his lies regarding the 2020 election, as well as the many investigations into him – making clear that he’s sticking to the script he’s delivered over the past two years on conservative media.\n\nHere is some of what he said on key topics:\n\nElection lies: Trump again refused to acknowledge that he lost the 2020 presidential election several times, and instead reiterated false claims that the election was rigged. CNN’s Collins continuously pushed back and pointed to statements by Trump’s own election officials noting the election was conducted fairly. He later only said he would accept the 2024 presidential election results if he believed they were “honest.”\n\nJanuary 6 insurrection: Trump blamed then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi among others, saying they were at fault for the security failures on January 6, 2021. Trump falsely claimed that he called on the National Guard to intervene during the riot and in an extended exchange with Collins about the riot, Trump attempted to repaint his role during the insurrection. He also said he would pardon “a large portion” of rioters.\n\nMike Pence: Trump said that he does not feel like he owes his former vice president an apology. Pence has said the former president endangered his life during the January 6 insurrection. “No, because he did something wrong. He should’ve put the votes back to the state legislatures and I think we would’ve had a different outcome,” Trump said, though Pence did not have the authority to reject election results.\n\nE. Jean Carroll: Trump continued to deny knowing the columnist and denied accusations, just a day after a jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her in a department store. The former president also ridiculed Carroll and said he does not believe the verdict disqualifies him from being president or will have an impact on women voters.\n\nThe economy: If reelected, Trump said his solution to inflation would be drilling for more oil in the US. The former president then claimed that under his presidency, the country was energy independent and that the cost of gas went down to record lows. You can read a fact check on those claims here.\n\nThe debt ceiling: Trump said the US should default on its debt if the White House does not agree to Republican spending cuts. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit. The White House and GOP Republicans are in a standoff over how to resolve the issue.\n\nGun violence: The former president pledged to protect the Second Amendment if he is back in the White House. He said he would address mental health problems as well as “do numerous things” to address mass shootings, including hiring more security guards for schools and what he called “hardening” entrances to establishments.\n\nAbortion: Trump would not say if he would sign a federal abortion ban if he was reelected or at how many weeks during pregnancy he would support a ban. Trump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country.” He argued those in the anti-abortion movement are “in a very good negotiating position right now” because of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe war in Ukraine: Trump said he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and with Russian President Vladimir Putin and solve the war in Ukraine “in one day, 24 hours.” He would not say if he believed Putin was a war criminal and said the Russian leader “made a mistake” going into Ukraine, arguing he wouldn’t have done so if Trump was president. Trump wouldn’t say whether he wants Ukraine or Russia to win the war.\n\nClassified documents: The former president insisted that he had “every right” to take classified documents with him after he left the White House. He falsely claimed that the documents became declassified when he took them with him.\n\nAsked why he took classified documents with him after leaving the White House, former President Donald Trump said he “had every right to under the Presidential Records Act.”\n\n“I was there and I took what I took and it gets declassified,” Trump said during Wednesday night’s CNN town hall.\n\nCollins corrected Trump saying the Presidential Records Act does not say a former president can take documents home but says they are the property of the federal government when a president is out of office.\n\nAfter Trump and Collins went back and forth on previous presidents taking classified documents, Collins pushed back saying previous presidents didn’t wait to return classified documents and asked numerous times why Trump waited to return classified documents when he knew the federal government was seeking them and subpoenaed him to return them.\n\nTrump did not answer the question but instead insulted Collins.\n\n“It’s very simple — you’re a nasty person, I’ll tell you,” Trump said.\n\nMore context: Special counsel Jack Smith is overseeing the Justice Department’s criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and into parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were taken to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury has interviewed potential witnesses regarding how Trump handled the documents.\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records.\n\nAny unauthorized retention or destruction of White House documents could violate a criminal law that prohibits the removal or destruction of official government records, legal experts told CNN.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Wednesday would not say whether he would sign a federal abortion ban if reelected when pressed several times by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, but argued those in the anti-abortion movement are “in a very good negotiating position right now” because of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nTrump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country” when asked if he would sign a federal abortion ban.\n\nAs many states move to restrict abortion rights after the Supreme Court ruled there is no constitutional right to an abortion, Trump would not specify whether he would support a federal ban or at how many weeks during a pregnancy he would support a ban.\n\n“I’m looking at a solution that’s going to work. Very complex issue for the country. You have people on both sides of an issue, but we are now in a very strong position. Pro-life people are in a strong position to make a deal that’s going to be good and going to be satisfactory for them. If you weren’t able to get rid of, you wouldn’t be having a discussion, if you weren’t able to get rid of Roe V. Wade,” Trump said.\n\nMore context: In the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, many Republican-led states have enacted sweeping abortion restrictions. But unpopularity, demonstrated in some instances by electoral evidence, over severe restrictions has prompted Republicans to reconsider the political wisdom of enacting near-total bans on the procedure, and House Republicans have recently stepped away from pushing a federal abortion ban.\n\nMarta Saravia, an undeclared voter, asked former President Donald Trump what he thought of the debt situation and how the country can move forward.\n\n“We have to start paying off debt … I say to the Republicans out there — Congressmen, Senators — if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default, and I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave will absolutely cave because you don’t want to have that happen, but it’s better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors,” Trump said.\n\nCollins asked Trump to clarify, asking him if he thinks the US should default if the White House does not agree to spending cuts the Republicans are demanding.\n\nMore context: The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.\n\nThe White House and GOP Republicans are in a standoff over how to resolve the issue. House Republicans want to attach spending reductions to a debt ceiling increase and have passed a debt limit plan that does just that. But Biden and congressional Democrats have insisted on passing a clean increase on the debt limit before addressing a framework for spending.\n\nA breach of the US debt ceiling risks sparking a 2008-style economic catastrophe that wipes out millions of jobs and sets America back for generations, Moody’s Analytics has warned. The impact could include delayed Social Security payments, late paychecks for federal employees and veterans and a direct hit to Americans’ investments.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he does not think a recent verdict in which a Manhattan federal jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room disqualifies him from being president or will have an impact on women voters.\n\nHe denied knowing the columnist and denied the accusations. Trump ridiculed Carroll while discussing the trial, only a day after the verdict was handed down.\n\n“A Manhattan jury found you sexually abused writer E. Jean You’ve denied this. But what do you say to voters who say it disqualifies you from being president?” CNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked.\n\nTrump answered that he didn’t think there were many voters who would think that. He claimed that the case was made up and that it was all politically motivated. He repeated that he did not know Carroll, but said that he took a photo “years ago” with her and her husband.\n\nWhen asked if the jury’s decision would deter women from voting for him, the former president said, “No, I don’t think so.”\n\nSome context: A Manhattan federal jury found Tuesday that Trump sexually abused Carroll in the spring of 1996 and awarded her $5 million for battery and defamation.\n\nCarroll alleged Trump raped her in the Bergdorf Goodman department store and then defamed her when he denied her claim, said she wasn’t his type and suggested she made up the story to boost sales of her book. Trump denied all wrongdoing. He does not face any jail time as a result of the civil verdict.\n\nWhile the jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, the jury did not find that Carroll proved he raped her.\n\nCarroll filed the lawsuit last November under the “New York State Adult Survivors Act,” a state bill that opened a look-back window for sexual assault allegations like Carroll’s with long-expired statutes of limitation.\n\nThere’s a definite feel at Saint Anselm College that the 2024 presidential campaign is really beginning tonight. There’s excitement, tension and dissent in the air that recalls the build-up to a presidential debate.\n\nThe fact that the unpredictable Donald Trump is the presidential frontrunner after a tumultuous presidency and refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election is only deepening the feeling that something big is about to happen – as town hall attendees line up to clear Secret Service security checks near protesters shouting anti-Trump slogans.\n\nMany of the registered Republicans and voters who plan to vote in the 2024 GOP primary are hoping they will get called upon.\n\nOne Trump supporter, Karen Langella, said that she hoped that the questions would “not focus on what happened” on Tuesday when a jury found Trump sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in 1996 in New York and that he was liable for battery and defamation after a civil trial.\n\nLangella’s daughter, Isabella, who is an independent and shopping around for the most conservative Republican candidate, hoped that “people stick to his ideas and his policies instead of what happened 20 years ago.”\n\nAnother attendee, Al Peel, hoped to get a question to Trump about his own ideas on how to help homeless veterans. He also wanted the former president to tone down his wild antics and focus instead on policies.\n\n“I think he’s Bozo the Clown, OK. But I love his results,” he added.\n\nAcross the road, a crowd of students held up signs reading “love Trumps hate” and “nobody is above the law,” while chanting “You’re abhorrent, you’re broke, you lost the popular vote.”\n\nMore about the town hall location: Saint Anselm College has its own fabled history in presidential campaigns. Republican Richard Nixon made it his first stop in his successful 1968 bid for the presidency. Pretty much every one who is anyone in presidential politics has visited — from Ronald Reagan, both presidents Bush, Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe Benedictine liberal arts college hosted a fiery Democratic presidential debate days before the 2008 primary that saw Hillary Clinton win a comeback victory after Barack Obama won the Iowa caucuses — though it was a false dawn for the then New York senator’s campaign.\n\nIt’s long been known that former President Donald Trump’s actions while in office have upended the norms of the presidency — from his use of social media to make major announcements to his use of the pardon power to the amount of turnover in his administration.\n\nThe story of the Trump presidency cannot be fully told in numbers. But here are some numbers illustrate some of the many ways Trump and his administration defied the status quo of the executive branch.\n\nJudicial appointments: Trump was able to successfully appoint three US Supreme Court justices, and he’s surpassed the number of federal judges appointed by George H.W. Bush — the most recent one-term president.\n\nEarlier in 2020, Trump was also on track to appoint more federal appellate judges than any recent president at the same point in his presidency, according to the Pew Research Center. Although Trump served only four years, his changes to the makeup of federal courts will be felt long after he leaves the White House.\n\nExecutive action: As of December 11, 2020, there had been 520 presidential documents signed by Trump — including executive orders, presidential memorandums, determinations and notices — had been published in the Federal Register. Of those, 288 were executive orders and presidential memorandums, not including memos were clerical in nature.\n\nPresidents have increasingly used executive orders and presidential memorandums interchangeably to issue directives to their agencies; they are both legally binding, though executive action can be undone by the next president.\n\nThe increased reliance on such actions has come as an increasingly gridlocked Congress has made it difficult for presidents to act on their agendas.\n\nObama had issued 226 executive orders and memorandums at this point in his tenure in office, while George W. Bush had signed 189.\n\nBefore becoming president, Trump complained about what he saw as Obama’s overuse of executive authority but also suggested that the government could be run like a business.\n\nYet Trump has already exceeded both George W. Bush and Obama in the number of published executive orders and memorandums.\n\nRead about other key figures from his presidency here.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign is pursuing a strategy of expanding his appeal by reaching out to audiences beyond friendly conservative media outlets, multiple advisers familiar with the strategy said, including a CNN town hall this week.\n\nThe town hall event in New Hampshire Wednesday evening, Trump’s first appearance on CNN since the 2016 election, joins a list of other signs that Trump is adopting a more traditional campaign in his third run for the White House.\n\nThe former president has surrounded himself with a more organized, experienced team to complement his unconventional campaign style. He’s also scaling back larger rallies, a Trump campaign trademark, for more intimate campaign settings and retail stops that allow the former president to engage with voters.\n\nThat approach speaks to an acknowledgment by the Trump campaign and its allies that the former president must broaden his appeal inside and outside the Republican Party if he is to clinch the GOP nomination and retake the White House in 2024, following his failed reelection bid and disappointing results by Republicans in last year’s midterm elections. The process is being driven by a team of veteran political operatives, skilled in matters such as the delegate process, who believe Trump’s path to victory cannot simply be a reprisal of his insurgent 2016 bid or his large, expensive 2020 operation.\n\nThe former president’s team has increased its outreach with traditional news outlets, taking questions from television and print correspondents on recent campaign swings from organizations Trump has spent years attacking.\n\nTrump’s team also sees the town hall has an opportunity to draw a contrast with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has clashed with what he often refers to as “legacy media” organizations.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nWednesday’s live town hall audience will be made up of Republicans and undeclared voters who plan to vote in the GOP primary.\n\nThis is Trump’s third trip to the Granite State since launching his campaign last fall. He handily won the primaries there in 2016 and 2020 before losing the state in both general elections.\n\nNew Hampshire is the second state to vote in the Republican presidential nominating calendar — but after the Iowa caucuses, it’s the first primary to take place.\n\nThe Granite State has long prized its role in vetting presidential contenders, and state law protects that status: Secretary of State David Scanlan is required to set a primary date a week ahead of any other “similar contests” elsewhere on the map. Democrats have reshuffled their primary calendar, leaving some dates in flux, but the GOP has maintained New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary status.\n\nThough New Hampshire is among the smallest states in delegate counts, it has a history of propelling primary winners forward toward Super Tuesday with momentum — and winnowing out candidates who fail to gain traction there.\n\nThe winners of the last two competitive New Hampshire Republican presidential primaries, Mitt Romney in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016 went on to win the party’s nomination.\n\nNew Hampshire’s primary allows “undeclared” voters — those who are not registered as Democrats or Republicans — to choose which primary they participate in. It’s a key voting bloc since about two-in-five New Hampshire voters are undeclared.\n\nThe process has its quirks: Three tiny locations, Dixville Notch, Hart’s Location and Millsfield, vote at midnight and report their tiny numbers of votes immediately. Those vote tallies aren’t large enough sample sizes to be indicative of anything, but they are the only known results for nearly 20 hours, until polls elsewhere close that evening.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination, will take questions from New Hampshire Republicans and undeclared voters in a CNN town hall Wednesday as a myriad of legal issues loom over his 2024 White House bid.\n\nThe town hall will be moderated by “CNN This Morning” anchor Kaitlan Collins at Saint Anselm College and is Trump’s first appearance on the network since 2016.\n\nTrump is set to face voters as he deals with unprecedented legal clouds hanging over him and as he seeks to become only the second commander-in-chief, ever, elected to two non-consecutive terms.\n\nThe town hall comes just a day after a Manhattan federal jury found the former president sexually abused E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in 1996 and awarded her $5 million for battery and defamation.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing and called the verdict in the civil case a “total disgrace.”\n\nLast month in New York, he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump also faces potential legal peril in both Washington, DC — where a special counsel is leading a pair of investigations — and in Georgia, where the Fulton County district attorney plans to announce charges this summer from the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State.\n\nStill, the twice-impeached former president has repeatedly said that any charges will not stop him from running for president, dismissing all of the investigations as politically motivated witch hunts.\n\nThat’s a view many GOP voters share, according to recent surveys. Nearly 70% of Republican primary voters in a recent NBC News poll said investigations into the former president “are politically motivated” and that “no other candidate is like him, we must support him.”\n\nWhile a handful of rivals have entered the Republican presidential primary, and Trump’s biggest potential rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, has not yet officially launched a bid — Trump has maintained a healthy lead in early GOP primary polling.\n\nIn a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday, 43% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents named Trump unprompted when asked who they would like to see the party nominate in 2024, compared with 20% naming DeSantis, and 2% or less naming any other candidate.\n\nTrump’s participation in the town hall is indicative of a broader campaign strategy to try to expand his appeal beyond conservative media viewers, CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported earlier Wednesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump enters Wednesday’s CNN town hall as both the prohibitive GOP frontrunner for the 2024 nomination and a man just found liable in a civil case for sexually abusing and defaming former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n\nWhile we cannot yet know what effect that verdict will have on the race for the Republican nomination, Trump’s large polling advantage was built with this civil trial in the news and after being indicted earlier this spring in a separate criminal case related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. (Trump has denied all wrongdoing.)\n\nThe leads Trump has in surveys of Republican voters and in endorsements from elected officials at this stage are some of the strongest for a nonincumbent in the modern presidential primary era.\n\nTrump is polling, on average, north of 50% in national polls of likely GOP primary voters. His nearest potential challenger – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has yet to launch a campaign – is earning a little north of 20% of the Republican primary vote on average. No other potential Republican candidate is in double digits.\n\nThere are very few candidates, of either party, in nonincumbent races who were near or north of 50% in the national primary polls this early on. Those included Republicans Bob Dole in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000, and Democrats Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. All of those candidates won their party’s nominations, and none of those races were particularly close.\n\nInterestingly, all the legal controversies involving Trump have not hurt him in the polls. At the beginning of the year, Trump was earning a little more than 40% of the vote, on average, and was only about 10 points ahead of DeSantis. Trump’s lead is now triple that at closer to 30 points, on average.\n\nYou can read more about the polls here.\n\nThe first reaction to Tuesday’s unprecedented verdict finding a former president and current White House candidate liable for sexual abuse offered no reason to suggest that Donald Trump’s position as the frontrunner for the GOP nomination is under any immediate threat.\n\nBut some of his GOP critics raised questions about his fitness for office that are certain to be at the center of the next general election if he is the Republican nominee.\n\nThe unanimous verdict could deepen his vulnerability among key voting groups, including women – among whom the GOP needs to improve to win back the White House.\n\nThe jury found Trump sexually abused former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll in a New York Department store in 1996 and that he was liable for battery and defamation, while awarding her $5 million. The unanimous jury verdict was vindication for Carroll and offered a symbolic win for other women who have made assault allegations against the president. Trump, who has denied all wrongdoing, immediately denounced the trial as a witch hunt and said he didn’t even know Carroll. He said later Tuesday evening that he will appeal.\n\nFor most of modern US history and for most candidates, Tuesday’s developments would raise potentially insurmountable questions of viability. Many White House hopefuls have exited presidential races for less. And Trump, who’s pleaded not guilty in a separate criminal case involving hush money payments to an adult film star in New York, is facing multiple legal threats. He’s waiting to see whether he will be indicted in separate probes into his attempt to overthrow the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents. But the fact that Trump won’t quit the GOP race – and no one will make him – shows his dominance of the Republican Party, and how he redefined behavioral expectations for public life.\n\nRead the full analysis here.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/17/us/politics/trump-rally-arizona.html', 'Headline': ""On the Scene: Trump's Latest Rally - The New York Times"", 'Snippet': 'At the first Trump rally since President Biden accused his predecessor of holding “a dagger at the throat of America,” the conservative outrage at the current president was palpable.', 'Full_text': 'At the first Trump rally since President Biden accused his predecessor of holding “a dagger at the throat of America,” the conservative outrage at the current president was palpable.\n\nHere’s what I saw on the festival grounds in Arizona this weekend →\n\nOn the Scene: Trump’s Latest Rally\n\nI spotted just as many anti-Biden banners as American flags or pro-Trump banners.

If his favored candidates fare well, he will tighten his stranglehold on the GOP and improve his chances of winning in 2024.\n\nArizona is ground zero for both missions.\n\n""This is maybe the most important election we\'ve ever had, but I do believe 2024 will be even more important,"" Trump told several thousand supporters at a music venue. ""This is the year we are going to take back the House, we are going to take back the Senate and we are going to take back America. And in 2024, we are going to take back the White House.""\n\nArizona is the state he lost by the narrowest margin in 2020, less than 10,500 votes. And his undercard Saturday night featured a blizzard of Trump-styled radicals — all of them election deniers — who hope to purge establishment figures from the party and take control of state and federal elections.\n\nThey included three House members — Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko — who voted against certifying President Joe Biden\'s 2020 election victory; Mark Finchem, a candidate for secretary of state who has associated himself with QAnon; and Kari Lake, a candidate for governor who said Saturday that she wants to imprison state officials who conducted the 2020 election.\n\nGosar, who was in contact with the organizers of the Jan. 6 ""Stop the Steal"" rally, called himself ""the most dangerous man"" in Congress in a warmup speech.\n\nAs if to ensure that he couldn\'t be out-Trumped at his own rally, the former president questioned whether the FBI helped stage the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol — a favorite fabrication of Fox News host Tucker Carlson — and suggested an upside-down equivalency between a Capitol Police officer and the rioter he shot.\n\n""Exactly how many of those present at the Capitol complex on Jan. 6 were FBI confidential informants, agents or otherwise working directly or indirectly with an agency of the United States government?"" Trump asked.\n\nOnly minutes earlier, he said Lt. Michael Byrd shot Ashli Babbitt, who was trying to enter the House speaker\'s lobby through a broken window, ""for no reason.""\n\n""Let\'s see how he could do without the protections that he got,"" Trump said. ""If that happened the other way around, they\'ll be calling \'Let\'s bring back the electric chair.\' ... He\'s a disgrace the way he shot Ashli.""\n\nThe combination put Trump firmly on Babbitt\'s side but against an attack that he incited and she participated in. The crowd didn\'t seem to care much about the logic. Trump was cheered intermittently between chants of ""Let\'s Go Brandon,"" ""F--- Joe Biden"" and ""Lock him up!"" — the latter a reference to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nMike McNulty, 66, a teacher from Phoenix, tore into Fauci in an interview before Trump spoke, comparing him to the Nazi ""Angel of Death,"" Josef Mengele, who performed inhumane and fatal experiments on prisoners at the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\n""Fauci\'s worse than Mengele,"" McNulty said, adding that Trump is ""probably a walking dead man"" because he has been vaccinated. Still, McNulty said he\'ll back Trump if he survives the vaccine.\n\nMany of Trump\'s supporters began leaving before he stopped lying. But that had more to do with the concern about thousands of people departing at the same time down a long two-lane feeder road than a lack of enthusiasm for him.\n\nRosetta Murphy, 60, traveled from Albany, Oregon, more than 1,000 miles away, to see Trump. Like the speakers Saturday night, she said Trump was robbed in 2020.\n\n""It was stolen, definitely stolen,"" she said. ""Everybody loves Trump.""\n\nBertha Lopez, 61, of Florence, didn\'t have to go very far to attend the rally. But she was no less excited about Trump and his prospects for 2024. She said there\'s no one else in the GOP she\'s interested in seeing run.\n\n""Hell no — just him,"" Lopez said. ""I\'m not a traitor. I\'m here for Trump.""\n\nSo was MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a close Trump friend who has been peddling false claims that voting machines were rigged. Dominion, a company that makes voting machines, has filed a $1.3 billion defamation suit against him.\n\nAt the same time, Lindell is suing to block the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack from obtaining his phone records. Asked whether he had had any discussions with the panel, Lindell quickly pivoted.\n\n""I think you should be more worried about things in our country that matter, like the next election and getting rid of the machines, Dominion,"" he said.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/dec/21/donald-trump-rally-spotlighted-biden-trump/', 'Headline': 'PolitiFact | Donald Trump’s rally spotlighted the Biden, Trump ...', 'Snippet': 'However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.

That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.', 'Full_text': 'Before former President Donald Trump spoke for 90 minutes in Durham, New Hampshire, his team compared Trump’s record with President Joe Biden’s record by projecting a series of statistics on the wall.\n\nThe images shown Dec. 16 had the tagline ""Better off with Trump"" and covered mortgage payments, mortgage rates and inflation.\n\nHere’s a fact-check of three statements. The Trump campaign did not answer an inquiry for this article.\n\nSome of the statistics cited on projections at Donald Trump’s rally Dec. 16, 2023, in Durham, N.H. (Rebecca Catalanello/PolitiFact)\n\n""Under Joe Biden, we’ve had a three-year inflation rate of 20%.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe standard inflation measure, the consumer price index, has risen by 17.2% since January 2021, when Biden took office. That was an increase over three years, so the annual inflation rate was lower — about 5.9% per year during Biden’s presidency.\n\nRising wages have helped consumers manage some of this increase in prices.\n\nA standard wage measure, average hourly earnings of all private-sector employees, has risen by 14% during Biden’s presidency, or about 4.8% per year. That means wages are still trailing inflation by about 1.1% a year, but it’s a smaller gap than Trump’s headline number.\n\nThe time frame for the calculation also matters.\n\nAs inflation has cooled over the past year, wage gains have narrowed the cumulative shortfall from inflation. Since November 2022, inflation has risen by 3.1%, but wages have risen by 4%. If the pattern holds, wage growth during Biden’s presidency may soon surpass the increase in prices.\n\nAlso, Americans are in a better place than they were on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, which started during Trump’s last year in office. Since February 2020, the last full month before the pandemic hit, inflation has increased by 18.8%, while wages have increased by 19.4%.\n\n""After three years of Bidenomics, the 30-year mortgage rate has hit a 22-year high.""\n\nThis is Mostly True. Numerically, Trump is on target. However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage peaked at 7.79% on Oct. 26, 2023. That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.\n\nMortgage rates have spiked because the Federal Reserve in March 2022 began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Fed interest rate hikes are considered the most effective economic tools for curbing inflation, because they tend to cool the economy, which eases demand and lowers prices.\n\nSince the Fed hikes began, inflation has receded by about two-thirds. But a side effect has been that other types of interest rates — including mortgages — have also risen.\n\nSince the mortgage rate peak in October, the average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has fallen, hitting 6.67% on Dec. 21. Not counting the peak in recent months, that’s still higher than any rate going back to Aug. 2, 2007, when the rate was 6.68%.\n\nEconomists generally agree that some of Biden’s policies likely added to the pressures that pushed up prices.\n\nBiden’s coronavirus relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, put stimulus money into Americans’ hands when supply chains couldn’t produce enough goods to fulfill consumer demand. This worsened the rise of prices, which started because of pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions.\n\nHowever, ""the drivers of this inflation go back to COVID-19 — issues like supply-chain constraints, workforce shortages, and other factors,"" John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, told PolitiFact West Virginia in October. ""That is much larger than any particular Biden policy.""\n\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said Biden should ""assume some responsibility, but so should members of Congress who voted in favor of stimulus payments, tax cuts, generous unemployment benefits, aid to states and private businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic recession.""\n\nThe American Rescue Plan got no Republican support in Congress, but earlier pandemic relief bills Trump signed were passed with bipartisan support.\n\n""The average monthly mortgage payment: Under Trump, $1,746; Under Biden: $3,322.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThese are the figures for average monthly payments on a new home, real estate company CBRE reports.

Throughout the rally, Mr Trump raged against his enemies as much in the Republican Party as well as President Joe Biden and the media.\n\nHere’s five takeaways from Mr Trump’s event in Arizona.\n\nTrump still runs the GOP\n\nKari Lake, a former Arizona news anchor and gubernatorial candidate, gave one of the rally’s opening speeches and joined Mr Trump onstage.\n\nBefore the former president arrived in Arizona, Kimberly Yee, the Republican state treasurer and also a candidate for governor, announced she would end her campaign and instead would run for state treasurer. Mr Trump also railed against Arizona’s outgoing Republican Governor Doug Ducey, whom he has loathed for not decertifying the 2020 election results.\n\n“He’s never going to get my endorsement,” he said, amid rumors Mr Ducey is considering a run for the Senate against Democratic Senator Mark Kelly.\n\nMr Trump also danced on the graves of retiring Republicans who voted to impeach him for inciting the US Capitol riot on January 6, most recently Rep John Katko of New York. He vocally criticized Reps Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, both of whom sit on the select committee investigating the riot and the latter of whom is not seeking reelection.\n\n“They’re falling fast and furious. We’re getting rid of them fast,” he said.\n\nThe ‘Big Lie’ is now an article of faith\n\nMr Trump opened the rally by saying “The Big Lie is a lot of bulls***.”\n\nThroughout he spoke of how he won the election and continued to spread repeated lies on the 2020 presidential race to thunderous applause.\n\n“I ran twice and we won twice and we did better the second time. We did much better the second time,” Mr Trump said.\n\nHe also dismissed concerns about the January 6 attempted insurrection by his supporters and instead continued to repeat claims of impropriety and that Democrats used measures during the pandemic to enable mail-in voting to steal the election.\n\n“Why aren’t they investigating November 3rd a Rigged and Stolen Election,” he said. “The people are very angry. They got duped and they found out what happened. The people have to be free to find the answers and if not, they will never trust again and our country will be absolutely decimated.”\n\nTrump openly espoused conspiracy theories about January 6 and sympathy for rioters\n\nThe former president has long promoted conspiracy theories unrelated to the election. But throughout the rally, Mr Trump openly espoused the conspiracy theory that Ray Epps - previously on the FBI’s most wanted list - was a government informant and goaded people to come into the Capitol.\n\n“Exactly how many of those present at the Capitol complex on January 6 were FBI confidential informants, agents or otherwise, working directly or indirectly with an agency of the United States government,” he said. “People want to hear this.\n\nHe also expressed sympathy for some rioters who are currently in jail awaiting trial for their actions at the US Capitol and said they are “living in hell.”\n\n“The bathrooms are horrible,” he said, adding that “If we think they’re innocent, we should help them defend themselves.”\n\nHe also repeated his sympathy for Ashli Babbitt, the pro-Trump rioter who was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer after she stormed the building.\n\nLetitia James is target #1, even above Biden\n\nOne target of Mr Trump’s ire stood out from all the rest on Saturday, thanks to the former president’s social media and graphics teams.\n\nThe nearly two-hour rally was interrupted about halfway through for a pre-produced video that the former president showed his fans. In the video, which was up for less than a minute, statements made by New York Attorney General Letitia James about her desire to go after Mr Trump for longstanding accusations of fraud were highlighted.\n\nThe moment stood out, as it marked the only time in the rally that Mr Trump relinquished the microphone other than to allow remarks from Kari Lake, his favoured candidate for Arizona governor.\n\nMs James was also the only one of Mr Trump’s Democratic rivals, including Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, to get the pre-produced attack video treatment.\n\nThe New York Attorney General is currently involved in a case pursuing the Trump Organization for fraud claims.\n\nImpeachment supporters are still on Trump’s mind\n\nNormally, it would make little sense for a president to call out a retiring, low-profile GOP congressman by name and bring him on onstage at a rally located on the opposite side of the country from their home district.\n\nBut typical logic rarely applies to Trump rallies. On Saturday, Mr Trump named and shamed Representative John Katko, a Republican from New York, over his announcement that he would retire and not seek reelection this year.\n\nThe move would normally be seen as a blow for the Republican Party, which hopes to retain control of Mr Katko’s district (which leans slightly Democratic) and retake the House this fall.\n\nBut not so for Mr Trump, de facto leader of the GOP, who sees Mr Katko as the enemy following the latter’s support for the second impeachment of the former president last year in the wake of the January 6 riot.\n\n“They’re falling fast and furious. The ones that voted to impeach, we’re getting rid of them fast,” he told his supporters.\n\nNaming the New York congressman, he added: “And John Katko is now gone, we just got rid of Katko.”\n\nThe announcement was met with a smattering of applause. However the majority of the crowd appeared not to associate the name with the effort to impeach Mr Trump, as it did with bigger-name Republicans like Reps Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nThe president’s second impeachment trial ended without conviction but nevertheless saw the greatest defection by a president’s party of any impeachment effort in history.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/01/trump-arizona-rally-2024-election/621244/', 'Headline': 'Trump Soft-Launches His 2024 Campaign - The Atlantic', 'Snippet': 'Tonight’s rally was Trump’s first public event since July. On paper, the gathering was meant as his response to the anniversary of January 6, as well as an unofficial kickoff for his efforts ...', 'Full_text': 'FLORENCE, Ariz.—Tonight, deep in the Arizona desert, thousands of people chanted for Donald Trump. They had braved the wind for hours—some waited the entire day—just to get a glimpse of the defeated former president. And when he finally appeared on stage, as Lee Greenwood played from the loudspeakers, the crowd roared as though Trump were still the commander in chief. To many of them, he is.\n\n“I ran twice and we won twice,” Trump told his fans. “This crowd is a massive symbol of what took place, because people are hungry for the truth. They want their country back.”\n\nTonight’s rally was Trump’s first public event since July. On paper, the gathering was meant as his response to the anniversary of January 6, as well as an unofficial kickoff for his efforts to support Republicans in the midterm elections. But the event also served as the soft launch of Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. Although he didn’t say the words, the former president seems poised to run in two years—“Make America great again again … again,” he joked to the crowd—and tonight, his message was as clear as it was dishonest: He didn’t lose to Joe Biden in 2020, and he’ll spend the next year working to elect Republicans who agree.\n\nTrump chose Arizona for this moment for a reason. In this state, the Big Lie thrives. Trump lost Arizona by only 10,000 votes in 2020, giving him and his supporters the space, apparently, to allege that the close outcome was the result of left-wing chicanery, the result of ballot stuffing and interference by Venezuelans, among other false claims. State lawmakers who spent the past year reviewing the ballots ultimately found zero evidence of mischief. But that didn’t matter to Trump’s supporters. GOP politicians across Arizona adopted Trump’s lies anyway. Many of them were guests of honor tonight.\n\nThe pre-Trump headliner was Kari Lake, the former TV-news reporter running to replace Governor Doug Ducey; she alleges, falsely, that “bag loads of ballots” were dumped in Arizona last year. (“Kari Lake, she’s been with us from the beginning on the election fraud,” Trump gushed when he brought her back on stage for a cameo during his speech.) Other speakers included secretary-of-state candidate Mark Finchem, who was at the Capitol last January 6 and who often wears a cowboy hat and bolo tie despite being from Michigan; Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs, and Debbie Lesko, three Trump-loving members of Congress who voted against certifying Biden’s win in 2020; and Arizona GOP chair Kelli Ward, who has embraced numerous conspiracy theories and recently received a cease-and-desist notice from Dominion Voting Systems after accusing the company of changing 6,000 Trump votes to Biden votes. Each of these Republicans has repeatedly echoed Trump’s false allegations of election mischief. Of course they have. This is the former president’s new litmus test: You endorse the lie; he endorses you.\n\nNearly everyone I interviewed at the rally vowed to follow Trump’s lead and support only GOP candidates who endorse the false idea that he won the election. “I watched all those Republican candidates in Arizona right now covering it up,” Julie Stohldrier, who drove in with her sister, Amy, told me. “They’re all talk and no action.” Lake is promising action, so the sisters adore her. The pair would love for Trump to run again in 2024, but they don’t think he will, and they’re not sure he’ll need to: They’re confident that he’ll be reinstated as president sometime soon, after Arizona and other states vote to decertify the election. “I want Trump back now,” Amy told me. “I can’t do another three years of this.”\n\nThe Stohldriers’ predictions might seem bold, but the sisters were simply echoing what they’d been hearing from prominent Republicans at the rally. Earlier that afternoon, Ward, the state party chair, had warmed up the crowd by promising that the 2020 election results would soon be overturned. By the latter half of the night, Lake was calling for the arrests of anyone involved in the “shady, shoddy election of 2020.”\n\nEverything we know about fundamentals of midterm elections suggests that Republicans will have an excellent 2022. If Lake and the other Big Lie proponents at tonight’s rally can win their primary races, they’ve got a good shot at becoming the Grand Canyon State’s next generation of political leaders. Even with power, though, they’ll still owe Trump a debt of loyalty—one that he’ll expect to be repaid. “Kari will be incredible for election integrity,” Trump said of Lake, just after vowing to turn on her if she didn’t do “a great job.” Election integrity, he added, might be Lake’s “No. 1 issue.”\n\nAn hour or so into his speech, Trump turned his attention to January 6, calling the storming of the Capitol an excuse for Democrats to arrest people and abuse them in jail. He mocked the police officer who shot Ashli Babbitt, and the crowd cheered. He suggested that the FBI planted people in the crowd outside the Capitol to incite the riot. “The real insurrection took place on Election Day, November 3,” he added.\n\nTrump has been broadcasting these messages for more than a year now. The difference is, what he says hasn’t quite permeated the public consciousness the same way it once did. Trump is no longer the president, and he’s been permanently banned from Twitter, which means that his accusations of fraud and tirades against insufficiently loyal Republicans have had to be expressed via emailed press releases. In this way, the former president has been off the grid.\n\nTrump has still been speaking directly to his most dutiful supporters through far-right media outlets, though. (“He’s tan, fit, has lost some weight since he left office,” Newsmax’s anchors, speculating eagerly about a 2024 announcement, trilled as Trump took the stage here. “People forget that The Apprentice was the No. 1 show on NBC.”) Now that the midterm season is fully under way, Trump will be out and about more often, hosting rallies and stumping for any Republicans desperate enough to lie about the election in exchange for his support. He will in some ways be reintroducing himself to the country: Here I am, America, back after a stolen election, ready to win by any means possible.\n\nI asked a group of older attendees if they were excited to see Trump run again in 2024. They all were. Two of them argued about whether he could take office before 2025. “It’s not possible,” a retiree named Michael, who declined to give his last name, said. “I think it is!” a retiree named Susan Higgins said. “The military has to come in and take [Biden] away.”\n\nBy the end of the evening, Trump was having trouble pretending that he wasn’t actively running for president. He previewed his lines of attack on Biden over Afghanistan, immigration, and inflation; recited a litany of policy changes that a Republican-controlled Congress would be able to make; and promised that “in 2024, we are going to take back the White House.” Sam and Dave’s “Hold on I’m Coming” played as he exited, and the song sounded like a promise.\n\nTrump has had a remarkable 14 months. Most losing presidential candidates are forced into quiet retirement by their parties. Trump has bucked the trend, only tightening his grip on the GOP in the wake of his defeat. He has convinced Republican candidates all over the country—including those on stage tonight—to repeat his election lies, and convinced his rank-and-file supporters to treat those falsehoods as holy writ. By this point, those lies have been circulating for what feels like forever. But at tonight’s rally, as Trump’s fans called for the arrests of poll workers and the reinstatement of the rightful president, I got the sense that this might be just the beginning.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/politics/arizona-trump-rally-2022-election/index.html', 'Headline': 'Trump campaigns for Arizona election deniers in a state that will test ...', 'Snippet': 'Trump, who repeatedly targeted Arizona’s term-limited GOP Gov. Doug Ducey for rebuffing his entreaties to overturn Biden’s victory in Arizona, has heartily embraced Lake’s candidacy.', 'Full_text': 'There is perhaps nowhere in the country where former President Donald Trump had more success elevating his slate of “Make American Great Again” candidates into formidable 2022 contenders than Arizona, a state he narrowly lost in 2020 where he has relentlessly sought to overturn the presidential election results.\n\nWith less than a month until Election Day, Trump campaigned in Mesa on Sunday with those hand-selected GOP candidates vying for the top offices in the state: Gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake, US Senate nominee Blake Masters and Secretary of State nominee Mark Finchem.\n\nAll three rose to the top of their fields during the primary contests – in a state where Trump acolytes have asserted their control over the Republican Party – by echoing Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election to varying degrees.\n\nThat has made Arizona the most closely watched laboratory for democracy in the midterm contests, as Trump weighs another presidential run in 2024, setting up a fresh test of the nation’s election apparatus and the strength of democratic institutions.\n\nIn the near-term, the Senate race could be pivotal to control of the chamber in 2023. But looking forward, Arizona’s status as a battleground state means it could determine the next occupant of the White House, which is why the Democratic opponents of Lake and Finchem – along with Wyoming GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the House select committee probing January 6, 2021 – have warned that their ascent to the state’s highest offices could lead to meddling with the 2024 election results, creating what Cheney recently framed as a test of the “future functioning of our constitutional republic.” In Arizona, the secretary of state is second in line to the governorship.\n\nOn Sunday night, Trump called on Arizona to produce a “clean sweep of every statewide office for the Republican Party” in November.\n\n“You can prove that Arizona is still a red state, and you are,” Trump said, during a speech where he once again falsely claimed he won Arizona in 2020.\n\nThe former President also waded into the abortion debate, reiterating that he favors exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, but also stating that he favors a ban at 15 weeks, a version of which Arizona’s GOP governor has signed, and bringing the issue “back into the states.”\n\nNationally, the question of where limits should be set on abortion has divided the GOP, particularly after South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham proposed a 15-week national ban.\n\nDemocrats hope the debate will weigh in their favor in November since many independent and moderate voters who opposed the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade believe the most restrictive state measures are too extreme. But Trump’s comments on Sunday night may offer some cover for Republican candidates who were struggling to articulate their stance.\n\nThree competitive races\n\nTrump offered glowing praise for Lake, and when he invited her on stage to speak, she managed to create her own moment by telling the crowd that she’s defied “know-nothing consultants” who have advised her to distance from Trump to win her race in a purple state.\n\n“Wouldn’t it be horrible? What would it say about my character if I stepped away from my friends?” Lake said. “If I step away from my friends, that means I would step away from you and I will never step away from the people of Arizona.”\n\n“So, for those know-nothing consultants and the media, I want to show you what it looks like when I step away from President Trump,” she continued, then theatrically hugged him in front of the cameras.\n\nLake, Masters and Finchem are all in tight contests for the seats they are seeking, according to new CNN polling in the Grand Canyon state.\n\nThey are benefiting in part from the fact that a plurality of Arizona voters are registered as Republicans, but also from the fact that election denialism does not rank as the top concern for the state’s voters as they grapple with the impact of inflation, high gas prices and economic turbulence in a climate that should favor the GOP.\n\nThere is no clear leader in the gubernatorial race between Lake and Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who gained national prominence by opposing the efforts of Trump-aligned GOP lawmakers in Arizona to repeatedly wage partisan audits and challenge the 2020 election results. (There is no evidence of widespread election fraud, and the so-called audit confirmed Biden’s victory.) About 49% of likely voters backed Hobbs, while 46% backed Lake in CNN’s new poll.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly is narrowly leading Masters 51% to 45% among likely voters in the Senate race; and there is no clear leader in the race between Finchem and Democrat Adrian Fontes, the former recorder of Maricopa County who was defeated in his 2020 reelection bid after facing criticism for some of the changes he made to the county’s voting systems.\n\nTrump, who repeatedly targeted Arizona’s term-limited GOP Gov. Doug Ducey for rebuffing his entreaties to overturn Biden’s victory in Arizona, has heartily embraced Lake’s candidacy. The former Arizona news anchor, who has repeatedly referred to the 2020 election as “stolen” and “corrupt,” has raised money at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida. During a GOP primary debate this year, she said she would not have certified the 2020 presidential election results in Arizona as Ducey did (and as is required by law).\n\nDucey declined national Republicans’ efforts to get him to run for Senate this year, leaving a crowded field of candidates jockeying for Trump’s support. Trump eventually backed Masters, who had the support of conservative tech billionaire Peter Thiel in the primary, and had released a campaign video stating he believed Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nBut during an Arizona Senate debate last week where Kelly warned that the “wheels” could “come off our democracy” if candidates like his opponent are elected, Masters modulated his tone on the 2020 election results – part of a clear play by the venture capitalist to appeal to a broader swath of the Arizona electorate. Under questioning from the moderator he conceded that he had not seen evidence of fraud in the 2020 vote counting or election results in a way that would have changed the outcome.\n\nAfter his primary victory in August, he also scrubbed his website of language that included the false claim that the election was stolen.\n\nNeither Lake nor Masters mentioned the 2020 election in their remarks Sunday in Mesa before Trump arrived. But Lake, who is executing a Trump playbook by focusing her efforts on boosting GOP base turnout in Arizona, has not attempted to finesse her stance on the 2020 election as some other Trump-endorsed candidates have.\n\nIn an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday morning after Major Garrett noted that Masters had said he had not seen evidence of problems that would have changed the 2020 outcome, Lake did not directly answer when asked if Biden is the legitimate president.\n\n“I think we have major problems in our election system. And … it goes back to 2000. We had Democrats saying the 2000 election wasn’t fair,” Lake replied, adding that Democrats had raised questions about several subsequent elections. “Nobody called them election deniers. And now, all of a sudden in 2020, Garrett, we don’t have free speech anymore. We can’t speak out against our own elections. All I’m asking for is the ability to speak out. When our government does something wrong, we should be able to speak out against it.”\n\nFinchem is one of at least 11 Republican nominees running for state elections chief who have questioned, rejected or tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nThe state representative co-sponsored legislation with fellow Republican lawmakers in Arizona that would allow them to reject election results and require election workers to hand count ballots instead of using electronic equipment to tabulate results.\n\nHe has also called for decertifying the 2020 election results in three Arizona counties – even though legal experts say there is no legal mechanism to do so.\n\nThis story has been updated with remarks from Trump’s rally.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2022/01/14/trump-rally-arizona-live-updates-florence/6529316001/', 'Headline': 'Trump rally in Arizona: LIVE updates from Florence - azcentral.com', 'Snippet': ""Former President Trump's first rally of 2022 was in Florence, Arizona, where several Republican candidates took the stage as well. ... 9:15 p.m.: Trump uses rally to bash Biden, Ducey."", 'Full_text': 'Former President Donald Trump\'s first rally of 2022 will be in Florence, where several Republican candidates will take the stage as well.\n\nTrump\'s appearance Saturday will be his second in the state since leaving office and underscores his continued importance in GOP circles nearly one year after departing the White House.\n\nFollow coverage of the Trump rally by Republic reporters here throughout the day Saturday.\n\nPAST COVERAGE BY THE REPUBLIC\n\nDEMOCRACY IN DOUBT: Trump, allies pushed to undermine 2020 election\n\nHOW WE GOT HERE: An Arizona election audit timeline\n\nARIZONA ELECTION REVIEW DISCREDITED: \'Results were meaningless\': Analysts say they cannot validate or replicate Cyber Ninjas\' hand count of votes\n\nMARICOPA COUNTY RESPONSE: Cyber Ninjas\' report was misleading, inaccurate and false, county says\n\n10 p.m.: Speech hits mark with Florence crowd\n\nWearing a pink Trump cowboy hat and clutching several ""Let’s Go Brandon” hats, Kaia Sisk of Mesa clung on the former president’s every word.\n\n“I love it,” she said.\n\nFlorence was Sisk’s third Trump rally.\n\n“He’s awesome,” Sisk said. “He is funny.

Doug Ducey and the media to the resounding support of the thousands of diehard supporters at Canyon Moon Ranch.\n\nTrump also renewed his grievances and cast his four years in office as a period of unprecedented prosperity and security.\n\nEarly in his remarks, which ended at 8:51 p.m., Trump cast Biden\'s administration as an unfolding disaster and continued his baseless claims of widespread election fraud in 2020.\n\n""Biden has utterly humiliated our nation,"" Trump said, saying that Russia and China\'s leaders no longer respect or fear America.\n\nTrump said the past year under Biden has been a ""disaster"" but said there would be a good political end to the ""catastrophe"" at the outset of the new year.\n\nThe speech was an updated version of Trump’s usual America-first rhetoric, long on personal boasts and lacking in subtlety.\n\n“The country is being destroyed,” he said, after citing rising inflation and the nation’s disastrous retreat from Afghanistan. “Our country is being totally destroyed.”\n\nTrump called the COVID-19 response under Biden a disaster, from vaccine mandates to testing shortages.\n\n“I’m proud I was the anti-mandate president,” Trump said. “We gave Biden every tool he could want. … He’s incapable.”\n\nTrump kept much of his speech focused on Biden, noting the president’s dismal approval ratings and accusing him of being clueless on tackling the nation’s current problems.\n\nTrump repeated his criticism of former ally Gov. Doug Ducey, a fellow Republican who is mulling a run for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly.\n\n“He’s not going to get my endorsement,” Trump said of Ducey. “Ducey has been a terrible, terrible representative of your state.”\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n8:25 p.m.: Trump denounces prosecution of Jan. 6 rioters\n\nDonald Trump blasted the House of Representatives select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHe called the U.S. prosecution of defendants charged with storming the Capitol an “appalling persecution of political prisoners.”\n\nHe said many of the people at the Capitol were FBI informants, not Trump supporters.\n\nAt the same time, Trump described the supporters he spoke to from the Ellipse, near the White House, on Jan. 6 before the attack on the Capitol as one of the largest crowds he’s ever seen.\n\nTrump called the officer who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt inside the Capitol a “dope.”\n\nTrump pointed to social protests during 2020 and asked why the Department of Justice wasn’t going after people who participated in them. “Why aren’t they doing it to Antifa and Black Lives Matter?” he said.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n7:25 p.m.: Former President Trump takes the stage\n\nAfter more than two hours of speeches by other politicians, Trump took the stage at 7:17 p.m. with Lee Greenwood\'s ""God Bless the USA"" playing.\n\nHis first sentences mentioned a ""rigged election,"" ""The Big Lie is a lot of bullshit"" and ""I ran twice and I won twice.""\n\nHe called Joe Biden, who defeated him in the 2020 election, ""a disaster for this country.""\n\nHe mentioned unseating U.S. Sen.

Her message of cracking down on undocumented immigrants, canceling mask mandates and anti-abortion legislation resonated strongly.\n\n“I love her,” said Evelyn Harless of Mesa. “Everything she said needs to happen … She’s going to get something done for Arizona.”\n\nHarless, who turned 70 last year, had never attended a political rally before coming to Florence Saturday. And while Trump was the headliner, Lake stole her heart.\n\n“She is just true to her word,” she said.\n\nHarless said she thought Lake’s stance on border security was tough and direct. “I like people coming into this country. I just want it done legally,” she said.\n\nJohn LeTourneau of Mesa used the same words to describe his adulation for Lake: “I love her,” he said.\n\nLeTourneau said he will have no trouble voting for her for governor.\n\n“She’s honest, sincere and wants to fix things that are wrong with Arizona,” he said.\n\nHe praised her stance on the border and keeping elections secure. And he said her criticisms of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the president on COVID-19, were welcome.\n\n“Absolutely,” he said. “Fauci is crooked as hell.”\n\nFor Lisa Pray, a soon-to-be-grandma from Dewey, it was Lake’s message of pushing anti-abortion legislation that moved her.\n\nShe said she is proud Lake is willing to push “heartbeat laws” and showed a sonogram picture of her daughter’s new child: “That’s not a fetus. That’s a baby.”\n\nPray said Lake represents Arizona, “she represents us.”\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n7:20 p.m.: Democrats issue statement on Trump rally\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokesperson Adonna Biel released a statement before former President Donald Trump spoke in Florence.\n\n“Let there be no mistake, the Republican Party has surrendered to Donald Trump’s stranglehold and fully embraced him no matter the cost to our democracy or Americans’ lives,"" it read in part.\n\n""Tonight\'s rally will serve as little more than a reminder of the chaos and extremism of today’s Republican Party, and why 81 million Americans rejected Donald Trump in 2020 to elect President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats who have led the fastest economic recovery in history, delivered a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to repair Arizona’s roads and bridges, gotten Americans vaccinated, and helped create over 6 million jobs.”\n\n— Kathy Tulumello\n\n7 p.m.: Kari Lake vows no COVID-19 mandates, calls out migrants, Biden\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake began her speech echoing the theme of some of the other speakers, praising America under Trump and listing its problems under Biden. As did others, she called Trump “president” and slammed the 2020 election as “rotten to the core.”\n\nShe vowed to “close every single loophole that allows them to cheat,” though she didn’t give details.\n\nHer wide-ranging comments touched on COVID-19 mandates that she said “people are no longer willing to put up with.”\n\nClaiming she was up “30 points” or more in polls of voters, Lake said, “There will be no mandates and no lockdowns” with her as governor.\n\nShe also called out migrants without papers. “To the people flooding across our border: When I’m governor, you will be arrested and sent back across the border.”\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how she would do that without federal cooperation, but her comments echoed those at a news conference on border security on Tuesday by state lawmakers and Ken Cuccinelli, a former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official under Trump, who claimed that the “self-defense clause” in the U.S. Constitution allows states to take action even without the federal government in times of invasion.\n\n“We are being invaded, and China is pushing deadly fentanyl through Mexico,” said Lake, who then addressed Biden: “It’s going to stop with me … We do not need your protection, your permission to defend our state.”\n\nShe vowed to finish building Trump’s border wall in Arizona, sparking crowd members to chant, “Build that wall! Build that wall!”\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n6:40 p.m.: Members of Congress, candidates cheer Trump, boo others\n\nThe crowd booed the news media, booed Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and booed election workers. Crowd members may have been Republicans, but they were firmly committed to one man, Donald Trump, and the idea that Biden stole the election from him.\n\nThe politicians who warmed up the crowd for Trump hammered home the points. U.S. House members Debbie Lesko, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar ripped Biden and exhorted the crowd to get ready for the next elections.\n\n“Can you feel the storm building?” Gosar asked.\n\nAnthony Kern, a former state representative who’s running for state Senate and who was in Washington near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, began yelling, “Trump! Trump! Trump!” as the former president’s helicopter descended to the festival grounds shortly after 5:30 p.m. “Welcome to Arizona, Mr. President!”\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2020, Kern and 10 other Arizonans, including state GOP Chair Kelli Ward and Rep. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, signed a document that was sent to Congress with a false avowal that they constituted Arizona’s official vote in the Electoral College.\n\nAll 11 people were listed on the general election ballot as the would-be electors for Trump.\n\nBut Trump had lost Arizona. Ducey had certified the election results in late November. By state statute, the only electors who mattered were those pledged to cast their votes for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as they did Dec. 14, 2020, at noon.\n\nThe document the Republicans signed, obtained from the National Archives last year by the group American Oversight, overlooked that detail.\n\nIt described the “undersigned” as the “duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America from the State of Arizona …”\n\nReferring to complaints that he and those electors should be criminally charged, Kern said the “real criminals are the ones who stole the election.”\n\nSen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff, and Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley, who’s running for Arizona secretary of state, continued that tack.\n\n“We are so blessed to have Donald Trump with us here today. We know the election was stolen,” Rogers said.\n\n“They attacked Donald Trump because he exposed them and their evil deeds!” Finchem said.\n\n— Ray Stern and Richard Ruelas\n\n6:10 p.m.: State senators continue to claim election fraud\n\nState lawmakers Sen. Sonny Borrelli, R-Lake Havasu City, and Sen. Kelly Townsend, R-Mesa, told the crowd to stay committed to the election denial conspiracy, as they would.\n\nBorrelli pushed back on the fact that the belief in widespread election fraud that stole the presidency from Trump in 2020 was a “conspiracy theory.” He said there was indeed a conspiracy, but he claims ""it’s not a theory.”\n\nHe said the problem was “obstructionists” who oversee elections at the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office and in Maricopa County.\n\nTownsend and Borrelli were among 30 current and former Arizona lawmakers who signed a resolution asking for the 2020 election to be handed to Trump or for the election certification to be delayed. Borrelli said that many of his peers in the Arizona House and Senate were behind him and other election deniers and that they were going to “tighten up the loopholes that these commie (expletive) have exploited.”\n\nThe crowd cheered as Borrelli claimed that the “shamestream media” were hiding facts like “ghost voters” he says were found to have voted in Pima County in 2020. Pima County election officials deny there were any widespread problems with the election.\n\nTownsend asked how many in the crowd had volunteered for the 2020 election or the Senate-led audit — dozens or more raised their hands. She reminded them that state Attorney General Mark Brnovich is investigating findings from the Senate-led audit and led people in a chant:\n\n“What do we want? Indictments! When do we want them? Now!”\n\nShe referred to unnamed enemies who are “constantly scheming” to steal elections.\n\n“We want indictments of the election workers so that they don’t continue to do this,” she said before going on to condemn “medical tyranny” she sees in COVID-19 emergency measures.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n5:30 p.m.: Traffic jams delay Trump fans outside venue\n\nTraffic for the Trump rally was backed up for more than an hour outside Country Thunder in Florence. The line to the front gate snaked back and forth and trailed far into a dirt parking lot as people waited.\n\nBobby Parsons of Cottonwood said he and his wife arrived at 1 p.m. and waited for more than three hours and still hadn\'t made it into the main arena. But he didn\'t mind, not at all.\n\nParsons said he loved the energy of the crowd and couldn\'t wait to see Trump. And if there\'s one message he hopes Trump delivers, it is: ""Tell Biden to get the hell out.""\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n5:15 p.m.: Spending time with \'thousands of people who feel the same way\'\n\nTwo Arizona social workers said their biggest reason for attending the Trump rally is concern for their clients. They said the Biden administration’s handling of the economy has put people who need government services at risk.\n\n“I work for the State of Arizona in the Disability Division, said Colette Lofgren of Apache Junction. “So many people have left their jobs at the state that we cannot get services for people.”\n\nThe ""Great Resignation"" has left the agency with such a backlog that workers are struggling to get to them.\n\nHer friend Sandra Wilson of Mesa nodded in agreement. Wilson works for the Department of Child Safety and said the same issues plague her office.\n\nThe women both said the country’s economic situation, with inflation and supply-chain issues, have taken a personal toll.\n\n“I was getting to the age of retirement,” Lofgren said. “There is no way under this administration that I can move forward with my dreams.”\n\nLofgren said a year ago she was preparing to build a home in Mississippi but abandoned those plans as costs rose.\n\n“There was no way I can build a house,” she said.\n\nBoth women said they want to support President Donald Trump, who is the rightful leader of the country.\n\nWilson said she has attended several Trump rallies and enjoys the camaraderie.\n\n“I can be with good friends and be with thousands and thousands of people who feel the same way,” she said.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n4:55 p.m.: Ward: Who won the election? Crowd: Trump\n\nMany — if not most — people in the crowd seemed to believe Trump’s insistence that he really won the election by “a lot.” A year of investigation, numerous courts throwing out lawsuits claiming they had evidence of fraud and the results of the audit authorized by the Arizona Senate did not seem to deter crowd members from their belief.\n\nKelli Ward, chair of the Arizona Republican Party, who took the stage first, made that clear. She gave a brief speech that began by asking the crowd to respond to the question “Who won the election?”\n\n“Trump!” the crowd roared.\n\nSeeming to address concerns by many Republicans about the election system, Ward urged people to “please, please go out and vote.”\n\nWard claimed that “cheating” also occurred in 2016, but “we overwhelmed their cheating algorithm.”\n\n“Get rid of Dominion! Get rid of drop boxes!” she shouted. “Let’s restore integrity to our election.”\n\nMany of the people in the crowd wore colorful costumes, Trump apparel and shirts supporting Trump or Arizona Republican candidates for office such as gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake or U.S. Senate contender Jim Lamon.\n\nThe crowd included many young people and senior citizens, though most in attendance seemed to be middle-aged. The festival atmosphere included food trucks, loudspeakers blaring a mix of country and classic rock, long lines for the portable toilets and a stage with bleachers for VIPs.\n\nDiehard belief in the falsehood that Trump actually won the 2020 election was a strong theme.\n\nTamera Rayl of Tucson, who was hanging out on a blanket with family members, said she believes Biden won through fraud and hopes Arizona lawmakers “get rid of the machines” used in elections and go back to paper ballots that would be hand-counted.\n\nShe believes like-minded Republicans will still be “mad enough” over the 2020 election results to show up at the polls this year despite beliefs that the election system is broken.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n4:45 p.m.: Speaker lineup includes Lake, 3 members of Congress\n\nBesides Trump, speakers were expected to include several politicians who have spread falsehoods about the 2020 election and supported rioters who invaded the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. They include:\n\nU.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nU.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz.\n\nU.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz.\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley.\n\nState Sen. Kelly Townsend, R-Mesa.\n\nState Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff.\n\nKari Lake, candidate for Arizona governor.\n\nAnthony Kern, former state representative and candidate for state Senate.\n\nKelli Ward, chair of the Arizona Republican Party.\n\nAlveda King, 2020 campaign advisory board member.\n\nBoris Epshteyn, Trump strategic adviser and 2020 campaign board member.\n\nMike Lindell, CEO of My Pillow.\n\n“You know what day it is,” a voice said over the loudspeaker at about 4 p.m. “It’s Trump Day! Let’s go, Brandon!”\n\nMany in the crowd responded in kind with the veiled, obscene insult of President Joe Biden.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n3:55 p.m.: Crowd gathers for speeches, rally\n\nThousands of spectators began to gather Saturday afternoon at the Country Thunder festival grounds, with traffic backups on State Route 79. Gates opened at 2 p.m. More than a dozen ATVs lined State Route 79 just before the entrance, waving flags and cheering those lined up in their cars. A single protester stood across from a Mercedes sedan on the entry road to the venue, waving a sign with the United States code on it.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n10:30 a.m.: What\'s on Trump\'s list of talking points?\n\nTrump gave a preview of the Saturday rally that suggests he will continue pushing baseless claims of election fraud.\n\n""Look forward to seeing everyone in Arizona tomorrow! Many topics will be discussed including the Rigged Presidential Election of 2020, the fake Big Lie, the corrupt LameStream Media, the Afghanistan disaster, Inflation, the sudden lack of respect for our Nation and its leaders, and much more,"" Trump said in a written statement Friday. ""Big crowds, will also be covered on TV. See you Saturday evening!""\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\nDEMOCRACY IN DOUBT: Read the series that gets inside the Arizona election review\n\n9 a.m.: Trump takes a shot at Gov. Ducey\n\nHours before his appearance in Florence, Trump took yet another shot at Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who has become a frequent punching bag for the former president ever since Ducey signed off on the 2020 election results.\n\n“Rumors are that Doug Ducey, the weak RINO Governor from Arizona, is being pushed by Old Crow Mitch McConnell to run for the U.S. Senate,” Trump said in a statement. “He will never have my endorsement or the support of MAGA Nation!”\n\nDucey often bristles at any question about whether he will seek the GOP nomination to challenge U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., for his seat later this year.\n\nBut rumors abound nevertheless, in part thanks to high-ranking Republicans in Washington, D.C., including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who are urging establishment Republicans including Ducey to run.\n\nBut Ducey\'s standard reply includes touting his day job as Arizona’s governor and pointing to early 2021, when he said he was not running for the seat. Asked early last week what his future holds after his final year as governor, Ducey said he was focused on leading the state and running the Republican Governors Association, which seeks to elect Republican governors across the country.\n\n“My plate is full,” Ducey told The Arizona Republic. “And I have found in the past, in my career, when I have focused on the work on my desk and done it with excellence, other opportunities present themselves.”\n\nAsked if Ducey would go to Trump’s rally on Saturday, governor’s spokesman C.J. Karamargin said Ducey had “no plans” to attend.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\nFriday afternoon: ReAwaken America Tour leads to police calls at Dream City Church\n\nA conservative forum in Phoenix overlapping Donald Trump\'s return to Arizona opened Friday with calls to police.\n\nAttendees at the ReAwaken America Tour at Dream City Church taunted teachers from the nearby BASIS Phoenix charter school over masks, school officials confirmed.\n\nThe tour, hosted by conservative podcaster Clay Clark and featuring Trump\'s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, is scheduled to run through Saturday.\n\nElection fraud and pandemic conspiracies dominate the itinerary, including a speech titled, ""It’s the COVID-19 Protocols That Are Mass Murdering COVID-19 Patients.""\n\nOther topics include pinpointing where the world is on the Biblical timeline, communicating after the power grid is destroyed and ""Jesus is King & Donald Trump is the REAL president of the United States.""\n\nArizona Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley, state Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff, and Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward are among the scheduled speakers.\n\nA pastor at Dream City Church confirmed about a dozen Phoenix police officers responded to the event Friday and the issue had been ""taken care of.""\n\nHe said ReAwaken America rented space from the church but is not affiliated with the church. He said several armed private security guards were hired by the event.\n\nDream City has hosted a number of conservative events, including a June movie premiere touting 2020 election conspiracies by key operatives in the Arizona Senate\'s largely discredited ballot review.\n\nTrump held a rally at the church in 2020.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\nEarly Friday afternoon: Vendors gear up for Trump rally\n\nDays before Donald Trump\'s rally in Florence, merchandise vendors were staking out highway pullouts and setting up roadside stands more than 20 miles away.\n\nVendors dragged tents, tables and Trump gear from the backs of vehicles beginning Wednesday.\n\nFlags and T-shirts fluttered around canopies in at least three spots within a mile of each other Friday on Hunt Highway just over the Maricopa County line in San Tan Valley.\n\nHunt Highway is one of the central routes for people driving from the East Valley to the Country Thunder venue, where Trump is scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. Saturday.\n\nPassing cars gave the occasional honk as they zoomed past on Friday, earning waves from vendors. ""It\'s going to be good weekend,"" one seller said.\n\n— Robert Anglen'}}",94.72222222222223,1

Trump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has ...', 'Full_text': 'Washington — The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol voted Monday to adopt the final report of its probe, which includes 17 takeaways related to former President Donald Trump\'s efforts to remain in power.\n\nThe committee released a 161-page executive summary of its findings as the clock runs out for lawmakers to complete their work before Republicans take control of the House. The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January. McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt.""'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/jan-6-panel-shutting-down-after-concluding-18-month-investigation', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 panel shutting down after concluding 18-month investigation - PBS', 'Snippet': 'The House Jan. 6 committee is shutting down, having completed a whirlwind 18-month investigation of the 2021 Capitol insurrection and having sent its work to the Justice Department along with a ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The House Jan. 6 committee is shutting down, having completed a whirlwind 18-month investigation of the 2021 Capitol insurrection and having sent its work to the Justice Department along with a recommendation for prosecuting former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe committee’s time officially ends Tuesday when the new Republican-led House is sworn in. With many of the committee’s staff already departed, remaining aides have spent the last two weeks releasing many of the panel’s materials, including its 814-page final report, about 200 transcripts of witness interviews, and documents used to support its conclusions.\n\nLawmakers said they wanted to make their work public to underscore the seriousness of the attack and Trump’s multi-pronged effort to try to overturn the election.\n\n“Accountability is now critical to thwart any other future scheme to overturn an election,” Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., wrote in a departing message on Monday. “We have made a series of criminal referrals, and our system of Justice is responsible for what comes next.”\n\nWATCH: Key member of Jan. 6 committee on recommendation of charges against Trump\n\nSome of the committee’s work — such as videotape of hundreds of witness interviews — will not be made public immediately. The committee is sending those videos and some other committee records to the National Archives, which by law would make them available in 50 years. Members of the committee said they didn’t release that videotape now because it would have been too difficult to edit it and redact sensitive information.\n\nIncoming Republican leaders may try to get those materials much sooner, though. A provision in a package of proposed House rules released Sunday calls for the National Archives to transfer “any records related to the committee” back to the House no later than Jan. 17.\n\nIt is unclear whether the GOP-led House could enforce the provision and what they would do with the materials.\n\nThe committee’s conclusion comes after one of the most aggressive and wide-ranging congressional investigations in recent memory. The panel formally or informally interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, collected more than 1 million documents and held 10 well-watched hearings. The two Republicans and seven Democrats on the panel were able to conduct the investigation with little interference after House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy declined to appoint minority members, angry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had rejected two of his suggested appointments.\n\nIn the end, the panel came to a unanimous conclusion that Trump coordinated a “conspiracy” on multiple levels, pressuring states, federal officials and lawmakers to try to overturn his defeat, and inspired a violent mob of supporters to attack the Capitol and interrupt the certification of President Joe Biden’s win. The panel recommended that the Justice Department prosecute Trump on four crimes, including aiding an insurrection.\n\nREAD MORE: Jan. 6 panel releases final report, alleges Trump engaged in ‘conspiracy’ to overturn election\n\nWhile a so-called criminal referral has no real legal standing, it is a forceful statement by the committee and adds to political pressure already on Attorney General Merrick Garland and special counsel Jack Smith, who is conducting an investigation into Jan. 6 and Trump’s actions.\n\n“This is the most intense investigation I’ve been involved in,” said California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who has been in the House for almost three decades and served as an aide to a member on the House Judiciary Committee in the 1970s when Congress was preparing to impeach then-President Richard Nixon.

Washington — The House select committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol released its long-anticipated final report ...', 'Full_text': 'Washington — The House select committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol released its long-anticipated final report late Thursday night, capping a nearly 18-month investigation that resulted in the historic recommendation that former President Donald Trump be criminally prosecuted for his conduct surrounding the insurrection.\n\nThe panel wrote that the evidence presented over the course of its hearings of ""a multi-part plan"" to overturn the 2020 election ""led to an overriding and straightforward conclusion: the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, whom many others followed.""\n\n""None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him,"" the committee concluded.\n\nThe 814-page report devotes nearly 400 pages to a narrative that places the blame for the Capitol riot squarely on Trump, beginning with a chapter called ""The Big Lie."" Here, the committee sets out to show that Trump planned even before the 2020 presidential election to declare prematurely that he had won. It quotes testimony by his campaign team in which they informed Trump that he had lost the election and that there had been no fraud.\n\nThe narrative walks through Trump\'s alleged post-election efforts to retain power, including attempts to replace slates of electors with fake alternate electors who would support him, alleged efforts to subvert the Justice Department by replacing officials who refused to make false statements that would help Trump remain in power and plans to stop Congress\' certification of the election on Jan. 6.\n\nRead the full final Jan. 6 House select committee report here\n\nThe report also lists 11 recommendations to prevent another Jan. 6. Among them: barring Trump from holding any federal or state office in the future and the passage of the Electoral Count Act to clarify the vice president\'s and Congress\' narrow roles in the presidential election and to make it more difficult to overturn the results.\n\nThe committee points out that the Constitution says individuals can be disqualified from holding public office if they ""engaged in an insurrection"" or gave ""aid or comfort"" to one.\n\nThe committee on Wednesday also began releasing transcripts from the months of testimony gathered, starting with 34 witnesses\' interviews. Those witnesses included Jeffrey Clark, John Eastman, Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, Nick Fuentes, Alex Jones, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Arizona Republican Party chairwoman Kelli Ward. In addition to recommending charges against Trump, the committee also recommended charges against Eastman, a law professor who proposed having Vice President Mike Pence refuse to count the electoral ballots of certain states that had voted for Joe Biden.\n\nThe transcripts confirmed many of the witnesses invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, including to questions about biographical details. Stone, for example, asserted his Fifth Amendment rights when asked where he resides and his age.\n\nLawyers for Clark, a former Justice Department official who the committee said ""stands out as a participant"" in an alleged conspiracy to defraud the United States, responded to the report with a statement Thursday night attacking the committee. They called it a ""political and public-relations bust"" and said, ""This is why, on its way out the door, the Committee is desperately trying to make a splash with criminal referrals it was obvious from the very start its members were going to make in an effort to try to destroy their conservative political opponents.""\n\nOn Thursday, the panel made public two transcripts from September interviews with Cassidy Hutchinson, a former top aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Hutchison testified before the committee in an explosive public hearing in late June, during which she discussed Trump\'s repeated demands to go to the Capitol on Jan. 6 and an interaction she learned of between the former president and the head of his security detail in a presidential vehicle after his speech on the Ellipse, which involved Trump allegedly lunging toward him when he was told he could not go to the Capitol.\n\nLater Thursday, the committee release the transcripts of interviews with former Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency Director Chris Krebs; Capitol rioter Stephen Ayres (Part 1, Part 2); former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, former Justice Department official Ken Klukowski (June 10, 2022), who was an aide to another Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark; and former special assistant to the president Sarah Matthew.\n\nThe committee published introductory materials to the report earlier this week, which included the committee\'s criminal referrals to the Justice Department for possible prosecution and 17 key findings from its investigation.\n\nThe panel recommended the Justice Department pursue at least four criminal charges against former President Donald Trump related to his alleged efforts to thwart the transfer of presidential power: obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement and incitement, rebellion or insurrection.\n\nDuring the course of its probe, the select committee held 10 public hearings, conducted interviews with more than 1,000 witnesses and collected more than 1 million pages of material. It issued subpoenas to Trump and some of his closest allies, though ultimately did not speak with the former president or former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe committee\'s hearings, the bulk of which were held over the summer, focused on what investigators said was a multi-part plan by Trump and his allies to reverse the results of the 2020 presidential election and keep the former president in office. The pressure campaign involved Pence, state lawmakers, election officials and the Justice Department, and culminated in the Jan. 6 attack, during which a mob of Trump\'s supporters breached the Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from re-affirming President Biden\'s electoral win, the panel alleged.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California and a member of the committee, told ""CBS Mornings"" on Wednesday that the decision to refer Trump for possible criminal charges was a ""somber decision to make, and not one we made lightly.""\n\n""We believe that with respect to inciting an insurrection and conspiracy to defraud and obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to lie ... that Donald Trump committed all of these offenses,"" Schiff said. ""And as the Congress itself was the victim of some of them, our democracy, all of them, that we had an obligation to report what we knew to the Justice Department.""\n\nTrump, who has launched a 2024 presidential bid, has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt."" He called the criminal referrals ""Fake charges made by the highly partisan Unselect Committee of January 6th"" in response to the release of the introductory materials earlier this week.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/jan-6-committee-public-meeting/index.html', 'Headline': 'Live updates: Jan. 6 committee votes to issue criminal referrals ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The Jan. 6 committee voted to approve its final report and the referral of multiple criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ during the panel’s final public meeting Monday.', 'Full_text': 'These are the key takeaways from the Jan. 6 committee\'s final public session\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee used its final public meeting Monday to summarize its 17-month investigation with a simple closing statement: All roads lead to Donald Trump.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\n\nThe committee refers Trump to the DOJ\n\nFor months, the committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. On Monday, the committee didn’t equivocate.\n\nThe committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary, released after the meeting, it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nIn practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nBut the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department’s court.\n\nAll roads lead to Trump\n\nCommittee members repeatedly pointed to Trump’s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6.\n\nMonday’s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break “the foundation of American democracy.” Members stressed that Trump knew the election was not stolen but continued to push baseless claims about widespread voter fraud in an effort to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory.\n\nVisually reinforcing their argument\n\nThe committee relied once again on video — an effective and memorable tool the panel has used throughout its hearings with closed-door witness testimony and harrowing scenes from the violent attack on the Capitol, to make an its case against Trump.\n\nThe montage went step-by-step through Trump’s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters.\n\nA bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor\n\nThough GOP lawmakers have called the committee partisan, the panel is, in fact, bipartisan.\n\nTwo Republicans who volunteered to join the committee: Rep. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. They both brought GOP staff members along with them who worked for the committee.\n\nTo be sure, Cheney and Kinzinger are outliers in their caucus because they are anti-Trump. And that is the core of Trump’s critiques of the committee — that it stacked with Trump haters. Still, even if they oppose Trump, Cheney and Kinzinger are still deeply conservative Republicans.\n\nNo matter what Trump and his allies say, Democrats will forever be able to accurately assert that the panel’s findings, conclusions, its final report and its criminal referrals are bipartisan.\n\nRead more takeaways here\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee had its last public meeting today. Here\'s what happens next.\n\nThe end is near — at least for the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nThe panel held its final public session Monday where it voted on its final report and approved a criminal referral for several charges against former President Donald Trump.\n\nSo here’s what happens next: Committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the full report will come out Wednesday. This will be a historical document that will be studied for generations — never before has a sitting president tried to steal a second term.\n\nAdditional “transcripts and documents” will be released before the end of the year, Thompson said.\n\nThe sheer volume of this material can’t be overstated. The panel interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, likely generating tens of thousands of pages of transcripts. Many of these interviews were filmed, which means the panel has hundreds of hours of footage that it might release very soon.\n\nThese upcoming releases will provide fodder to Trump’s critics. But it will also grant a key demand from some of Trump’s allies — that the panel disclose the full context of its interviews. Up until this point, the panel has been very selective about which snippets of witness interviews got played at public hearings.\n\nThe current Congress ends on January 3, 2023, and that’s when the committee will cease to exist. But the Justice Department investigation, overseen by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by US Attorney General Merrick Garland, continues.\n\nOf the committee’s nine members, four won’t be returning to Congress. Besides Republican vice-chair Rep. Liz Cheney and Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida is retiring, and Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia was one of the handful of House Democratic incumbents who lost their seats in the 2022 midterms last month.\n\n""We ended up in the middle"": Rep. Jamie Raskin explains how the committee made criminal referral selections\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who serves on the subcommittee of the Jan. 6 select committee responsible for presenting criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, laid out how panel members arrived at the decisions presented during Monday’s final public session.\n\nAsked about process offenses, such as witness tampering or perjury, Raskin said “as evidence is assembled about that, I hope that those will be charged as well. You cannot suborn perjury, you cannot obstruct justice, you cannot interfere with a congressional proceeding.” However, Raskin did not specify who these potential charges related to in the panel’s investigation.\n\nIn terms of unanswered questions left by the committee, Raskin was asked if the panel ever solved the situation with the pipe bombs on Jan. 6 and said, “I don’t believe there have been any updates since we first looked int to. Those are unsolved crimes.”\n\nIn pictures: Scenes from the last public Jan. 6 committee meeting\n\nCheck out photos from the last Jan. 6 hearings here.\n\nCommittee members Schiff and Raskin explain why more Trump associates were not referred to the DOJ\n\nJan. 6 committee members, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Adam Schiff, explained that more associates of former President Donald Trump were not directly referred to the Department of Justice because the committee wanted to focus on those with “abundant evidence” against them.\n\nRaskin noted that the DOJ will receive the full report and can decide if anyone else discussed merits further investigation.\n\n“We wanted to proceed in such a way that we could all feel certain that these were people where evidence exists that they engaged in criminal offenses against our country,” he added.\n\nSchiff said, “The long and the short of it is we possess evidence that up until this release, the Justice Department may not have, they possess evidence that we don’t have, and the cumulative impact of all that evidence will hopefully lead to justice for those that have broken the law here.”\n\nRaskin promised that they would cooperate with the Justice Department “quickly,” while Schiff added that the committee expects evidence will start to be made available to both the DOJ and the public starting Wednesday.\n\nAsked to explain why those four House Republicans were referred to House Ethics in particular, Schiff pointed out that these four failed to comply with a congressional subpoena, which is easier to prove.\n\nHere\'s a recap of what happened at the Jan. 6 committee\'s final public session\n\nAfter extensive investigation, the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol held its final public meeting Monday where they voted on their final report and approved a series of criminal referrals — including against former President Donald Trump and others in his orbit.\n\nThe final report is expected to be released publicly Wednesday.\n\nHere are the key things that happened at the committee’s last public session:\n\nTrump’s role in the events of Jan. 6: The committee announced it will refer several criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including obstructing an official proceeding, defrauding the United States, making false statements and assisting or aiding an insurrection.The DOJ special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into Jan. 6. The referrals are largely symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes.\n\nFinal report: Members voted to approve their final report, which will include a bulk of results from the 17-month investigation, chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said during his opening remarks. An executive summary of the report was released after Monday’s meeting, but the full report won’t be available to the public until Wednesday.\n\nA spanning investigation: During the meeting, the committee played a video summarizing its investigation. Since its formation in July 2021, the panel conducted more than 1,000 interviews as well as issued subpoenas and court battles to obtain hundreds of thousands of documents. The committee said the evidence shows that Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nClosing remarks from the committee: Though its investigation is coming to a close, Thompson reiterated the importance of preventing another insurrection from happening again, for the sake of American democracy. “I believe nearly two years later, this is still a time of reflection and reckoning,” he said. “If we are to survive as a nation of laws and democracy, this can never happen again.” Thompson said the most important thing in preventing another event like Jan. 6 is accountability. The committee’s vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, said Trump was “unfit for any office.”\n\nOfficers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 were sitting in the front row during committee meeting\n\nAs the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 riot held its last public meeting, the room was packed.\n\nLaw enforcement officers who testified at the panel’s first public hearing last July about the violence they experienced defending the US Capitol on Jan. 6 sat in the front row, as they have for every public event the committee has had.\n\nThose officers include: US Capitol Police (USCP) officer Harry Dunn, former Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, former USCP Sgt. Aquilino Gonell and Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges.\n\nFanone sat in the audience as the panel replayed his testimony about being attacked as the riot unfolded.\n\nA number of committee staff and investigators — and even former GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, who has publicly supported the panel’s work — were in the audience as well.\n\nThe meeting took place in the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caucus Room which was recently renamed to honor House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who stepping down as speaker at the end of the this Congress.\n\nIn previous hearings, it was typical to see a committee staffer sitting at the dais with the members. But for today’s meeting, it was just the nine committee members at the dais, each taking turns speaking.\n\nJan. 6 committee chair says he\'s ""convinced"" Trump will be charged by DOJ with help of panel\'s evidence\n\nJan. 6 committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the evidence that supports the panel’s decision to refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for several criminal charges is “clear,” adding that he is “convinced” that the DOJ will ultimately charge Trump.\n\n“The committee looked at it long and hard, and from my vantage point, we couldn’t do anything except make the referral,” Thompson told CNN after Monday’s meeting, acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the referral.\n\n“It was clear in the evaluation of the evidence uncovered by our committee that those actions taken by the president… former President Trump, clearly created a problem for this country,” he added.\n\nThe committee also voted to approve its final report which will be released to the public Wednesday. That report will contain most of the evidence from the 17-month long investigation — including full transcripts from more than 1,000 interviews.\n\n“We think it’s important for the Justice Department to look at that body of information that we put together,” he said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n1c447b21-7492-487d-bf20-bbd9f8559559.mp4\n\n01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nKellyanne Conway testified that Trump described rioters as ""upset"" the day after the attack\n\nTrump “minimized the seriousness of the attack” in the days following the riot, Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Elaine Luria said, specifically citing testimony that Trump’s former senior adviser Kellyanne Conway gave to the committee.\n\nAsked to describe her conversation with Trump the day after the riot, Conway, said she didn’t think it was very long. “I don’t think it was very long. I just said that was just a terrible day.”\n\nTrump, Conway said, responded to her saying, “These people are upset. They’re very upset.”\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump similarly described rioters as being “upset” during a heated phone call he had with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy while the insurrection was underway, claiming the rioters cared more about the election results than the California Republican did.\n\n“Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,” Trump said, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call afterward by McCarthy.\n\nTrump’s comment set off what GOP lawmakers familiar with the call described as a shouting match between the two men. A furious McCarthy told Trump the rioters were breaking into his office through the windows, and asked, “Who the f–k do you think you are talking to?” according to a Republican lawmaker familiar with the call.\n\nTrump was warned of violence before Jan. 6, but refused to encourage peaceful protest\n\nIn the lead up to Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Donald Trump ignored warnings from advisors about the potential for violence and rejected any suggestion that he should explicitly tell supporters to be peaceful, Rep. Stephanie Murphy said Monday.\n\nMurphy pointed to a text message exchange provided to the committee by Hope Hicks, Trump’s former communications director. In the exchange, Hicks and then White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley discussed getting Trump to tweet out a message to his supporters. Gidley texted Hicks that Trump “really should tweet something about Being NON-violent.”\n\nHicks responded that she had already “suggested it several times” without success.\n\n“Mr. Herschmann said that he had made the same recommendation directly to the President and that he had refused,” Hicks said in her interview with the committee, a video of which was played Monday.\n\nDespite his staff’s warnings, Murphy said, Trump took to the stage on Jan. 6, 2021, and encouraged his supporters to “fight like hell,” and sent them marching to the Capitol building.\n\nNOW: Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral against Trump and other officials\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral it plans to make against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department and other officials.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee would refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the committee, told CNN last week that a subcommittee of members would make recommendations to the full committee about various referrals.\n\nThe full committee is now expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nRemember: A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case. With the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nJan. 6 committee concerned lawyer took part in attempt to keep truth from them, Lofgren says\n\nHouse Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren revealed during Monday’s public meeting that an unnamed lawyer appeared to have attempted to shape the testimony of one witness in a way that could help Donald Trump.\n\nLofgren noted a lawyer suggested that the witness not share some memories during her testimony to the committee, that she couldn’t learn who was paying for her lawyer, and that Trump-allied entities offered to keep her under their wing as her testimony neared.\n\nAs it became clear what the witness would say, Lofgren added, the job offers evaporated.\n\nLofgren didn’t name the lawyer or the female witness, and it’s not clear if all of the examples are about one witness.\n\nIt’s not unusual or illegal for lawyers to take money from motivated backers to pay for witnesses to be represented. But lawyers must follow strict ethics guidelines, governed by their state bars and enforced by the courts. The House select committee previously shared their concerns about potential witness influence with the Justice Department.\n\nFormer Trump aide Hope Hicks describes conversation with Trump saying the only thing that matters is winning\n\nIn a new video clip played by the House Jan. 6 committee, Hope Hicks, who previously served as a top aide to former President Donald Trump, referenced the baseless claims of election fraud and said: “I was becoming increasingly concerned that … we were damaging his legacy.”\n\nTrump “said something along the lines of, you know, ‘Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,’” Hicks said in the clip.\n\nThe committee played the clip after Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren said Trump was repeatedly told there was no evidence to back up his false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, and the panel “has obtained testimony from new witnesses who have come forward to tell us about their conversations with ex-President Trump on this topic.”\n\n“Donald Trump knowingly and corruptly repeated election fraud lies, which incited his supporters to violence on Jan. 6. He continues to repeat his meritless claim that the election was stolen even today, and continues to erode our most cherished and shared belief in free and fair elections,” Lofgren later continued.\n\nKinzinger calls out fellow Republicans for their role in Trump’s DOJ schemes\n\nGOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the two Republicans on the the Jan. 6 committee, accused former president Donald Trump of trying to abuse the powers of the Justice Department so he could stay in office.\n\nKinzinger described how Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to publicly endorse his false claims about massive voter fraud. As part of the plan, Trump wanted them to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,” according to committee testimony.\n\nA retiring Republican, Kinzinger called out his fellow GOP lawmakers. He also specifically name-dropped Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, who was involved with some of Trump’s scheming at the Justice Department.\n\nWhen then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to go along with Trump’s plan, Trump almost fired him and replaced him with Jeffrey Clark, a Trump loyalist at DOJ who embraced his election lies.\n\n“It was only after the threat of mass resignations that President Trump rescinded his offer to Mr. Clark,” Kinzinger said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\ncc4283b8-e6ad-44ea-8cac-93d9dcbf8029.mp4\n\n04:42 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump ""oversaw"" legally dubious fake electors plot, Jan. 6 committee says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump “oversaw” an effort to obtain and transmit false Electoral College certificates, tying him directly to a core tenet of the broader plot to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory in key swing states, the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection said Monday.\n\nThe panel highlighted Trump’s personal involvement in the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost, arguing that the evidence shows he actively worked to “transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives.”\n\nThose certificates, which surfaced publicly earlier this year, helped spark criminal investigations into the Trump team’s attempt to subvert the Electoral College.\n\nAs part of its closing message Monday, the select committee emphasized that these “false ballots” were created despite concerns among Trump’s election lawyers and White House counsel that doing so may be “unlawful.”\n\n“In spite of these concerns, and the concerns of individuals in the White House Counsel’s Office, President Trump and others proceeded with this plan,” he added.\n\nThe committee has evidence that shows these “intentionally false” Electoral College certificates were “transmitted to multiple officers of the federal government,” according to Schiff.\n\nEvidence collected by the committee also shows these documents “were intended to interfere with the proper conduct of the joint session, where the existence of so-called ‘competing slates’ of electors would serve as a pretext for legitimate electoral votes to be rejected,” he added.\n\nCheney: Trump ""is unfit for any office""\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the committee, issued a scathing rebuke of former President Donald Trump during her opening remarks on Monday, saying he is unfit for office based on his actions regarding Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\n“At the beginning of our investigation, we understood that tens of millions of Americans had been persuaded by President Trump that the 2020 election was stolen by overwhelming fraud. And we also knew this was flatly false. We knew that dozens of state and federal judges had addressed and resolved all manner of allegations about the election,” Cheney said. “Our legal system functioned as it should. But our president would not accept the outcome. Among the most shameful of this committee’s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television.”\n\nShe went on to describe how Trump was unmoved by “urgent pleas” from people around him to “issue a public statement instructing his supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol,” even as rioters attacked law enforcement officials and halted the electoral count.\n\n“In addition to being unlawful as described in our report, this was an utter moral failure, and a clear dereliction of duty,” Cheney added.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney: ""At the heart of our Republic is the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power""\n\nGOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection on the US Capitol, said the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power is “at the heart of our Republic.”\n\nShe added: “Trumbull called this ‘one of the highest moral lessons ever given the world.’ With this noble act, George Washington established the indispensable example of the peace transfer of power in our nation.”\n\nShe traced this orderly transfer of power through every president of the United States until former President Donald Trump refused his constitutional duty.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nfb900dba-c57b-4545-9654-1fd8f5848d90.mp4\n\n05:07 - Source: CNN\n\nThompson: It\'s up to the people of America to decide who deserves the public\'s trust\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said that the future of democracy rests on the hands of the American public during his opening statement at Monday’s public meeting.\n\nHe also thanked the American public for tuning into the committee’s hearings and said that he hoped that the evidence presented lived up to their expectations.\n\n“I’m grateful to the millions of you who followed this committee’s work. I hope we lived up to our commitment to present the facts — and let the facts speak for themselves,” Thompson said.\n\nHe continued, “Let me say in closing, the women and men seated around me on this dais are public servants in the most genuine sense. They put aside politician and partisanship, to ensure the success of this committee, and providing answers to the American people.”\n\nThompson specifically thanked Republican Rep. Liz Cheney for her participation. “I especially want to thank and acknowledge our vice chair, who has become a true partner in this bipartisan effort, Ms. Cheney of Wyoming.”\n\nAmerica is still in a time of ""reflection and reckoning"" nearly 2 years after Jan. 6, chairman says\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said the panel’s findings show that former President Donald Trump was responsible for the insurrection at the US Capitol and that there is still “reckoning” left to do, nearly two years later.\n\n“We remain in strange and uncharted waters,” Thompson said, as the committee comes to the close.\n\nIn opening statements to the committee’s final public session, Thompson said Americans show faith in elected officials that they will abide by laws and uphold elected results.\n\n“If the faith is broken, so is our democracy,” he said. “Donald Trump broke that faith. He lost the 2020 election and knew it, but he chose to try to stay in office through a multi-part scheme to overturn the results and block the transfer of power.”\n\n“In the end, he summoned a mob to Washington,” he said, adding that their findings show Trump knew they were “armed and angry.”\n\nThompson said the committee intends to make the bulk of its results public in the form of its final report, expected to be released Wednesday.\n\nAlong with adopting its final report on Monday, the committee is also expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, CNN previously reported.\n\n“So, today, beyond our findings, we will also show that evidence we’ve gathered points to further action beyond the power of this committee, or the Congress, to help ensure accountability under law,” he added.\n\n“Accountability that can only be found in the criminal justice system. We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a roadmap to justice,” he said.\n\nThompson didn’t announce the criminal referrals in his opening statement but said that the panel has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nCNN’s Jeremy Herb contributed reporting to this post.\n\nNOW: The Jan. 6 committee has started its final public meeting\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has begun its final public meeting.\n\nThe panel is expected to announce criminal referrals to the Justice Department and Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, has said the panel will approve its final report at the meeting. It won’t be made public until Wednesday. Members of the committee have promised to release the report before the end of the year since Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nThe meeting — which, unlike previous gatherings of the committee, is not a hearing with witnesses — will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals, Thompson said last week.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies.\n\nThe committee has been investigating the events on and leading up to the insurrection since the panel was formed in July 2021.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee’s final public session is starting soon. Here are key things to watch for.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, will soon hold its last public meeting, marking the end of an expansive investigation that has spanned more than 17 months, encompassed more than 1,000 interviews and culminated in accusations that former President Donald Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nThrough blockbuster hearings, interviews with some of the former president’s closest allies and court battles to free up documents, the committee sought to tell the definitive narrative of what happened in the lead up to and on Jan. 6.\n\nOn Monday, members are expected to vote on its final report – spanning hundreds of pages and encapsulating its key findings, which will be released to the public on Wednesday – as well as present criminal referrals it plans to make to the Justice Department. This meeting will be the panel’s last message to the public, and members are seeking to end on a powerful note.\n\nThe charges the panel is considering asking DOJ to pursue include multiple against Trump, such as obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe recommendations match the allegations the House select committee made against Trump and his elections attorney John Eastman in a previous court proceeding seeking Eastman’s emails.\n\nThe final House report could include additional charges proposed for Trump, according to the source. It will provide justification from the committee investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nThe panel is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to Trump, CNN has reported: former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Eastman, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who leads the Jan. 6 subcommittee tasked with presenting recommendations on criminal referrals to the full panel, recently said that “the gravest offense in constitutional terms is the attempt to overthrow a presidential election and bypass the constitutional order. Subsidiary to all of that are a whole host of statutory offenses, which support the gravity and magnitude of that violent assault on America.”\n\nRaskin, along with Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, both of California, and the panel’s vice chair, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, comprised the subcommittee tasked with providing the full panel with referral recommendations that will be adopted on Monday.\n\nTrump\'s team braces for criminal referrals while he lashes out on social media, sources say\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s team huddled together multiple times since they learned the committee would be issuing criminal referrals — attempting to prepare for what they believed going to happen —a criminal referral from the House Select Committee to the Department of Justice.\n\nSources close to Trump said much of his inner circle were not ignoring the committee’s actions, despite many around the former president brushing it off as political.\n\nMany of his top advisers spent time on the phone with legal counsel, trying to get a deeper understanding of what exactly criminal referrals would mean and how to plan a response.\n\nWhile some aides said Trump was unbothered by the committee, the former president spent the weekend fixated on their actions.\n\nIn a flurry of social media posts on Truth Social, Trump called the committee names, accused them of “illegally leaking confidential info” and hitting individuals sitting on the committee.\n\nHe also posted copies of tweets from the afternoon on Jan. 6, calling for protestors to be “peaceful.” During the Jan. 6 hearings, former White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews testified that she was told Trump did not want to include any mention of “peace” in his tweets, but ultimately gave in to White House officials and advisers urged the former president to do more as the violent attack was unfolding.\n\nThe criminal referrals are just the latest in a long line of legal battles Trump is facing as he ramps up his third presidential campaign.\n\nToday\'s committee meeting is expected to have a ""simple and sober"" tone\n\nAs the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection lays out its evidence and criminal referrals today, lawmakers are expected to hit a sober tone, sources say.\n\nToday’s meeting is expected to be relatively brief with some multimedia presentations.\n\nUnlike previous hearings that relied on compelling witness testimony and splashy video montages, today’s event is designed to drive home the key evidence the committee uncovered and the gravity of what transpired in the run up and on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Nobody’s spiking the football here,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat and Jan. 6 committee member, told CNN just ahead of the committee meeting.\n\nJan. 6 committee treating release of executive summary and today\'s meeting as a roadmap for DOJ, sources say\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is treating today’s public meeting and the release of its executive summary as a “roadmap” for the Department of Justice, sources tell CNN.\n\nThe committee intends to lay out its body of evidence and drive home its conclusion that former President Donald Trump was culpable for the events that transpired on Jan. 6, 2021 — the basis for its plans to refer Trump to DOJ on at least three criminal charges.\n\nLawmakers are primarily focused on laying out their case for DOJ, but their wide-ranging investigation has uncovered information that congressional investigators believe could be relevant to various bodies — from state bars to the House ethics committee.\n\nCongressional investigators have already provided what they believe is evidence of criminal activity to an Atlanta-area district attorney leading a criminal investigation into Trump and his allies, according to someone familiar with the investigation.\n\nTrump legal team mired in disagreements as he faces criminal referral\n\nAs the Jan. 6 committee is expected to issue a criminal referral for former President Donald Trump, his legal team has continued to be bogged down in internal disagreements about the many probes facing him.\n\nTrump’s team has met to talk about what to expect from the committee today, but they are much more focused and concerned with the other investigations facing him, including the federal grand jury on Jan. 6, the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation and the special grand jury in Georgia, multiple people familiar with the workings of the team say.\n\nDespite the many probes facing Trump, his team is not acting as a unified front, but has often been locked in serious disagreement over how to proceed on several of the investigations, mainly when it comes to the documents one.\n\nOne thing Trump’s advisers will watch for today is how deep the referrals from the committee go and whether it mentions obstruction of the investigation when it pertains to Trump.\n\nTrump advisers and aides will be watching the meeting today closely, however sources close to Trump said the former President has told them he does not plan on watching.\n\nHowever, he will be updated by people around him, as he has been for all of the public hearings thus far.\n\nAs of now, Trump’s legal team will not be engaging in the response to the committee today, however sources stress that this could change as the public meeting unfolds.\n\nThese are the crimes the Jan. 6 committee is said to be considering for a Trump referral\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is eyeing multiple alleged crimes for a referral of former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, CNN reported last week.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the matter, they include:\n\nInsurrection\n\nObstruction of an official proceeding\n\nConspiracy to defraud the federal government\n\nFor the latter two, the lawmakers can rely on an opinion from a federal judge in California, who wrote earlier this year that there was evidence that Trump and his allies were plotting to defraud the US government and to obstruct an official proceeding. The opinion was handed down by US District Judge David O. Carter in a dispute over whether the House could access certain emails sent to and from former Trump attorney John Eastman.\n\nThe judge cited emails discussing Trump’s awareness that certain voter fraud claims being made in court were inaccurate as evidence of a plot to defraud the federal government. To explain his finding of evidence of obstruction, the judge pointed to emails that showed that the Trump team was contemplating filing lawsuits not to obtain legitimate legal relief, but to meddle in congressional proceedings.\n\nA House referral for an insurrection charge would be a more aggressive move. It’s a crime to assist or engage in “in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws.” Judges have used the term “insurrection” to describe the January 6 attack on Congress’ certification of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut the Justice Department has not opted to bring the charge in its hundreds of US Capitol riot cases. Instead, prosecutors have relied on criminal statutes related to violence, obstruction of an official proceeding, and, in some limited cases, seditious conspiracy.\n\nWho else could be referred? The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies including, Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, multiple sources told CNN earlier this month.\n\nAnother source cautioned at the time that while names were being considered, there was still discussion to be had before they were finalized.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nRep. Schiff: Jan. 6 committee considering how to handle uncooperative GOP lawmakers\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, said Sunday the panel is considering how to hold accountable the GOP lawmakers who defied their subpoenas.\n\nSchiff said the committee would be considering this on Monday, noting that the panel has weighed whether it is better to criminally refer members of Congress to other parts of the federal government or if Congress should “police its own.” Such congressional mechanisms could include censure and referrals to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nFive House Republicans have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 panel: GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe select committee is set to hold its final public hearing today and release its full report on Wednesday. The panel is expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe impact House referrals could have remains unclear because the Department of Justice special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut in addition to criminal referrals, Jan. 6 committee Chairman Bennie Thompson told reporters that the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\n“Censure was something that we have considered. Ethics referrals is something we have considered,” Schiff said Sunday, noting that the committee will disclose its decision Monday.\n\nCNN previously reported that the panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies, including former Trump attorney John Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark and former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to multiple sources.\n\nWhy today\'s Jan. 6 committee session is a meeting and not a hearing\n\nNearly two years removed from the violent attack on the US Capitol, the House select committee tasked with finding out exactly what happened is about to show its hand.\n\nThe panel will hold its final public meeting on Monday, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday.\n\nUnlike previous gatherings of the committee, Monday’s is a business meeting rather than a hearing as no witnesses are set to testify.\n\nWhat to expect from the session: The public meeting, scheduled for 1:00 p.m. ET, is expected to see the panel announce that it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department.\n\nThe committee will release an executive summary of the investigation’s report on Monday after the meeting, a committee aide said Sunday. The final report, to be released two days later, will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nWhy now? Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nA recap of what unfolded in the Jan. 6 committee\'s hearing in October\n\nThe House select committee’s October hearing on the Capitol Hill insurrection used testimony and evidence to demonstrate how former President Donald Trump knew he had lost the election but still went forward with efforts to overturn the results, leading to the attack on the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHere’s a recap of what unfolded at the hearing:\n\nThe committee voted to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony.\n\nPreviously unseen footage aired from the DC-area Army base where congressional leaders took refuge during the insurrection.\n\nElaine Chao, who resigned from her post as Trump’s secretary of Transportation a day after the insurrection, spoke in personal terms about her disgust toward the attack when she testified. “I think the events at the Capitol, however they occurred, were shocking,” she said.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, provided new testimony to the committee relaying anecdotes of Trump acknowledging he had lost the election.\n\nThe panel revealed some of what they had learned from the 1 million Secret Service records obtained within roughly three months since the last January 6 committee hearing.\n\nThe committee revealed new evidence that Trump had devised a plan, well before any votes were counted, to declare victory no matter what the election results were.\n\nCommittee members interviewed Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, last month but ultimately her testimony was not featured as part of the panel’s hearing in October.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHere\'s what the Jan. 6 committee chair said about the referrals the panel will announce Monday\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters last week that the panel will make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department in Monday’s meeting.\n\nWhat this means: Criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack ongoing.\n\nCommittee members see criminal referrals as a critical part of their work, putting their views on the record in order to complete their investigation – not as a way to pressure DOJ, sources have told CNN.\n\nThompson told CNN that the panel is looking at five to six categories of referrals beyond those deemed criminal, but has not decided on the specific number of individuals.\n\nThompson said that in addition to criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, there could be other categories of referrals the committee makes such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nThompson told reporters last Tuesday that Monday’s public meeting will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals.\n\nA subcommittee of members has made recommendations to the full committee about various referrals. During the public meeting, the full committee is expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nCNN reported earlier this month that the committee is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to former President Donald Trump,\n\nA reminder of the key events that unfolded during the Jan. 6 insurrection\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is set to lay out its findings in a final report. When and how the events occurred that day have been a key part of the committee’s probe since the panel formed in July 2021.\n\nSupporters of then-President Trump breached the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, engulfing the building in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to protest against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to certify President Biden’s win.\n\nHere’s how key events unfolded throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump’s speech:\n\nAt 1:10 p.m. ET, while Congress began the process of affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, Trump encouraged his supporters to protest at the US Capitol. Despite promising he would join them, Trump retreated to the White House in his SUV and watched on television as the violence unfolded on Capitol Hill.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. ET, hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers “traitors” for doing their jobs.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Then-Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.\n\nAn armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.\n\nThe Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they had successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they were removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.\n\nThe US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building.\n\nWith about 30 minutes to go before Washington, DC’s 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds. It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.\n\nLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business — namely, confirming Biden’s win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.\n\nProceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence — who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary — bringing the Senate session back into order.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier on the evening of Jan. 6 that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session that night.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the “United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.”\n\nIt took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning (Jan. 7, 2021), but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden’s election win.\n\nSee the full timeline of events here.\n\nWhy the committee is wrapping up its investigation\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters the committee will hold its final public meeting on Monday and that the panel’s full report will come out December 21.\n\nThompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said the committee will approve the panel’s final report on Dec. 19 and make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department, but the public will not see the final report until two days later.\n\n“We will do all of the business of the committee on the 19th,” Thompson said, which includes voting on the final report.\n\nMembers of the committee have promised to have the committee’s report released before the end of the year, as Republicans are expected to dissolve the committee when they take over the chamber in the next Congress.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe other notable investigations Trump faces\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, whose third White House bid has already become mired in controversy, is facing a myriad of legal issues, alongside his business and allies.\n\nAside from the Jan. 6 committee’s probe, here are some other notable investigations involving Trump:\n\nTax returns.The House Ways and Means Committee finally got access to the former president’s tax returns after the Supreme Court dealt a massive defeat to Trump, paving the way for the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the documents to the Democratic-led House. The committee’s chairman, Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sought the tax returns from the IRS in 2019, and the agency, under the Trump administration, initially resisted turning them over.\n\nMar-a-Lago documents. Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed special counsel Jack Smith to oversee the Justice Department criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were brought to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury in Washington has been empaneled and has interviewed potential witnesses to how Trump handled the documents.\n\n2020 Election. The Justice Department has an investigation of its own into the post-2020 election period. While DOJ has not acted publicly during the so-called quiet period leading up to the midterms, a grand jury in Washington has been hearing from witnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is overseeing a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. The probe was launched following Trump’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.\n\nTrump Organization. New York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation, sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\nJames alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.\n\nRead more about other investigations here.\n\nThese are the 9 members on the Jan. 6 committee\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report.\n\nThe committee is made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nChair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California\n\nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California\n\nRepublicans\n\nVice chair: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nHere\'s what a criminal referral is — and what it means for the Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection is set to make announcements at its final public meeting on Monday about criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\nSo what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case.\n\nWith the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nBut whether the department brings charges will depend on whether the facts and the evidence support a prosecution, Attorney General Merrick Garland has said. Garland will make the ultimate call on charging decisions.\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chair of the Jan. 6 committee, has said the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nEx-police officer who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 says he wants to see DOJ indict Trump\n\nMichael Fanone, a former DC police officer and CNN law enforcement analyst, told CNN he would like to see the referrals from the Jan. 6 committee lead to an indictment of former President Donald Trump.\n\nFanone was beaten by rioters during the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.\n\n“I would like to see those individuals put on trial and then again, as I’ve said many times, as Americans we should accept the results of those trials, even if it includes a guilty verdict for former President Donald Trump and jail time,” he said.\n\nFanone also said he is “hopeful” the Justice Department will bring an indictment against Trump.\n\nThe White House is expected to watch quietly as Jan. 6 committee delivers final report this week\n\nWhen the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol delivers its ultimate conclusion to the public this week – holding a final public meeting on Monday and announcing expected criminal referrals to the Justice Department, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday – the White House is expected to watch quietly and decline to offer judgment on any recommendations that the panel may make to the Justice Department.\n\nFor much of the year, top White House officials have made painstaking efforts to avoid delivering specific commentary on the panel’s work. There was one goal in particular of utmost urgency: staying clear of any moves that might suggest that the White House was trying to exert influence on the DOJ.\n\nAnd those efforts are likely to become even more imperative for the Biden White House after the committee refers at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, as a source familiar with the matter said the committee was expected to do this week.\n\nOne White House official told CNN ahead of the committee’s upcoming last meeting on Monday that it would continue to not weigh in on any potential referrals or actions that the panel may take. Another official said this would be in line with the White House’s efforts this year to avoid “running pundit” on the panel’s work.\n\nBut officials also noted that President Biden himself has been clear in his public remarks about the significance of what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, the importance of the committee’s work, not to mention his rejection of last year’s insurrection and the threats to the country’s democratic systems.\n\nIndeed, Biden made that a central theme of his political message in the lead-up to the midterm elections – that decision drew criticism from some fellow Democrats who argued he needed to have a nearly singular focus on the economy, but ultimately left the White House feeling vindicated after Democrats far outperformed expectations.\n\nAnd in the rare moments that Biden did directly comment on the committee, he made clear that he believes the members are doing work critical to documenting history.\n\n“It’s important the American people understand what truly happened and to understand that the same forces that led January 6 remain at work today,” Biden said this summer.\n\nIn October, following a hearing that revealed evidence and testimony from former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchison who said Trump continued efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election even though he knew he had lost reelection, Biden described the testimony and video as “absolutely devastating.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/live-updates/jan-6-hearings-committee-criminal-referrals-trump-final-report', 'Headline': 'LIVE: Jan. 6 panel announces 4 criminal referrals for Donald Trump', 'Snippet': 'The House Select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has issued its final report. It includes several four referrals for Donald Trump. Follow our live updates.', 'Full_text': 'Progressives have been irritated with Attorney General Merrick Garland’s methodical (read: slow) pace of pursuing charges against Trump. But it’s going to be up to the special counsel whether it brings charges or what they are.\n\nThey do not have to act on what the Jan. 6 committee recommends, though investigators are paying close attention to the details of its findings.\n\nBut don’t expect to hear much about the special counsel’s progress, as the DOJ tends to stay pretty quiet, if not wholly silent, on the details of ongoing investigations until they present them in court.\n\nPolitically, it’s going to be up to voters to choose. Trump will likely retain support with his base. As we noted, Republicans have been the least likely to be paying close attention to these hearings. In a multi-candidate primary, Trump remains the front-runner for the GOP nomination.\n\nBut he’s in legal trouble in multiple states, not just federally, and many of his preferred candidates – and election deniers – lost in swing states. So whether it’s because of the chaos that often surrounds him, the threat he presents to U.S. democracy and faith in its elections, or simply because his brand is not a winner in competitive states where Republicans likely need to win to take over the White House and Congress, Trump is at his most vulnerable point since winning the presidency six years ago.\n\nAnd the members of this committee – some of whom won’t be returning to Congress because of the wrath, or potential wrath, of Trump’s base – certainly hope voters respond.\n\n“The future of our democracy rests in your hands,” chairman Bennie Thompson D-Miss. said today. “It’s up to the people to decide who is deserving of the public trust.”\n\n➡️A full set of takeaways from NPR\'s Senior Political Editor, Domenico Montanaro, will be available on NPR.org tomorrow morning.\n\nIt’s no secret that the country is divided politically and partisanship, particularly among Republicans, has become entrenched. So despite the primary evidence – with testimony from Republicans who were aligned with Trump – people have been watching selectively.\n\nThe committee in its report recognized this:\n\n“Although the Committee’s hearings were viewed live by tens of millions of Americans and widely publicized in nearly every major news source, the Committee also recognizes that other news outlets and commentators have actively discouraged viewers from watching, and that millions of other Americans have not yet seen the actual evidence addressed by this Report.”\n\nSo the committee said it’s releasing video summaries with each relevant piece of evidence. And it’s likely why the beginning of the hearing included so many clips of previously seen testimony from past hearings, almost like the recap of a prior season of a series on Netflix.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest those who watched were moved. Before the hearings, just 48% of independents in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll said they thought Trump was to blame a “great deal” or “good amount” for what happened that day. After several hearings, the July survey found that the percentage blaming Trump spiked to 57%.\n\nRepublicans were only up marginally – and still fewer than 1-in-5 said Trump was responsible for what happened.\n\nEighty percent of Democrats and 55% of independents said they were paying “a lot” or “some” attention to the hearings. But 56% of Republicans said they were not.\n\nIt’s not hard to draw a straight line between the numbers of those paying attention and the movement – or lack thereof – in the survey.\n\n➡️A full set of takeaways from NPR\'s Senior Political Editor, Domenico Montanaro, will be available on NPR.org tomorrow morning.\n\nIt\'s now been more than an hour after the Jan. 6 committee hearing wrapped, and former President Donald Trump has made only one comment related to today\'s hearing: A knock on Vice Chair Liz Cheney\'s primary loss in August.\n\n""...But Liz Chaney lost by a record 40 points!"" he wrote, misspelling Cheney\'s name in a post on Truth Social, the social media network he founded in the wake of his bans from mainstream platforms like Twitter and Facebook after the riot at the Capitol.\n\nCheney, a Republican who is Wyoming\'s sole representative in the House, lost in the August primary to her Trump-endorsed challenger by 37.4 percentage points. As a result, she will not return to Congress next year.\n\nOn a day when the House committee referred him for criminal prosecution on four different charges, Trump instead focused most of his public statements on two other subjects: the possibility of a Trump-era immigration policy known as Title 42 coming to an end, and conservative media reports about content moderation decisions at Twitter during the 2020 election campaign.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump complained that the committee was ""highly partisan"" and accused its members of ""illegally leaking"" confidential information.\n\n""How much longer are Republicans, and American Patriots in general, going to allow this to happen,"" he wrote.\n\nAnd he applauded the reinstatement of his Twitter account and his two public posts on Jan. 6 asking rioters to ""remain peaceful."" Those tweets were sent long after he urged his supporters to march on the Capitol; by the time he made his first post, rioters had already been inside the Capitol for nearly 30 minutes, and at least one rioter was already dead, according to the timeline established by the Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation was hampered by lack of cooperation by witnesses, ultimately impacting the number of referrals the committee could send to the Justice Department, committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said Monday.\n\n""There were undoubtedly other people involved. But we were stymied by virtue of a lot of people refusing to come and testify, refusing to give us information they had, or taking the 5th Amendment,"" Raskin said, speaking to reporters immediately after the committee\'s meeting ended. ""We chose to advance the names of people where we felt certain that there was abundant evidence that they had participated in crimes, and so we\'re sending those over. It\'s not to the exclusion of anyone else.""\n\nThe evidence gathered by the committee will be shared in full with the Department of Justice this week, said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Much will be released to the public on Wednesday, including interview transcripts.\n\nThe DOJ has carried on its own investigation of the events leading up to Jan. 6, 2021. Some witnesses who refused to cooperate with the House committee may be compelled to cooperate with the Department of Justice, which has greater capabilities to enforce subpoenas.\n\n""The long and the short of it is we possess evidence that, up until this release, the Justice Department may not have. They possess evidence that we don\'t have. And the cumulative impact of all of that evidence will hopefully lead to justice for those who have broken the law here,"" said Rep. Schiff.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee has officially outlined criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump and other individuals on four charges.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., discussed the charges at the end of the committee\'s meeting on Monday, as well as the standard that it used to decide them.\n\n""We propose advancing referrals where the gravity of the specific offense, severity of its actual harm and centrality of the offender to the overall design of the unlawful scheme to overthrow the election compel us to speak,"" he said.\n\nThese are the charges the committee is making:\n\nObstruction of an official proceeding of the U.S. government: Raskin said the evidence described by his colleagues in hearings warrants a criminal referral of Trump, John Eastman and others for violation of Title 18, Section 1512C, adding that ""the whole purpose and obvious effect of Trump\'s scheme were to obstruct, influence and impede this official proceeding.""\n\nConspiracy to defraud the U.S.: Raskin said there is ""more than sufficient evidence"" to refer Trump, Eastman and others for violating Title 18, Section 371, which covers making an agreement to impair, obstruct or defeat the lawful functions of the U.S. government by deceitful or dishonest means.\n\nHe added that Trump didn\'t engage in these actions alone, and that the committee\'s full report details the efforts of co-conspirators who agreed with and participated in Trump\'s plan to defeat certification of Biden\'s victory. But he also stressed that the panel doesn\'t attempt to determine all potential participations, since many individuals have refused to answer its questions. It trusts the Justice Department will be able to form a more complete picture through its investigation, Raskin added.\n\nConspiracy to make a false statement: The committee alleges that Trump and others knowingly and willfully made materially false statements to the federal government in violation of U.S.C. §§ 371, 1001. Raskin said the evidence ""clearly suggests"" Trump conspired with others to submit slates of false electors to Congress and the National Archives. Like with the previous charge, Raskin said many individuals refused to answer questions under oath and that the Justice Department may be able to shed more light on this alleged conspiracy.\n\n""Incite,” “assist” or “aid and comfort” an insurrection: An insurrection is a rebellion against the authority of the U.S., Raskin said, a ""grave federal offense"" that is written into the constitution as grounds for automatically disqualifying participants from holding office at the state or federal level. Raskin said ""more than sufficient evidence exists"" for a criminal referral of Trump for assisting, aiding and comforting those at the Capitol.\n\nStressing the lack of cooperation by potentially key individuals, Raskin also said the committee is referring four members of Congress for sanction by the House ethics committee for failure to comply with lawful subpoenas. And he said all of these referrals are not a decision the committee took likely.\n\n""We understand the gravity of each and every referral we are making today, just as we understand the magnitude of the crime against democracy that we describe in our report,"" he said. ""But we have gone where the facts and the law lead us and, inescapably, they lead us here.""\n\nRaskin said that the events of Jan. 6 consist of ""hundreds of individual criminal offenses,"" most of which are already being prosecuted by the Justice Department. But he emphasized that ""ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass.""\n\nThe committee has issued approximately 100 subpoenas to individuals, organizations and corporate entities since it began its investigation.\n\nThe extensive list includes Republican lawmakers, Trump allies, even the ex-president himself. And though many of those who were subpoenaed cooperated with the committee, others did not.\n\nThe full list of subpoenas issued can be found here, but here are some of the notable names:\n\nSteve Bannon\n\nBreitbart News founder Steve Bannon, who also served as Trump’s chief political strategist, said “all hell is going to break loose” on his far-right podcast on the day before the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nHe was subpoenaed by the committee in September 2021, and after Bannon openly mocked the panel and its demands, he was indicted for refusing to provide documents and failing to appear before the committee.\n\nA judge sentenced Bannon to four months in jail and fined him $6,500 this past October, a lesser sentence than the six months and $200,000 federal prosecutors sought.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service\n\nThe committee subpoenaed one of the nation’s elite law enforcement agencies for deleted text messages from the days leading up to and after the Jan. 6 attack along with other electronic documents.\n\nThe Secret Service complied with the request and handed over more than 1 million emails, recordings and other electronic records to the committee.\n\nThe materials obtained through that subpoena showed that the Secret Service knew there was a threat of violence leading up to Jan. 6, and that agents feared for the vice president’s life.\n\nTrump and members of his family\n\nDonald Trump was subpoenaed at the end of the committee’s final hearing in October. And though many of his family members cooperated with the panel voluntarily, others did not, including Kimberly Guilfoyle, one of the former president’s advisors and fiancé of Donald Trump Jr.\n\nThe committee also subpoenaed the phone records of the ex-president’s other son, Eric Trump, who — along with Guilfoyle — spoke from the Ellipse on Jan. 6 before the former president told the mob to march on the Capitol.\n\nJohn Eastman\n\nThe former law professor joined Trump’s legal team in August 2020 but is best known for his plan for Trump to use then-Vice President Pence to overturn the election results, despite his understanding that doing so would be illegal. Eastman sought a presidential pardon from Trump but didn’t get one.\n\nEastman complied with the subpoena but invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at least 100 times.\n\n➡️Check out NPR\'s full subpoena tracker here.\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals to the Justice Department, there could be other categories of referrals as well — to the Federal Election Commission, the House Ethics Committee, and bar associations to discipline attorneys. The Justice Department is separately investigating the Jan. 6 attack with a special counsel.\n\nNPR obtained a small portion of a draft script for the Monday meeting that shows the panel intends to accuse lawyers John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro of being tied to the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nEastman was a Trump ally who helped lead the effort to overturn President Biden\'s win, while Chesebro has been considered a central figure in the scheme pushing for a slate of fake Trump electors in various states won by Biden.\n\nChesebro\'s attorney, Adam Kaufmann, in an emailed statement to NPR, pushed back of that assertion and said his client gave the Trump campaign pro bono guidance on ""arcane provisions"" of the Electoral Count Act and the 12th Amendment, which outlines procedural steps for electing the president and vice president.\n\nThe panel could also refer five House Republicans who were subpoenaed but refused to cooperate to the House Ethics committee: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut with the congressional session wrapping up in a matter of weeks and Republicans about to take control of the House, it\'s unlikely the ethics panel will launch any new probe.\n\nWhen asked at a press conference last week if he was concerned that he and his colleagues might face criminal referrals, McCarthy said, ""No, not at all. We did nothing wrong.""\n\n🎧Listen to NPR\'s Claudia Grisales discuss her reporting on Morning Edition.\n\nWhat\'s happening today?\n\nThe nine-member committee, which includes seven Democrats and two Republicans, is expected to discuss its final report during Monday\'s meeting. The lawmakers will vote on criminal referrals of key players who plotted to keep Trump in office. The panel is expected to consider criminal referrals for fewer than a dozen individuals. Each member will offer presentations highlighting the specific areas the panel worked on over the course of the investigation.\n\nWhen?\n\n1 p.m. ET\n\nWhy does today\'s meeting matter?\n\nThis is the culmination of a lengthy investigation into the attack on Jan. 6, 2021. The committee is also expected to provide its assessment of weaknesses in the electoral system, which members argued enabled Trump and his allies to go as far as they did in their attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The panel will make policy recommendations aimed at better protecting democratic institutions and processes, including reforming the Electoral Count Act.\n\nWhat\'s next after today?\n\nThe select committee will dissolve at the end of the current Congress, just after the start of the new year. Four members of the panel will not return to the House in 2023: Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the only two Republican members of the committee, along with Democratic Reps. Elaine Luria of Virginia and Stephanie Murphy of Florida.\n\nA lot has happened since the committee held its first hearing in July 2021. NPR has rounded up some of the critical takeaways from the investigation to help bring you up to speed.\n\nLaw enforcement described the attack as “brutal” in the committee’s first hearing\n\nFour police officers testified before the committee at its first hearing on July 27, 2021. One officer described his engagement with the thousands of protesters at the Capitol as ""nothing short of brutal"" and condemned politicians who tried to downplay the attack.\n\nThe officers called on the committee to find out who was responsible for the attack, noting that all signs pointed to former President Trump. One officer even used a hit man analogy to drive the point home to lawmakers.\n\n""If a hit man is hired and he kills somebody, the hit man goes to jail. But not only does the hit man go to jail, but the person who hired him does,"" said Pfc. Harry Dunn of the U.S. Capitol Police, adding, ""I want you to get to the bottom of that.""\n\nTrump tried to pressure Mike Pence into overturning results\n\nTestimony from two advisors to the former vice president painted a picture of Trump trying to strong arm Pence into illegally overturning the 2020 election results, knowing full well that he lost to Joe Biden.\n\nTrump called Pence a “wimp”, among other insults, fueling the crowds who began to call for Pence’s head, and continued to ridicule Pence long after the attack. The public hearing also laid out potential criminal liability for Trump and lawyer John Eastman for conspiring to obstruct Congress.\n\nA tidal wave of Trump allies sought pardons after Jan. 6\n\n""Just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,"" former President Trump said, according to the testimony of former acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue.\n\nWhite House staff and lawyers testified before the committee on June 23, 2022, that at least five members of Congress all sought pardons following the attack on the Capitol: Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Mo Brooks, R-Ala.; Louie Gohmert, R-Texas; Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; and Scott Perry, R-Penn. So did former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and lawyer John Eastman.\n\nThough they all denied any wrongdoing, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said, ""The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is if you committed a crime.""\n\nA former White House aide said Trump knew protesters were armed and didn’t care\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, previously an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, said in a pre-recorded testimony (played during the Jun. 28 hearing) that Trump knew some protesters were armed when he ordered them to march to the Capitol.\n\nShe went on to say that the former president became “irate” when he was told he had to return to the White House instead of joining his supporters at the Capitol. ""\'I am the effing president, take me up to the Capitol now,\'"" Hutchinson recalled the then-president saying.\n\nTrump sued the committee after it subpoenaed him in October\n\nAt the end of the committee’s hearing on Oct. 22, members unanimously voted to subpoena the former president.\n\n""In short, you were at the center of the first and only effort by any U.S. President to overturn an election and obstruct the peaceful transition of power, ultimately culminating in a bloody attack on our own Capitol and on the Congress itself,"" Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the panel\'s chair, and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., its vice chair, said in a letter to Trump.\n\nThe ex-president was supposed to turn over documents and appear before the committee in November, however, Trump decided not to cooperate and instead filed a lawsuit to avoid confronting the panel.\n\n➡️If you\'re looking for more highlights, check out the big, 14-item list from NPR\'s Senior Political Editor, Domenico Montanaro.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/23/1145209559/jan-6-committee-final-report', 'Headline': 'The full January 6 report is out. Here are the key details and ...', 'Snippet': 'Pro-Trump supporters attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A House select committee has spent roughly a year and a half investigating what led to the riot and released its full report on Friday.', 'Full_text': 'After roughly 18 months of investigations, the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has released their full report.\n\nThe document, which is more than 800 pages long, recommends the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in the attack. And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/19/us/jan-6-committee-trump', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Committee Report and Hearing: Jan. 6 Committee Refers Former ...', 'Snippet': 'The criminal referrals were a major escalation for a congressional investigation that is the most significant in a generation.

The panel named five other Trump allies — Mark Meadows, his final chief of staff, and the lawyers Rudolph W. Giuliani, John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro — as potential co-conspirators with Mr. Trump in actions the committee said warranted Justice Department investigation. The charges, including a fourth for Mr. Trump of conspiracy to make a false statement, would carry prison sentences, some of them lengthy, if federal prosecutors chose to pursue them.\n\nThe committee’s referrals do not carry legal weight or compel any action by the Justice Department, which is conducting its own investigation into Jan. 6 and the actions of Mr. Trump and his allies leading up to the attack. But the referrals sent a powerful signal that a bipartisan committee of Congress believes the former president committed crimes.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the referrals.\n\nMr. Trump attacked the committee as “highly partisan” ahead of a final meeting the panel held on Monday to release an executive summary of its final report on the Capitol attack and to vote on referring the former president to the Justice Department.\n\n“It’s a kangaroo court,” Mr. Trump said Monday on “The Dan Bongino Show.” “The people aren’t going to stand for it.” He elaborated on that theme in a post on Truth Social, his social media network, after the meeting.\n\n“These folks don’t get it that when they come after me, people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me,” he said, adding that he “told everyone to go home” on Jan. 6, but leaving out his hours of inaction before that while a mob of his supporters rampaged through the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans, who have vowed to investigate the committee after they take control of the House in January, mounted a modest response. Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 House Republican, was one of the few to react with a statement, accusing the committee of staging a “partisan charade.” She promised that Republicans “will hold House Democrats accountable for their illegitimate abuse of power.”\n\nThe executive summary, a 154-page narrative of Mr. Trump’s relentless drive to remain in power after he lost the 2020 election by seven million votes, identifies co-conspirators who aided Mr. Trump. But it singles out the former president as the primary cause of the mob violence.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straightforward conclusion: The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the summary stated. “None of the events of Jan. 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nThe summary closely follows the evidence from the committee’s 10 previous public hearings, but the facts have been assembled into a readable narrative that amounts to an astonishing story of Mr. Trump’s efforts to effectively overthrow the government he led. The committee is expected to release a lengthy final report on Wednesday.\n\n“Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one,” Representative Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican and vice chairwoman of the committee, said at the start of the meeting.\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee, said of Mr. Trump: “Nothing could be a greater betrayal of this duty than to assist in insurrection against the constitutional order.”\n\nThe summary and referrals have now set up a dynamic without parallel in the annals of American campaigns: Congress asking the Justice Department of an incumbent president to consider criminal charges against the president’s potential opponent in the next election. President Biden has indicated his intent to run in 2024, and Mr. Trump announced his re-election campaign last month.\n\nThe summary laid out step by step how Mr. Trump sought to cling to power, much as the committee did during its televised hearings in the summer. First, the summary said, Mr. Trump lied about widespread fraud, despite being told his claims were false. He then organized false slates of electors in states won by Mr. Biden as he pressured state officials, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election. Finally, he amassed a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol, where they engaged in hours of bloody violence while Mr. Trump did nothing to call them off.\n\n“Even key individuals who worked closely with President Trump to try to overturn the 2020 election on Jan. 6 ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful,” the committee wrote.\n\nThe panel also referred four Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee — including the man seeking to become the next speaker, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California — because of their refusal to comply with the panel’s subpoenas.\n\nMr. McCarthy’s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe other Republicans referred were Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Jordan, Russell Dye, said in a statement that the referral was “just another partisan and political stunt.” A spokesman for Mr. Perry, Jay Ostrich, said the committee was engaged in “more games from a petulant and soon-to-be kangaroo court.’’\n\nMr. Biggs said in a tweet that the referral was the committee’s “final political stunt” and that he looked forward to “reviewing their documents, publishing their lies and setting the record straight” in the next Congress.\n\nIn its summary, the committee did not entirely resolve disputed accounts of what happened inside the presidential S.U.V. when Mr. Trump was told by his Secret Service agents that they could not take him to the Capitol to join the crowd on Jan. 6. Cassidy Hutchinson, a former White House aide, testified under oath to the committee in public last summer that Anthony M. Ornato, a White House deputy chief of staff, told her that Mr. Trump grew so angry that he lunged at his Secret Service agent and tried to grab the steering wheel. The Secret Service denied that account anonymously.\n\nThe summary said only that the “committee has now obtained evidence from several sources about a ‘furious interaction’” that occurred in the S.U.V. “The vast majority of witnesses who have testified to the select committee about this topic, including multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Metropolitan Police and national security officials in the White House, described President Trump’s behavior as ‘irate,’ ‘furious,’ ‘insistent,’ ‘profane’ and ‘heated.’”\n\nThe committee’s summary also concluded that there was no nefarious reason for why the National Guard was delayed for hours in responding to violence of Jan. 6.\n\n“Although evidence identifies a likely miscommunication between members of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense impacting the timing of deployment, the committee has found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard,” the committee wrote. “The select committee recognizes that some at the department had genuine concerns, counseling caution, that President Trump might give an illegal order to use the military in support of his efforts to overturn the election.”\n\nIn its summary, the panel asked the Justice Department to investigate whether anyone had interfered with or obstructed the panel’s investigation, including whether any lawyers paid for by groups connected to Mr. Trump “may have advised clients to provide false or misleading testimony to the committee.”\n\nAmong the committee’s findings, revealed at its meeting on Monday, was that lawmakers became concerned that lawyers who were paid by Trump associates may have tried to interfere with the panel’s investigation. The panel also learned that a client was offered potential employment that would make her “financially very comfortable” as the date of her testimony approached. But then offers were withdrawn or did not materialize as reports of the content of her testimony circulated, the committee said.\n\nThe committee also chastised certain witnesses that it said had not been forthright with investigators. It said it had “significant concerns about the credibility” of the testimony of Mr. Ornato.\n\nThe committee also said Kayleigh McEnany, one of Mr. Trump’s former press secretaries, and Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, had been less than forthcoming.\n\nThe summary demonstrated, as the committee’s hearings did, how despite being told repeatedly that his claims of election fraud were false, Mr. Trump kept up the lies.\n\nBill Stepien, a former White House political director, told the committee how he and others would investigate the claims, find them to be false, and report back to the president. “It’s an easier job to be telling the president about, you know, wild allegations,” Mr. Stepien said. “It’s a harder job to be telling him on the back end that, yeah, that wasn’t true.”\n\nThe summary also contained evidence that certain White House aides had grown concerned about the potential for violence on Jan. 6 and urged Mr. Trump to make a pre-emptive statement calling for peace. No such statement was made.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House communications director, said she suggested “several times” on Jan. 4 and 5 that Mr. Trump “publicly state that Jan. 6 must remain peaceful, and that he had refused her advice to do so,” the panel wrote.\n\nThe panel played new video from Ms. Hicks, who described a conversation with Mr. Trump.\n\n“I was becoming increasingly concerned that we were damaging his legacy,” Ms. Hicks said she told the president.\n\nMr. Trump’s response? “Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,” she recalled him saying.\n\nWhile the executive summary of the report focused heavily on Mr. Trump, it did conclude some findings about law enforcement failures, a topic not previously addressed at the panel’s hearings. “No analysis recognized the full scale and extent of the threat to the Capitol on Jan. 6,” the committee wrote, although the “intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did successfully detect the planning for potential violence on Jan. 6, including planning specifically by the Proud Boys and Oath Keeper militia groups who ultimately led the attack on the Capitol.”\n\nOver the past year and a half, the committee interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, obtained more than one million documents, issued more than 100 subpoenas and held hearings that drew millions of viewers.\n\nThe House created the Jan. 6 committee after Senate Republicans used a filibuster to defeat a proposal to create an independent commission to investigate the attack.\n\nThe committee — made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans — consistently broke new ground for a congressional investigation. Staffed with more than a dozen former federal prosecutors, the panel set a new production standard for how to hold a congressional hearing. It also got significantly ahead of a parallel Justice Department investigation into the events of Jan. 6, with federal prosecutors later interviewing many of the same witnesses Congress had spoken to.\n\nIn recent weeks, federal prosecutors under the supervision of a special counsel have issued subpoenas to officials in seven states in which the Trump campaign organized electors to falsely certify the election for Mr. Trump despite the voters choosing Mr. Biden.\n\nLawmakers on the panel also believe they played a significant role in elevating the issue of threats to democracy to voters, who rejected many election deniers in the November midterms.\n\nIn terms of legislative recommendations, the panel has already endorsed overhauling the Electoral Count Act, the law that Mr. Trump and his allies tried to exploit on Jan. 6 in an attempt to cling to power. Lawmakers have also discussed changes to the Insurrection Act and legislation to enforce the 14th Amendment’s prohibition on insurrectionists holding office. Those recommendations are expected to be detailed in the committee’s final report.\n\nKatie Benner and Anushka Patil contributed reporting.\n\nAnnotation: This reflects the committee’s finding that Mr. Trump’s repeated false claims that the election was rigged had both a political and financial motive. During its second hearing, the panel introduced evidence that Trump supporters donated nearly $100 million to Mr. Trump’s so-called Election Defense Fund but that the money flowed instead into a super PAC the president had created. It was not just “the big lie,” the committee said. It was also “the big rip-off.”\n\n2. Knowing that he and his supporters had lost dozens of election lawsuits, and despite his own senior advisers refuting his election fraud claims and urging him to concede his election loss, Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome.\n\nAnnotation: Mr. Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results of the election and lost all but one of them. Many of the suits, the committee determined, were brought even after some of Mr. Trump’s closest aides — including his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and his attorney general, William P. Barr — told him that there was no fraud that could have changed the outcome of the race.\n\n3. Despite knowing that such an action would be illegal, and that no state had or would submit an altered electoral slate, Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress’s joint session on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: The committee discovered that the lawyer John Eastman had advised Mr. Trump to undertake a campaign to push Mr. Pence into single-handedly deciding the election in his favor even though there was evidence that Mr. Eastman knew the plan was illegal. Some of Mr. Pence’s own aides told Mr. Trump the same, but he pressured Mr. Pence nonetheless.\n\n4. Donald Trump sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice by attempting to enlist department officials to make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the presidential election. After that effort failed, Donald Trump offered the position of acting attorney general to Jeff Clark knowing that Clark intended to disseminate false information aimed at overturning the election.\n\nAnnotation: After leaders in the Justice Department — including Jeffrey Rosen, the acting attorney general, and Richard Donoghue, his deputy — told Mr. Trump that he was wrong about his claims concerning fraud in the election, Mr. Trump wanted to appoint Mr. Clark, a loyalist, to run the department. Mr. Clark had promised to send out letters to leaders in key swing states saying that prosecutors had in fact found fraud in the election. The president decided not to appoint Mr. Clark only after several senior department officials threatened to quit if he did.\n\n5. Without any evidentiary basis and contrary to state and federal law, Donald Trump unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states.\n\nAnnotation: In the weeks that followed the election, Mr. Trump and his allies had calls and meetings with local officials in key swing states like Michigan and Arizona in which they pressured the officials to use their powers to assign electors from the states to him. More famously, Mr. Trump also asked Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, to help him “find” the 11,000 votes he needed to win the election there.\n\n6. Donald Trump oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nAnnotation: This refers to one of Mr. Trump’s most expansive schemes to maintain his grip on power: a plan to have state officials create and submit fake electors pledged to him in seven swing states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n7. Donald Trump pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states.\n\nAnnotation: The committee found that Mr. Trump also played a role in a plan closely related to the fake-electors scheme: He helped to persuade 139 House Republicans to dispute the Electoral College count on the day the Capitol was attacked.\n\n8. Donald Trump purposely verified false information filed in federal court.\n\nAnnotation: In December 2020, Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit in Fulton County, Ga., contending that thousands of votes had been improperly counted and citing specific numbers of dead people, felons and unregistered voters who had cast ballots. Mr. Trump signed an official attestation attached to the suit swearing that the data in it was accurate despite the fact that one of his own lawyers, Mr. Eastman, had determined it was false.\n\n9. Based on false allegations that the election was stolen, Donald Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for Jan. 6. Although these supporters were angry and some were armed, Donald Trump instructed them to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to “take back” their country.\n\nAnnotation: The committee determined that a tweet posted by Mr. Trump on Dec. 19, 2020, announcing a “wild” protest in Washington on Jan. 6 was heard as a clarion call by both far-right extremists and ordinary Trump supporters who sprang into action preparing for the event. When they got to Washington for the rally, Mr. Trump’s speech calling on them to “fight like hell” was a central driver in sending them on toward the Capitol.\n\n10. Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: The tweet the committee is referring to here said, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.” Court papers show that some rioters at the Capitol responded directly to it by pushing toward and ultimately into the building.\n\n11. Knowing that violence was underway at the Capitol, and despite his duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, Donald Trump refused repeated requests over a multiple-hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television. This failure to act perpetuated the violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress’s proceeding to count electoral votes.\n\nAnnotation: The committee accused Mr. Trump of “a dereliction of duty” for letting nearly three hours pass between learning that the Capitol was under siege and calling for his supporters to leave the Capitol grounds. During that time, several people close to him — including his daughter Ivanka — begged Mr. Trump to issue a statement that would calm down the crowd.\n\n12. Each of these actions by Donald Trump was taken in support of a multipart conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n13. The intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did successfully detect the planning for potential violence on Jan. 6, including planning specifically by the Proud Boys and Oath Keeper militia groups who ultimately led the attack on the Capitol. As Jan. 6 approached, the intelligence specifically identified the potential for violence at the Capitol. This intelligence was shared within the executive branch, including with the Secret Service and the president’s National Security Council.\n\n14. Intelligence gathered in advance of Jan. 6 did not support a conclusion that antifa or other left-wing groups would likely engage in a violent counterdemonstration, or attack Trump supporters on Jan. 6. Indeed, intelligence from Jan. 5 indicated that some left-wing groups were instructing their members to “stay at home” and not attend on Jan. 6. Ultimately, none of these groups was involved to any material extent with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n15. Neither the intelligence community nor law enforcement obtained intelligence in advance of Jan. 6 on the full extent of the ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results. Such agencies apparently did not (and potentially could not) anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer the crowd in his Ellipse speech, that President Trump would “spontaneously” instruct the crowd to march to the Capitol, that President Trump would exacerbate the violent riot by sending his 2:24 p.m. tweet condemning Vice President Pence, or the full scale of the violence and lawlessness that would ensue. Nor did law enforcement anticipate that President Trump would refuse to direct his supporters to leave the Capitol once violence began. No intelligence community advance analysis predicted exactly how President Trump would behave; no such analysis recognized the full scale and extent of the threat to the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation for 13, 14 and 15: The committee has faced criticism, especially from Republicans, for not focusing more attention on the failures by intelligence and law enforcement officials on Jan. 6 and in the weeks leading up to the Capitol attack. But the panel did present some preliminary findings and may ultimately issue a separate report.\n\n16. Hundreds of Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan Police officers performed their duties bravely on Jan. 6, and America owes those individual immense gratitude for their courage in the defense of Congress and our constitution. Without their bravery, Jan. 6 would have been far worse. Although certain members of the Capitol Police leadership regarded their approach to Jan. 6 as “all hands on deck” the Capitol Police leadership did not have sufficient assets in place to address the violent and lawless crowd. Capitol Police leadership did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensue after President Trump instructed tens of thousands of his supporters in the Ellipse crowd to march to the Capitol, and then tweeted at 2:24 p.m. Although Chief Steven Sund raised the idea of National Guard support, the Capitol Police Board did not request Guard assistance prior to Jan. 6. The Metropolitan Police took an even more proactive approach to Jan. 6, and deployed roughly 800 officers, including responding to the emergency calls for help at the Capitol. Rioters still managed to break their line in certain locations, when the crowd surged forward in the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump’s 2:24 p.m. tweet. The Department of Justice readied a group of federal agents at Quantico and in the District of Columbia, anticipating that Jan. 6 could become violent, and then deployed those agents once it became clear that police at the Capitol were overwhelmed. Agents from the Department of Homeland Security were also deployed to assist.\n\n17. President Trump had authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on Jan. 6 or on any other day. Nor did he instruct any federal law enforcement agency to assist. Because the authority to deploy the National Guard had been delegated to the Department of Defense, the secretary of defense could, and ultimately did, deploy the Guard. Although evidence identifies a likely miscommunication between members of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense impacting the timing of deployment, the committee has found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard. The select committee recognizes that some at the department had genuine concerns, counseling caution, that President Trump might give an illegal order to use the military in support of his efforts to overturn the election.\n\nAnnotation: The question of why it took so long to deploy the National Guard to the Capitol is one of the enduring mysteries of Jan. 6. While the committee sharply criticized Mr. Trump for failing to taking action that day, it also found that there was no evidence the deployment of the Guard was delayed for political reasons.\n\nThe panel voted 9 to 0 to accept the final report and to urge the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against Mr. Trump and his allies in four separate areas of the law.\n\nHere are some takeaways:\n\nThe committee kept its focus on Trump.\n\nThe committee’s hourlong presentation focused almost exclusively on Mr. Trump, essentially ignoring findings about intelligence and security failures at the Capitol before and during the attack. The committee also did not dwell on the information it collected about the rise of domestic extremism.\n\nThe focus on Mr. Trump had been telegraphed for months as the committee drafted its final report, using it primarily as a means to hold Mr. Trump to account for his actions in trying to prevent the orderly transfer of power after a presidential election. As Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a Republican and the panel’s vice chairwoman, put it: “Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one.”\n\nIn one place, the report laid out the facts of how Trump attempted to stay in power.\n\nThe summary of the committee’s final report is a remarkable account of a president’s desperate attempt to stay in office following his election loss to Mr. Biden in 2020.\n\nWhile it breaks no new ground since the panel’s series of public hearings this summer, the report for the first time brings together all the facts in one place.\n\nThe report states that even people around Mr. Trump “ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful.”\n\nThe report laid out, step by step, how Mr. Trump sought to cling to power after losing the 2020 election: first, by lying about widespread fraud, despite being told his claims were false; by organizing false slates of electors in states won by Mr. Biden; by pressuring state officials, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election; and finally, by amassing a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol, where they engaged in hours of bloody violence while Mr. Trump did nothing to call them off.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straightforward conclusion: The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the report states. “None of the events of Jan. 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nThe committee revealed new details from two top advisers: Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway.\n\nThe committee revealed on Monday the investigative work it had done since the end of their previous hearings. That included the panel’s first interviews with two of the former president’s top advisers: Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway.\n\nMs. Hicks, who served as a senior adviser in the White House, said that when she raised concerns with the former president about the actions on Jan. 6 affecting Mr. Trump’s legacy, he responded that “nobody will care about my legacy if I lose. So, that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning.”\n\nThe committee also revealed testimony from Ms. Conway, who described telling Mr. Trump that Jan. 6 was a “terrible day.” She recalled him responding: “No. People are upset. They are very upset.”\n\nThe events of Jan. 6 hurt Trump but did not knock him out of 2024 contention.\n\nThe work of the committee over the past year has already helped to chip away at Mr. Trump’s political standing and his reputation as the nation’s 45th president. Ms. Cheney said again on Monday that Mr. Trump should never “serve in any position of authority in our nation again. He is unfit for any office.”\n\nAnd yet, Mr. Trump already has announced his pursuit of the presidency again, hoping to reclaim the office he falsely asserts was stolen from him. Despite a rocky campaign announcement and a swirl of potential criminal prosecutions, Mr. Trump remains a central figure in the Republican Party, with strong support across the country. And he has weathered setbacks, both political and legal, before.\n\nThe committee’s legacy is still an open question.\n\nThe legacy of the Jan. 6 committee is now out of the panel’s hands, and will most likely be determined by federal prosecutors in the coming months. It will be up to Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed to oversee investigations into Mr. Trump’s actions, to determine whether the information sent over by the committee, along with the Justice Department’s own material, warrants charging the former president with any crimes.\n\nThat remains an open question. Members of the committee were firm on Monday in their belief that Mr. Trump and the people around him violated four statutes in the planning and execution of the Capitol attack. They are: obstructing or influencing an official proceeding; conspiring against the U.S. government; making false statements to the government; and engaging in insurrection against the government.\n\nPursuing those charges, or others, against Mr. Trump would be a historic effort to hold the nation’s top official accountable for his actions. But it will be up to the special counsel, and ultimately Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, to decide whether to move forward. Other Justice Department officials will have to decide whether to charge Mr. Trump’s aides as committee members called for.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are already gearing up to discredit the committee when they take control of the House in January. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, who is seeking to become the speaker next year, has vowed to investigate the committee’s work and has demanded that the staff and lawmakers preserve records for that purpose.\n\nThe committee has not been a political boon for many of its members.\n\nThe end of the Jan. 6 committee is also the end of the House careers of four of the nine members of the panel.\n\nTwo of them — Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, and Representative Stephanie Murphy, Democrat of Florida — decided not to run for re-election in 2022. Mr. Kinzinger faced fierce opposition from within his own party because of his frequent criticism of Mr. Trump and his decision to be part of the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nTwo others — Ms. Cheney and Representative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia — lost their House seats in 2022. Ms. Cheney was defeated in her primary campaign in Wyoming after drawing the ire of party officials and voters for her opposition to Mr. Trump and her determination to hold him accountable for Jan. 6. Ms. Luria was defeated in the general election in Virginia.\n\nAll four have said they have no regrets about serving on the committee. But it is unlikely to serve as a political steppingstone for many of its members.\n\nThe panel’s recommendations that charges should be brought were based on an exhaustive investigation that spanned months and included interviews with key witnesses that even federal prosecutors may not have spoken to yet.\n\nIn presenting the committee’s findings, Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said he did not want the “foot soldiers” who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to go to jail while “the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass.”\n\nMr. Raskin explained that charges were warranted against Mr. Trump and others — chief among them the lawyer John Eastman, an architect of several plans to overturn Mr. Trump’s defeat. Nine months ago, Mr. Raskin noted, a federal judge in California, ruling in a civil case, concluded that there was evidence that Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman had conspired together to commit federal crimes.\n\nAs for the Justice Department’s efforts, not much is publicly known about any specific charges that the special counsel, Jack Smith, might be considering in a criminal prosecution. The department is under no obligation to adopt the committee’s conclusions or to follow its recommendations.\n\nStill, there has been some overlap between criminal statutes cited by the department and the charges the committee recommended, according to search warrants and subpoenas that have gradually surfaced during the federal inquiry.\n\nOne charge that both the panel and prosecutors have placed at the center of their work is obstruction of an official proceeding before Congress. The Justice Department mentioned that count in a warrant used in June to seize the cellphone of Jeffrey Clark, a former department official whom the committee referred for criminal charges on Monday.\n\nProsecutors have already used the obstruction count in nearly 300 criminal cases to describe how the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 disrupted the certification of the election that was taking place there during a joint session of Congress.\n\nDespite its wide use, the statute was never an easy fit for the violence that erupted at the Capitol.\n\nIt was passed into law as part of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which sought to curb corporate malfeasance by clamping down on things like shredding documents and tampering with witnesses. And defense lawyers have challenged its use in a federal appeals court in Washington, arguing that prosecutors stretched it beyond its original scope and used it to criminalize behavior that closely resembles protest protected by the First Amendment.\n\nStill, the obstruction count could apply much better to Mr. Trump’s behavior than to that of hundreds of ordinary rioters.\n\nThe law requires proving that any interference with a congressional proceeding be done “corruptly.” The committee said in its recommendations that Mr. Trump had clearly acted with a “‘corrupt’ purpose” because he was warned in advance that several of his schemes to maintain his grip on power were illegal.\n\nThe committee also recommended that Mr. Trump and others be charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, a count that has been used in several Justice Department cases against both far-right extremists and ordinary rioters who appeared to have planned in advance to storm the Capitol.\n\nAgain, this conspiracy charge may in fact better describe the evidence against Mr. Trump, who, according to the committee, defrauded the public by making constant false claims that the election had been rigged against him.\n\nAnother charge the committee recommended against Mr. Trump and others was conspiracy to make false statements. That count, according to the panel, was warranted because Mr. Trump took part in a wide-ranging scheme to send to Congress and the National Archives fake slates of electors declaring that he was the victor in several key states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nThe most serious charge the panel has recommended against Mr. Trump is also likely to be the hardest to prove: insurrection. While the Justice Department has won a conviction on a related charge, seditious conspiracy, against Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia, and is set to try five members of another far-right group, the Proud Boys, for sedition, it has not charged anyone with insurrection in more than 900 criminal cases.\n\nStill, a federal judge in Washington laid the ground for a potential insurrection case against Mr. Trump in a ruling in February that permitted a series of Jan. 6-related civil cases filed against the former president to move forward.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge, Amit P. Mehta, said Mr. Trump was not merely exercising his First Amendment right to free speech when he called on the crowd listening to him on Jan. 6 to march on the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n\nJudge Mehta also found that there was a reasonable case to be made that Mr. Trump had aided and abetted those in the mob who assaulted the police at the Capitol — in part by waiting so long to call publicly for the rioters to calm down. One of the ways prosecutors could prove that Mr. Trump engaged in insurrection is by showing that he gave “aid and comfort” to other insurrectionists who took part in a rebellion against the government.'}}",95.5,1

O n a Tuesday afternoon in late April, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene walks into the seventh-floor congressional office belonging to Representative Matt Gaetz ...', 'Full_text': ""On a Tuesday afternoon in late April, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene walks into the seventh-floor congressional office belonging to Representative Matt Gaetz, settles into a high-backed black leather chair, and fits a pair of headphones over her blonde hair. The taping is about to begin for the 38th episode of Gaetz’s “Firebrand” podcast, and Greene is the high-wattage guest star.\n\nGreene has come straight from Dulles Airport, so Gaetz takes a minute to catch her up on today’s topics before the recording starts. There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her. She knows really well how to wield power.” Why vote against a man you’ve already got wrapped around your little finger?\n\n“The critique of McCarthy is not that he has ignored us, or pretended like we don’t exist,” Gaetz adds with a broad grin. “In fact, he’s highly responsive to us.”\n\nThe MAGA Squad: They’re here. They’re weird. And pretty soon, they may be in control of the GOP Congress—if they aren’t already.\n\nWith reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian""}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/4/4/23669635/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-indictment-protest', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene’s protest for Trump is a zany flop - Vox', 'Snippet': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene’s lonely, kind of zany protest for Trump. Few in the GOP attended a New York rally alongside the pro-Trump lawmaker on Tuesday. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) led a ...', 'Full_text': 'Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day. The rally, which Greene led alongside the New York Young Republicans, drew a crowd of a few dozen Trump supporters, counterprotesters, and curious New Yorkers — all of whom appeared to be outnumbered by media.\n\nThe rally in Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Court House, was less a protest and more like a bizarro carnival. Trump’s Tuesday arraignment took place on an rare New York spring day, which added to the frenetic vibe, as though everyone was unleashed after a long winter.\n\nThe MAGA hats and flags were out, as were a contingent of counterprotesters, imperfectly separated by metal barriers. New Yorkers mingled among them — an artist, a high schooler with a few free periods — who claimed to have wandered down to Lower Manhattan to witness history, or at least the spectacle. And then there were the reporters, swarming everyone in a red hat or with a halfway decent sign.\n\nBut prominent GOP politicians, not so much. The sparse attendance by other elected Republicans highlighted the limitations of what members of the party might be willing to do for Trump, even though they’ve broadly lambasted the charges against him as politically motivated and unfounded.\n\nGreene’s headlining of the event comes after Trump previously called for his supporters to “protest” the charges, a rallying cry that raised concerns of a repeat of the deadly January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when the former president similarly asked supporters to contest the election results. Embattled Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was also spotted by reporters in the crowd of the protest, and was seen headed toward the courthouse where the arraignment was set to take place. Other than that, maybe the highest-profile public figure was the Naked Cowboy.\n\nJanuary 6’s violence — and its legal fallout — have complicated efforts to drum up support for pro-Trump protests. While many lawmakers are eager to show their support for Trump, they’ve largely chosen to do so through fundraising efforts. A previous New York protest on March 20 was also poorly attended, and protests in South Carolina and California drew small crowds this past week as well. Most GOP lawmakers appear unwilling to put themselves in a position where they could be linked to Trump-related violence, and in the face of ongoing trials for insurrectionists, grassroots supporters appear hesitant to do so as well.\n\nThe New York Young Republicans pointedly described the Tuesday rally as a “peaceful protest” that called out the political persecution of Trump’s indictment, with Greene warning participants against violence. The crowd greeted Marjorie Taylor Green’s arrival to the rally with cheers and jeers, but throughout the morning until Trump’s arrival in Lower Manhattan, the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nRepublicans in general have harshly criticized the indictment and framed it as a way for Democrats to attack Trump yet again. Leaders like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), however, have previously urged “calmness” and pushed back on Trump’s calls for protest. They have assisted with the former president’s efforts to use the indictment to raise money, though. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) solicited donations on Fox News, for example, and the Trump campaign claims it’s brought in over $7 million in the past few days.\n\nThe lukewarm Republican response to Trump’s calls for protests, however, indicate that many in the GOP are only willing to go so far, particularly as the specter of the January 6 insurrection continues to loom over the party.\n\n“I think they calculate that they can take a goldilocks strategy — stay in the good graces of their base by not attacking him, but maintain plausible deniability in the future by not attending a protest,” says American University government professor David Barker.\n\nTrump is back, and no one seems to know quite what to make of it\n\nTuesday in Collect Pond Park, Trump supporters were angry about Trump’s indictment, but there was also a sense of anticipation: The thing Trump always said would happen — that he’d be targeted by an establishment that was out to get him — did. They were here to defend Trump, to support him, pray for him, and commiserate together.\n\nMelinda, 61, who drove up to New York from outside Fall’s Church, Virginia, sat on a bench in the park, hours before Trump’s arraignment. “I’m here to pray for the safety of the city and the people and President Trump,” she said.\n\nShe added that she loved her president, pointing to a pin of the presidential seal on the collar of the jacket. For her, the charges felt larger than just Trump. “What’s happening is they’re about to open a Pandora’s box. Because now, nobody’s safe,” Melinda said. “Any president, VP, Supreme Court justice, can now be publicly arrested, so I think it will boomerang.”\n\nThe crowd got bigger as the morning wore on and Trump’s arraignment loomed. There were red hats, of course, but maybe not as many as you might think. The rest fell into two camps: folks in sunglasses and T-shirts, as if they were NYC tourists; and the over-the-top. That included a guy in a banana suit — “Banana Republic” costume, as he explained — with a copy of the US Constitution in his hand.\n\nThe closer to Trump’s arraignment it got, the weirder it got, too: a woman, her body painted white, in a diaper. An Abe Lincoln. A guy in an orange jumpsuit, wearing a Trump mask. As inmate Trump worked the crowd, one woman pointed directly at him. “It’s Hillary Clinton,” she said, ignoring his face. “Hey, Hillary, you finally got locked up.”\n\nAnti-Trump protesters also filtered through. Jojo Keys, 39, from Manhattan, said he was an independent who had come to witness history. When Taylor Green entered the park, he jumped up and down, shouting “Liar, liar!”\n\nThere were also “Fuck Joe Biden” cheers and “USA” chants, and there was a cowbell, somewhere, of course. But mostly, the currency was signs. The ones you know: Make America Great, Trump 2024, Stop the Steal, Q. And then some new ones on the scene, some better than others: “Salem 1692 / Bragg 2023.” “From Build Back Better to Biden, Bragg, Banana Republic in 2 Years.”\n\nMichael Austin, a 59-year-old Manhattanite, had the Build Back Better to Banana Republic sign, which he rested at his feet. In his hands, he held a “Fags for Trump” sign. “It is a seven-year-long, slow-rolling constant coup d’etat,” Austin said. “They have used the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the DHS, and foreign spy agencies to persecute a reformer, who came to reform the corrupt system, and they don’t like it.”\n\nPretty much everyone had cameras out, filming or photographing the scene for their own memories, and maybe to make sure that they had evidence in case anything happened.\n\nThough nothing really did. People cheered, they chatted, they waited. Trump arrived at the courthouse in the afternoon, the crowd noting his arrival with helicopters overhead. “Trump is in the house,” one woman called out. But otherwise, the crowd stood, behind a fence and behind rows of television cameras, facing the court house, knowing, at least, that the former president was inside.\n\nThe lingering impact of January 6\n\nTrump’s calls for protests, which the former president posted in March as he anticipated the indictment, follow significant fallout from the January 6 insurrection. The storming of the Capitol ultimately led to five deaths, 140 injured police officers, and hundreds of arrests. It’s also proven to be politically damaging for Republicans following an intensive investigation by Congress’s January 6 committee, with polling showing that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the attack.\n\nConcerns about the violence that occurred on January 6 have hung over these potential rallies as well, with New York Mayor Eric Adams calling on Taylor Greene and other protesters to be on their “best behavior.” Multiple Republican lawmakers have made similar requests of Trump supporters, like McCarthy, who said in mid-March that “there should not be any violence.”\n\nRelatedly, pro-Trump backers have signaled reluctance about these protests amid concerns they could be a trap laid by federal agents, after more than a thousand people have been charged following the insurrection. As CNN’s Sean Lyngaas, Zachary Cohen, and Donie O’Sullivan reported, pro-Trump forums have included speculation that these demonstrations were a “set up” intended to pin blame on them for violence caused by other groups, like the antifa or antifascist movement. (On January 6, this incorrect theory was used by some Republicans to obscure the role of Trump supporters in the violence and damage that was caused.) An expert also told CNN that Trump backers may be seeking alternate routes to oppose the indictment including specific targeting of officials like District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe combination of lawmakers’ own apparent political concerns, and Trump supporters’ practical worries about a law enforcement “set up,” seem to have dampened the involvement in protests this week.\n\nFor Republican lawmakers, there’s been an ongoing balancing act regarding their backing for Trump. If they were to actively criticize and condemn him, they risk serious electoral blowback much like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who lost her Republican House primary. Tying themselves too closely to Trump, however, also comes with its own risks, particularly for lawmakers in more moderate states and districts. In the 2022 midterms, election-denier candidates in battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan broadly lost. And there are still a lot of unknowns about Trump’s legal woes, as he faces other potential charges in cases involving overturning the election results and his role in January 6.\n\n“Now they must calculate not just the current rank-and-file GOP rallying around Trump, but also what happens if more indictments tumble down in the coming months,” says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\n\nThese collective factors, it seems, have curbed the interest in these protests for now.\n\nUpdate, 5 pm ET: This story has been updated with crowd reactions throughout the arraignment day.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.vice.com/en/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-tweets-testimony/', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene to Jan. 6: I Don’t Know Her - VICE', 'Snippet': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene has an absolutely terrible memory, and very little control over her social media accounts. ...

Matt Gaetz, a right-wing ...', 'Full_text': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene has an absolutely terrible memory, and very little control over her social media accounts. That’s her story, anyway.\n\nIn a mint-green dress with a gold cross displayed prominently, the Georgia congresswoman appeared in an Atlanta courtroom Friday to testify under oath about whether she participated in an insurrection. “I don’t remember,” and “I don’t recall,” Greene testified repeatedly to straightforward questions on whether she’d talked about the Jan. 6 protest with other members of Congress, or any “Stop the Steal” organizers before the Capitol riot.\n\nGreene is facing a challenge from a group of constituents in her northwest Georgia district who say her alleged role in the violent Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol should disqualify her from running for re-election. The challenge was brought under a Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment that says officials who engage in “insurrection or rebellion” or have “given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof” should be barred from holding political office.\n\nThe question at the heart of the case is what an insurrection looks like in the year 2021—whether the Capitol riot fits that definition, and whether Greene’s words and conduct before, during, and after the attack make her culpable.\n\nFriday’s proceedings marked the first time a member of Congress has testified publicly, under oath, about their involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nAdministrative law judge Charles Beaudrot agreed to recognize the congresswoman as a “hostile witness,” after she repeatedly refused to answer or evaded questions about her social media posts and belief in the conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was “stolen” from former president Donald Trump.\n\nGreene even dodged questions about how she uses Twitter and Facebook and said she couldn’t recall specific incendiary messages she shared from her social media accounts prior to Jan. 6.\n\nShe also repeated false claims about a “tremendous amount of voter fraud” in the 2020 election, but asserted that it was “not accurate” that she hoped Congress would not certify Joe Biden as the election’s winner.\n\nGreene’s supporters packed the courtroom and cheered when she entered. They also clapped when Beaudrot dismissed the court for a break later in the morning. “This is not a show,” Beaudrot scolded them. “Do not do that.” Notable among Greene’s supporters present was Rep. Matt Gaetz, a right-wing congressman from Florida.\n\n“This was not a case where leaders were on horseback leading the charge,” said Ron Fein, legal director for Free Speech for People, a left-leaning civil liberties group, who cross-examined Greene. “The leaders were not standing in Richmond, Virginia, giving long-winded speeches to justify the mayhem. The leaders of this insurrection were among us, on Twitter, on Facebook. The evidence will show that Marjorie Taylor Greene was one of them.”\n\nGreene’s attorney, James Bopp Jr., called the legal challenge a “political smear” campaign against the controversial congresswoman, and asserted that Fein was glossing over key legal definitions of “insurrection” or “engaged.”\n\nFein asked Greene whether she thought if someone “broke the law in a way designed to interfere with the process of counting Electoral College votes,” would they be “an enemy of the constitution.”\n\n“You mean interrupting Congress?” replied Greene. “Interrupting Congress, like when the Democrats interrupted Congress and staged a sit-in?”\n\nShe also testified that she had no expectation of violence on Jan. 6. “I have never once seen violence from Trump people,” she claimed. “The only violence I had seen from antifa and BLM rallies.”\n\nFein, amid numerous objections from Bopp, grilled Greene about specific social media posts and past remarks—and likes of posts.\n\n“You’ve had your disagreements with [Nancy] Pelosi, right?” asked Fein.\n\n“Politically speaking, that would be correct,” Greene replied.\n\n“You don’t agree on a lot of things?” asked Fein. “Politically speaking, that would be correct,” she repeated.\n\n“You think Pelosi is a traitor to the country,” he said. “I’m not answering that question; it’s speculation,” she said.\n\nFein then pulled up an exhibit that showed Greene saying Pelosi was “a traitor to our country, guilty of treason.” He also asked her about a Facebook comment she appeared to “like” that said a “bullet to the head” would be a quicker way to remove Pelosi from office. “I have had many people manage my social media account,” said Greene, adding that she didn’t know who liked that one.\n\n“Are you testifying under oath that wasn’t you?” asked Fein.\n\n“I am testifying I had no idea who liked that comment,” Greene replied.\n\nFein also pointed to a CNN article (prompting snickers from the courtroom), quoting 2019 remarks by Greene (in the context of a protest to fund the Southern border wall), in which she said a good way for people to express their displeasure with the government is to “flood the Capitol.”\n\n“The Capitol belongs to the people,” she replied. When Fein read out additional comments from 2019 where Greene talked about the need to “rise up” and hoping “the American people” wouldn’t be forced to use non-peaceful means, she denied making them.\n\nGreene called Fein a “conspiracy theorist” by reading statements that were quoted in CNN, and said that the news outlet regularly prints lies about her. Fein then played a video that showed her making those same remarks, verbatim.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-marjorie-taylor-greene-protests-new-york-city-arraignment-president-indictment/', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene joins protests in New York City, chants with ...', 'Snippet': 'GOP Reps.

Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email.

Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/factchecking-claims-about-the-jan-6-capitol-riot/', 'Headline': 'FactChecking Claims About the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot', 'Snippet': 'Trump supporters clash with police and security forces at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. ... responsible for the breakdown of security.” ... to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/12/21/house-gop-report-faults-nancy-pelosi-for-jan-6-security-failures/', 'Headline': 'House GOP report faults Nancy Pelosi for Jan. 6 security failures', 'Snippet': 'House Republicans issued a scathing report Wednesday exposing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s key role in the catastrophic security and intelligence failures that left the U.S. Capitol vulnerable ...', 'Full_text': 'House Republicans issued a scathing report Wednesday exposing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s key role in the catastrophic security and intelligence failures that left the US Capitol vulnerable to a violent attack on January 6, 2021.\n\nDays after Pelosi’s Jan. 6 select committee recommended insurrection charges against former president Donald Trump over the Capitol riot, Republicans have hit back with a counter-investigation apportioning blame for the internal security breakdown on Jan. 6 to Pelosi and a dysfunctional Capitol Police intelligence division.\n\n“Leadership and law enforcement failures within the U.S. Capitol left the complex vulnerable on January 6, 2021,” says the report, which is based on a trove of texts and email messages, and testimony from Capitol Police leaders and rank-and-file officers.\n\nHouse Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving, who answered to Pelosi as one of three voting members of the Capitol Police Board, “succumbed to political pressures from the Office of Speaker Pelosi and House Democrat leadership,” was “compromised by politics and did not adequately prepare for violence at the Capitol.”\n\nPelosi and her staff “coordinated closely” with Irving on security plans for the Joint Session of Congress on Jan. 6, but Republicans were deliberately left out of “important discussions related to security.”\n\nAnd, in an apparent attempt to hide from Republicans the fact that they were being excluded from discussions, Irving asked a senior Democratic staffer to “act surprised” when he sent “key information about plans for the Joint Session on Jan. 6, 2021, to him and his Republican counterpart.”\n\nThe staffer replied sardonically: “I’m startled!”\n\nThe report also claims that “staff within the House Sergeant at Arms office emailed Paul Irving that January 6th was Pelosi’s fault,” although it provides no evidence for the assertion.\n\nWhen Irving was forced to resign after the riot, an email from an unnamed staffer in his office criticized Pelosi’s “knee-jerk reaction to yesterday’s unprecedented event” and described his resignation as “spectacularly unjust, unfair, and unwarranted. This is not your fault. Or [Capitol Police chief Steven] Sund’s fault.”\n\nThe Republicans responsible for the withering report — Jim Banks (R-IN), Jim Jordan (R-OH), Rodney Davis (R-IL), Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) and Troy Nehls (R-TX) — are the five congressmen originally nominated to sit on the Jan. 6 committee, until Pelosi vetoed Banks and Jordan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled the rest of his nominees in protest. Pelosi then installed two Never Trump Republican outcasts, Liz Cheney, and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nGiven Pelosi’s assiduous grooming of Cheney, no doubt it suited both their interests to focus the final Jan.6 committee report on Trump — and not on Pelosi’s culpability.\n\nBut now the Republicans Pelosi rejected have skewered her in their rival report, dredging up some of what she tried to hide, despite complaining of obstruction from the personnel she controls.\n\nThe report insinuates that the Speaker left the Capitol Police without backup on Jan. 6 because “widespread concern from Democratic leadership over ‘optics’ in the aftermath of the Summer 2020 ‘Black Lives Matter’ protests prevented early deployment of the National Guard.”\n\nChief Sund begged repeatedly for troops but has testified that Irving rebuffed him over concern about “optics.” During the violence on Jan. 6, Sund repeated his request, but help was delayed until after the riot ended, because Irving needed to run it up the chain of command, a.k.a. Pelosi.\n\n“The Speaker’s office was heavily involved in planning and decision-making before and during the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and micromanaged the Sergeant at Arms.”\n\nFrom early December 2020, Pelosi aides attended regular meetings with Irving and Sund to discuss the security plan. So hands-on was Pelosi’s chief of staff Terri McCullough that, at one point, she was editing details of parking, event timing and “language regarding official business visitors” for the Joint Session.\n\nTo illustrate the intense involvement of Pelosi’s office, on Jan. 6 alone, the report records 36 communications between Irving and Pelosi staffers, including 11 with McCullough, and 20 with Jamie Fleet, a Pelosi aide who doubled as a Democratic staff director.\n\nPelosi’s repeated assertions that she has “no power over the Capitol Police” are rejected.\n\n“This is false,” says the report. “Documents provided by [current] House Sergeant at Arms show how then-House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving carried out his duties in clear deference to the Speaker, her staff, and other Democratic staff . . .\n\n“House Rules dictate . . . that the Sergeant at Arms is to report directly to the Speaker of the House.”\n\nIndeed, the report says that Pelosi regularly exercised her authority over security matters, “when she directed the use of magnetometers outside the House chamber in the name of safety . . . Similarly, she required masks in the House chamber [and] exerted influence on security protocols at the Capitol related to the perimeter fence . . . She also oversaw the fencing that was erected for a purported rally on September 18, 2021, that never materialized.”\n\nThe report of the Republican refuseniks is an appetizer to potential future investigations next year when they regain subpoena power. It makes sensible recommendations to prevent another disaster, including reform and oversight of the Capitol Police Board.\n\nFar from being a revenge ploy, it identifies security flaws it claims have not been remedied, including the breakdown of intelligence that had the Capitol Police (USCP) flying blind and hopelessly outnumbered when “criminal rioters assaulted police officers, broke into the U.S. Capitol, damaged property, and temporarily interfered with … the Joint Session of Congress.”\n\nThe Capitol Police Intelligence Division “failed to warn USCP leadership and line officers about the threat of violence,” despite having “obtained sufficient information from an array of channels to anticipate and prepare for the violence.”\n\nIn fact, the final intelligence threat assessment three days before the riot did warn of a violent scenario in which “Congress itself” could be attacked by armed Trump supporters. But the warning was buried towards the end of the 15-page document and was not included in the up-front summary, so was overlooked. Nor was the warning mentioned in three subsequent daily intelligence reports.\n\nThe Republicans blame much of the intelligence failure on the assistant director of the USCP intelligence division, Julie Farnam, who had joined the Capitol Police from the Department of Homeland Security only 10 weeks before the riot.\n\nAnalysts testified that “the section became ‘nonfunctional’ immediately upon Farnam’s arrival as she tried to “consolidate power for herself to the detriment of the safety and security of the Capitol.”\n\n“Documents and testimony show that, immediately upon joining the USCP, and without time to acclimate, Farnam began to dismantle the systems that had kept the Capitol safe for so long,” the report alleges.\n\n“Information about planned protests and threats of violence were siloed and not properly analyzed and disseminated during this key period because of Farnam’s misplaced priorities.”\n\nOne analyst testified: “at the time of January 6, we were not doing proactive searches of social media like we had been before. We were strictly reactive.”\n\nAs a result, USCP leadership “were not fully informed about the severity of the threats against the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021”.\n\nHowever, Farnam told CBS this year that her team does not bear any responsibility for the attack on the Capitol and provided adequate threat assessments to police leadership before the riot.\n\n“I think we did an excellent job . . . I am the one who has worked tirelessly . . . to right this ship.”\n\nAfter cataloguing so many tragic failures, the report concludes on a poignant note with messages to Irving from friends in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol.\n\n“You’re quite something to take this one for the team, Paul, as they say. I know how these things work and you know I do, too.”'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/jan-6-pelosi-schumer-capitol-riot-video-201232951.html', 'Headline': 'Dramatic new Jan. 6 footage shows Pelosi and Schumer calling ... - Yahoo', 'Snippet': ""A violent mob of President Donald Trump's supporters storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

This is Nancy,” Pelosi said in a call to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. “I don't know if you had been approached about the Virginia National Guard … but I still think you probably need the OK of the federal government in order to come into another jurisdiction.\n\n“Oh, my God, they're just breaking windows or doing all kinds of — it's really that somebody, they said somebody was shot,” she continued. “It's just horrendous, and all at the instigation of the president of the United States.”\n\nSchumer urged Rosen to get Trump to put out a statement calling off the mob.\n\n“Why don't you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility?” Schumer asked. “A public statement that they should all leave.”\n\n“They're breaking windows and going in, obviously ransacking our offices and all the rest of that.

A villain.\n\nIn his June 3 Facebook post, that’s how conservative activist Benny Johnson described Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for her role on Jan. 6, 2021 — the day a crowd of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nNewly released Jan. 6, 2021, footage shows the then-House speaker, her staff and security detail walking through the corridors of the Capitol. Johnson claimed that footage proved Pelosi had a nefarious role in the incident.\n\n“She had a camera crew follow her around on January 6th,” he wrote. “New tapes show her waiting to stage her escape until the camera man (her daughter) said, ‘Action!’ It was all a movie. It was a script. It was all planned.”\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\nJohnson did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but the new footage he appears to have referred to was posted on Just The News, a conservative website founded by John Solomon, a journalist and opinion writer whose past work has furthered unproven narratives.\n\nThe video, which Solomon described as Capitol Police security footage that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy “made available” to Just The News, has no sound. It shows Pelosi walking through the corridors alongside members of her staff and security personnel. In the video, a woman who remains just steps away from Pelosi appears to be recording with a hand-held camera. Just The News identified that woman as Pelosi’s daughter Alexandra Pelosi.\n\nIt has been publicly reported by multiple news organizations that Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker, filmed her mother during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. This isn’t unusual. Fox News reported that she has filmed her mother at the Capitol for decades.\n\nIn October 2022, Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact there wasn’t a camera crew that day — just Alexandra Pelosi with a small, hand-held camera that she always carries.\n\nThe security camera footage posted by Just The News supports Hammill’s assertion.\n\nThe clips do not prove that the events on Jan. 6, 2021, were part of a scripted plan. During years of reporting on the attack, PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that the attack was contrived.\n\nFueled partly by the false belief that the presidential election had been stolen, hundreds of people — many clad in Trump-branded apparel, others in helmets and combat gear, some armed with weapons — stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, aiming to stop the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nRioters scaled walls, broke windows, forced their way into the building and repeatedly clashed with police. One woman was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer during the attack. The siege forced lawmakers to evacuate and temporarily delayed the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nSince the attack, more than 1,000 people have faced federal charges for crimes ranging from obstruction of Congress to using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Of those, more than 580 people have pleaded guilty and 514 have been sentenced, according to an NPR analysis.\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. Capitol’s top operations and maintenance official told lawmakers that the costs of the riot — including repairs, increased security and the provision of mental health services — would exceed $30 million.\n\nFalsehoods about the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including claims that it was a false flag, were named PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year. In the years since, we’ve continued fact-checking false claims about the attack; it was a real event with real consequences.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claimed “new tapes” of Nancy Pelosi show Jan. 6 “was all planned.”\n\nNewly released security camera footage captured on Jan. 6, 2021, shows Nancy Pelosi being filmed by her daughter, documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, during the Capitol attack. The footage does not prove the attack was scripted or planned, and we found no credible evidence to support that claim.\n\nThe attack was real; it caused millions of dollars in damage and prompted hundreds of arrests.\n\nWe rate these claims False.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/politics/security-failures-january-6-committee-blue-team/index.html', 'Headline': 'January 6 committee probes security failures as GOP counter ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Davis recently wrote to Pelosi to say his team had reviewed Capitol Hill security footage in the lead-up to January 6, 2021, and found no evidence of Republican lawmakers organizing ...', 'Full_text': 'More than 80 officials from law enforcement and federal agencies have testified to the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, including members of the Secret Service, in what investigators believe will be the most extensive review yet of security failures that led to the US Capitol breach.\n\nThe House select committee’s so-called “blue team” is focused on understanding the threats leading up to attack, how intelligence was shared among law enforcement and their preparations. In addition to depositions, the team has thousands of documents from more than a dozen agencies that other security reviews didn’t have, two committee aides tell CNN.\n\nWhile much of what the Democrat-led committee has made public so far has centered around the plotting by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election, aides and lawmakers say this behind-the-scenes review might lead to the bulk of their legislative recommendations and have the most lasting impact.\n\n“We really need to bear down on those things that we think need to be done from strengthening the windows, so they’re unbreakable, all the way up to potential reforms of the electoral count act and protection of the right to vote,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat on the committee. “We need to spend some real time talking about the policy recommendations and dimension of this.”\n\nAt the same time, Republicans have launched their own investigation into security lapses on January 6, 2021, and plan to release recommendations. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and GOP lawmakers involved in the effort have made clear they will focus, at least in part, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s role.\n\n“The reports that come out of the select committee are based upon anything that’s anti-President Trump,” said Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican who has used his position as the ranking member on the House Administration Committee to look into security issues.\n\nThe competing investigations underscore that January 6 remains a polarizing issue – turning even typically nonpartisan issues like security into partisan flash points – and that questions remain about how breakdowns happened and what improvements can be made to ensure such an attack never happens again.\n\nSecurity lapses scrutinized\n\nOver the past year, several reviews have examined various aspects of law enforcement failures, but some ran into challenges collecting information and none has been able to fully assess the federal, local and congressional response as a whole.\n\nFor example, congressional aides who worked on a Senate report released in June said that federal law enforcement agencies didn’t provide all of the information investigators requested. And the Capitol Police inspector general produced several reports but noted investigators spoke to about 35 officers, despite efforts to interview dozens more.\n\nThe inspectors general from the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security also plan to produce reports on their findings.\n\nThe House select committee’s blue team review is much broader than previous ones, aides say.\n\n“There’s a tremendous amount of more information that we have, that the Senate report did not have or any of the IG reports do not have in terms of the amount of interviews we’ve conducted,” one of the aides told CNN.\n\nThe committee’s sweeping probe includes several investigative teams, each with their own color designation. The green team, for example, is tasked with tracking money, including the funding behind the pro-Trump rallies that preceded the attack. In all, they have interviewed more than 750 people and subpoenaed thousands of records.\n\nIn contrast to the work of other teams, some of whom have had to confront recalcitrant witnesses and lawsuits seeking to block their subpoenas, the aide said witnesses for the blue team have been cooperative – and largely content to stay out of the public eye.\n\n“I don’t have folks storming out of my (depositions) and then going to the press,” the aide said.\n\n“It’s just it’s people who are genuinely concerned about what happened and want to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”\n\nAides say the witnesses have included current and former law enforcement officials, from first responders to high-ranking officers, and from the Secret Service, which has publicly revealed little about their operations that day.\n\nThe team expects to propose legislative fixes as well as administrative changes related to law enforcement and physical security at the Capitol.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a member of the committee, told CNN those proposals could address streamlining the process by which the Capitol Police chief gets approval to call on the National Guard, which led to issues on January 6, and how intelligence-gathering and information-sharing happens across various agencies. As chair of the House Administration Committee, which oversees Capitol Police, Lofgren has already spearheaded efforts to improve Capitol security.\n\n“Along with the entire investigation, we want to know everything that led up to and on the day of the 6th,” Lofgren said. “Now, part of that obviously is the law enforcement preparation for January 6, how they responded to the riot as it was happening, the shortcomings, and what recommendations we want to improve the situation in the future.”\n\nGOP investigation\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, McCarthy pledged last year that Republicans would pursue their own “investigation of the facts” after Pelosi rejected his picks to sit on the House Select Committee. Since then, two of the three Republicans vetoed by Pelosi have quietly undertaken the task.\n\nDavis and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana have teamed up to informally investigate security failures. No Republican member can subpoena witness testimony or documents without the help of Democrats, so any information they have collected has been through voluntary cooperation.\n\nDavis declined to specify who he and his fellow Republicans have interviewed or what documents they’ve collected but noted several whistleblowers have come forward through a website his committee launched in the months following the riot. Davis said he doesn’t have faith the House select committee will dig deeply enough.\n\n“I don’t think enough focus is going to be placed upon the failures of the security apparatus pre-January 6 that needs to be investigated,” Davis said, recalling that he got a security briefing from Capitol Police on January 5 in his office. “There was nothing in that briefing that would have led me to believe that I would have witnessed what I saw on January 6.”\n\nTwo sources close to the GOP investigation say they have interviewed dozens of witnesses, including rank-and-file law enforcement and top brass. Their report may be timed to coincide with the House Select Committee’s public hearings, the sources said – illustrating that they see their investigative effort as a counterweight to the committee’s work.\n\nDavis recently wrote to Pelosi to say his team had reviewed Capitol Hill security footage in the lead-up to January 6, 2021, and found no evidence of Republican lawmakers organizing “reconnaissance” tours as has been previously suggested by certain Democratic members.\n\nLofgren said Republicans are politicizing the issue of Capitol Hill security and discredited the GOP notion that Pelosi is somehow responsible for any breakdowns.\n\n“It’s obviously B.S., and it’s totally motivated by their effort to turn everything into a political game,” Lofgren said.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-transcripts-detail-numerous-warning-signs-potential-violence-cap-rcna63647', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 transcripts detail numerous warning signs of potential for ...', 'Snippet': 'The Jan. 6 committee transcripts detailed the challenges facing the FBI in the lead-up to Jan. 6.

For the most part, Jan. 6 committee leaders decided against focusing the final report on how law enforcement came to be so underprepared for the attack.\n\nThe new revelations add to a growing body of evidence from news reports and court proceedings that illustrate how federal law enforcement officials were in possession of ample information that indicated Jan. 6 was going to be violent. As NBC News first reported last month, staffers were informed that chapters prepared by committee staff — including material focused on law enforcement and intelligence failures — would be cut from the final version.\n\nAmong the revelations from the transcripts: One FBI employee wrote in a Dec. 26, 2020, memo about planning for Jan. 6 that was unfolding on a pro-Trump forum called TheDonald.\n\n“They think they will have a large enough group to march into DC armed, and it will outnumber the police so they can’t be stopped,"" read the notification in the eGuardian system, which is meant to help federal, state and local law enforcement officials coordinate. ""They believe that since the election was stolen, that it’s their constitutional right to over take the government and during this coup no U.S. laws apply. Another group of Proud Boys will be in DC already and are planning on blocking the roads with their cars in order to stop traffic.""\n\nNBC News previously reported that one of the FBI’s own confidential sources informed the bureau on the day that Trump sent his Dec. 19, 2020, “will be wild” tweet about Jan. 6 that far-right groups saw it as a “call to arms.” The FBI received numerous tips about the potential for violence on Jan. 6, including from the son of a Texas man who ultimately came to the Capitol with a gun, and the bureau briefed other law enforcement entities about threats, including intelligence that suggested the Oath Keepers had set up armed ""quick reaction forces"" in Virginia that were set to come into D.C. at Trump\'s command. Two members of the Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy at a trial that ended last month, and three others pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee transcripts detailed the challenges facing the FBI in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Days before the attack, the FBI lost use of the program it had been using to track threats on social media, as the bureau transitioned to a new product to gather open source information. An FBI intelligence analyst raised concerns about that on New Year\'s Eve, as threats about Jan. 6 continued to increase.\n\n“We have an urgent need for the DataMinr replacement to be on and active starting on January 4th in support of some potential issues in the D.C. area,” the analyst wrote in a Dec. 31, 2020, email. “The sudden discontinuation is most untimely as much of our crisis response funnels through DataMinr.”\n\nBowdich, in his interview with Jan. 6 investigators, said there was a lot happening at the bureau in the days before the attack: There had been a major cyber intrusion; a bomb had gone off in downtown Nashville, Tenn.; the first anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani was approaching; and the bureau was receiving a lot of intelligence about the potential for violence, much of which was publicly available on social media.\n\n“I wish you could see the volume,” Bowdich told the committee, referring to the number of threats the FBI reviews. “It is off the charts. ... One of our greatest challenges is social media today.”\n\nThe bureau did make efforts to try to disrupt extremists\' travel to D.C.; the FBI\'s Domestic Terrorism Operations Section messaged all domestic terrorism assistant special agents in charge across the country to determine whether any of the extremists they were watching were planning to go to D.C. on Jan. 6.\n\nUltimately, the FBI set up a national command post for the event inside the Strategic Information Operations Center at FBI headquarters in Washington.\n\n“The noise seemed to be growing as we got closer to the event, and it reached a point of we just didn’t know what was going to happen,"" Bowdich said. ""Sometimes you just get a sense for it when you’ve been doing it.”\n\nSome of those officials interviewed by the committee about the intelligence failures made clear they thought there were problems that needed to be fixed, both before Jan. 6 and going forward.\n\n“[Y]ou don’t need intelligence. I mean, everybody knew that people were directed to come there by the President. November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, who was head of the D.C. National Guard on Jan. 6. The information publicly available made clear that Jan. 6 “was going to be a big deal,” he said.\n\nSund, the former Capitol Police chief who resigned the day after the attack, said that intelligence he received didn\'t ""send up a bunch of red flags for me"" because most protests target Congress. Harvin, the former chief of homeland security and intelligence for D.C., told the committee that Sund shouldn\'t characterize what happened as an intelligence failure, but as a failure to act on intelligence.\n\n“He said it was intelligence failure,"" Harvin said. ""It may have been an intelligence failure on his agency’s part and a failure to properly contextualize and pervade the threat environment, but it wasn’t an intelligence failure at large.”\n\nContee, the D.C. police chief, said there needed to be better sharing of intelligence, and that he would have liked to have known about a Capitol Police report about some of the threats related to Jan. 6.\n\n“I don’t think I want to get notified about Armageddon through an email,"" Contee said. ""That would not be my preferred notification, right?”\n\nWhen asked about what she thought the intelligence failures were, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was blunt.\n\n""People didn\'t think that these white nationalists would overthrow the Capitol building,"" the Democratic mayor said.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosi-capitol-police-congressional-security-detail-coverage-2022-10', 'Headline': 'Pelosi Attack: What We Know About Congressional Security Details ...', 'Snippet': 'Warren Rojas.

Hatch aides added that his 23-person security detail ""is the second largest on the Hill following Speaker Ryan.""\n\nWhich, extrapolated out, would mean Pelosi\'s protective force is likely to be even higher today, particularly since she was personally targeted by MAGA supporters during the January 6 attack.\n\nStaff for then-Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn confirmed in that same Roll Call story that the Texas Republican had a five-person security detail in 2017. Similar media reports say that full-time congressional security details are limited to the speaker, House and Senate majority and minority leaders, and House and Senate whips.\n\nHeightened security concerns abound\n\nAxios reported earlier this year on the hundreds of thousands in campaign funds lawmakers spent on personal security in 2021 as threats to lawmakers rise.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia led the pack of security-seeking officials with more than $600,000 in payments. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas followed with more than $360,000 in private security costs.\n\nAcross the Capitol, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York reported spending more than $83,000 on private security. Last month she told The New York Times that she\'d spent more than $120,000 on private security over the past year. And that\'s on top of the added security US Capitol Police afforded her because of all the threats her staff fields on a day-to-day basis.\n\nParty leaders reportedly told Ocasio-Cortez that she\'s one of the most threatened lawmakers in Congress, alongside Pelosi and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.\n\nFinancial records filed by the Nancy Pelosi Victory Fund PAC show that the fundraising committee paid nearly $4,000 to private security firm Safehouse Security Solutions this spring.\n\nPelosi\'s office did not respond to requests for comment about any outside security arrangements the speaker has used in the past or might be employing right now.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/01/05/1069977469/a-timeline-of-how-the-jan-6-attack-unfolded-including-who-said-what-and-when', 'Headline': 'A timeline of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack - NPR', 'Snippet': ""January 6, 2021, was a Wednesday.

A joint session of Congress was set to convene in the U.S. Capitol to certify Joe Biden\'s electoral vote win. Meanwhile, thousands of Donald Trump supporters gathered near the White House to hear him speak at noon ET.\n\nTensions were high on Capitol Hill. Protesters swarmed lawmakers outside.\n\nSen. Todd Young, R-Ind., was exasperated as protesters surrounded him on the steps of the Russell Senate Office Building at around 11:30 a.m.\n\n""When it comes to the law, our opinions don\'t matter. The law matters ... I value your opinion ... I share your conviction that President Trump should remain president. I share that conviction. But the law matters. I took an oath. I took an oath under God. Under God. Do we still take that seriously in this country?"" he said, emphatically waving his arms in the air.\n\nThree years later, and as we begin an election year where Trump is the clear frontrunner for Republican nomination, we revisit the events of that day — and exactly what happened when. Here\'s how it unfolded.\n\n12 p.m.\n\nAt noon, Trump begins speaking to his supporters at a rally near the White House.\n\n""We will never give up. We will never concede,"" Trump tells the cheering crowd.\n\nHe calls on Vice President Mike Pence — as the president of the Senate — to reject Biden\'s win and send the votes back to the states.\n\n""Mike Pence, I hope you\'re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country,"" Trump says. ""And if you\'re not, I\'m going to be very disappointed in you.""\n\nMeanwhile, Trump supporters head to both the Arkansas and Idaho state capitol buildings.\n\nAnd even before Trump ends his speech, crowds from his rally start to gather outside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAt about the same time, Pence releases a letter, calling his role in the certification of the electoral votes ""largely ceremonial,"" essentially saying he will not act as Trump has asked.\n\n""My oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,"" Pence writes.\n\n1 p.m.\n\nAn initial wave of protesters storms the outer police barrier around the Capitol.\n\n1:05 p.m.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi bangs the gavel to call the joint session of Congress to order.\n\nShortly after that, Trump ends his speech.\n\n""We\'re going to the Capitol,"" he says. ""We\'re going to try and give them [Republicans] the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.""\n\nTrump returns to the White House. He does not go to the Capitol.\n\nAbout two minutes later, in the House chambers, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., rises to question the election results from his state.\n\n""I rise for myself and 60 of my colleagues to object to the counting of the electoral ballots of Arizona,"" Gosar declares.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, joins in Gosar\'s objection.\n\nThe House and Senate split to deliberate the objection in separate parts of the Capitol building.\n\nAt the same time, in Michigan, hundreds rally in front of the state capitol, which protesters stormed less than a year earlier to decry pandemic restrictions.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., a large portion of the crowd at Trump\'s speech marches toward the Capitol, shouting, ""USA, USA, USA!""\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nOn the steps on the backside of the Capitol, protesters overcome the police, who run back into the building. Protesters watching from the sidelines cheer as a mob breaks through the final police barricades.\n\nInside the building, both the House and Senate proceed, with lawmakers seemingly unaware of the mayhem outside.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell takes the Senate floor.\n\n""Voters, the courts and the states have all spoken — they\'ve all spoken,"" he says. ""If we overrule them, it would damage our republic forever.""\n\nAround this same time, suspicious packages are found at the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., and nearby buildings are evacuated. The packages are later confirmed to be pipe bombs.\n\nShortly after 2 p.m.\n\nProtesters break windows and climb into the Capitol. They open doors for others to follow.\n\nSecret Service agents whisk Pence off the Senate floor.\n\nA few minutes later, Pelosi is ushered off the House floor.\n\n2:20 p.m.\n\nThe Senate is called to recess, and the House is called to recess shortly after.\n\nThe building goes into lockdown.\n\nAround this same time, Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman saves the Senate from a very close call, waving Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, to safety and then diverting protesters who were steps from the Senate chamber.\n\n2:24 p.m.\n\nTrump tweets: ""Mike Pence didn\'t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.""\n\nHe continues with more baseless claims about a fraudulent election.\n\n2:38 p.m.\n\nTrump tweets again, calling for support of the Capitol Police and law enforcement. He urges people to ""stay peaceful.""\n\nBut at that moment, inside the Capitol, the riot continues to unfold.\n\nRep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., tweets a video from where he\'s sheltering in the House chamber. ""We were just told that there has been tear gas in the rotunda, and we\'re being instructed to each of us get gas masks that are under our seats,"" he says.\n\nElsewhere in the country, protesters gather — at the Louisiana and Florida state capitols and the Ohio Statehouse. Several other state capitols are evacuated as a precaution.\n\nShortly before 3 p.m.\n\nRioters break into the Senate chamber. Many jump from the balcony to the floor below. They climb onto the podium and take photos and selfies, and they rifle through papers lawmakers left behind.\n\nMany also march through the halls of the Capitol. They bang on doors, destroy property and eventually break into lawmakers\' offices — most notably, that of Pelosi.\n\n3:11 p.m.\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., tweets a video while sheltering in his office, saying that this was the cost of telling people they could overturn the election.\n\n""Mr. President, you have got to stop this. You are the only person who can call this off. Call it off,"" Gallagher implores. ""The election is over. Call it off.""\n\nAround the same time, a swarm of rioters chanting, ""Break it down! Break it down!"" overwhelms Capitol Police officers guarding the Speaker\'s Lobby, where lawmakers are sheltered.\n\nThey break windows and try to force their way in.\n\nA Capitol Police officer shoots Ashli Babbitt as she tries to climb through the doors. She later dies of her injuries.\n\nSimultaneously, Trump tweets again, asking everyone to remain peaceful. Notably, he does not recant any of his claims about election fraud.\n\n3:36 p.m.\n\nMore than two hours after protesters first breached the Capitol grounds, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweets that Trump has ordered the National Guard to the Capitol.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump supporters begin to gather in Sacramento, Calif.; Austin, Texas; Denver and Minneapolis. Denver closes its city offices early, as does the Texas Capitol.\n\nShortly after 4 p.m.\n\nBiden addresses the nation.\n\n""I call on President Trump to go on national television now, to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege. This is not a protest — it is an insurrection,"" Biden says.\n\n4:17 p.m.\n\nTrump does not go on TV. Instead, he tweets a video talking to his supporters inside the Capitol.\n\n""I know your pain. I know your hurt,"" he begins. ""We love you. You\'re very special. You\'ve seen what happens. You\'ve seen the way others are treated. ... I know how you feel, but go home, and go home in peace.""\n\nAround the same time, Maryland and Virginia send National Guard and state troopers to the District of Columbia.\n\nIn the next hour, protesters in Arizona pound on the state capitol doors and break a window. A demonstration in Salem, Ore., turns violent.\n\nShortly before 6 p.m.\n\nAlmost five hours after the rioting began, police start to clear the Capitol and eventually secure the interior.\n\n6 p.m.\n\nMuriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, D.C., places the city under a 12-hour curfew.\n\n6:01 p.m.\n\nTrump tweets again.\n\n""These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!""\n\n7 p.m.\n\nFacebook removes Trump\'s video and one other post from the day. In a statement, the company says, ""We removed from Facebook and Instagram the recent video of President Trump speaking about the protests and his subsequent post about the election results. We made the decision that on balance these posts contribute to, rather than diminish, the risk of ongoing violence.""\n\nFacebook then bans Trump for 24 hours. He is currently under a two-year ban.\n\n7:02 p.m.\n\nTwitter removes Trump\'s tweets from the day and shuts down his account for 12 hours. His account is later suspended permanently.\n\n7:54 p.m.\n\nThe Republican National Committee condemns the day\'s violence.\n\nJust after 8 p.m.\n\nPence reopens the Senate.\n\n""Today was a dark day in the history of the United States Capitol. ... Let\'s get back to work,"" he says to applause.\n\nAnd McConnell makes a statement.\n\n""The United States Senate will not be intimidated,"" he says. ""We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.""\n\nThe debate over Arizona\'s ballots continues, more than six hours after it began.\n\nAround 9 p.m.\n\nPelosi brings the House back into session.\n\n""We always knew this would take well into the night, and we will stay as long as it takes. Our purpose will be accomplished,"" she says.\n\n9:53 p.m.\n\nIn a blazing speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says, ""Count me out. Enough is enough."" Graham says he hates to see his journey with Trump end this way.\n\n11:32 p.m.\n\nThe House and Senate come back together to resume the joint session, and the vote that began some 10 hours earlier continues.\n\n3:42 a.m., Jan. 7\n\nPence calls a majority of the Electoral College votes for Biden.\n\n""The announcement of the state of the vote by the president of the Senate shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice president of the United States,"" Pence says, and officially affirms the election results certifying Biden as the 46th president.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/jan-6-committee-hearing-trump-today/card/pelosi-on-mob-can-you-believe-this--QpJXhGwupo6HopQDbK7c', 'Headline': ""Pelosi on Jan. 6 Mob: 'Do You Believe This?' - The Wall Street Journal"", 'Snippet': 'Video and audio evidence revealed the frantic and alarmed reaction to the assault by congressional leaders and their efforts to restore order.

Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them.

He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/politics/biden-signs-gun-bill/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden signs bipartisan gun safety bill into law: ‘God willing, it’s ...', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious policy issues in Washington.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he finished signing the bill.\n\nThe legislation came together in the aftermath of recent mass shootings at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school and a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met.

James Comer, R-Ky., chair of the House Oversight Committee, which has been investigating Biden family business dealings. The most recent memo, from Aug. 9, said the House Oversight Committee had ""identified over $20 million from foreign sources that benefitted the Biden family and their business associates.""\n\nPolitiFact analyzed this memo, along with two previously released memos.\n\nTogether, the convoluted, sometimes repetitive, maze of financial records largely supports McCarthy’s carefully phrased claim that ""$20 million in payments were directed to the Biden family members and associates."" But his word choice as he announced an impeachment inquiry into the president could give the impression that Biden family members, or even Joe Biden himself, received an equal share of the financial gains. That’s not what bank records PolitiFact has reviewed show.\n\nThe lion’s share of the $20 million went to Biden family business associates; about $5 million went to Biden family members. The records show no evidence that any payments went to Joe Biden, who was vice president when some of the payments occurred. The records also do not reveal that Joe Biden engaged in wrongdoing.\n\nMcCarthy did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.\n\nA tale of three memos: Majority of foreign payments went to Biden family ‘associates’\n\nFinancial records made public between March 16 and Aug. 9 show details of an intricate web of about $19.3 million in payments from foreign sources that were directed to the Bidens’ associates and at least three Biden family members.\n\nThe memos that detail these payments don’t provide evidence that Joe Biden took any official actions because of his family’s business dealings.\n\nThe memos show that about $14.4 million in payments were made to ""associates"" of the Biden family or accounts associated with those individuals. These payments went largely to Hunter Biden business partners: Devon Archer, James Gilliar, Vuk Jeremić and John Robinson Walker.\n\nOther Republicans have echoed this talking point, without McCarthy’s careful phrasing. On Sept. 17, former Vice President Mike Pence, who\'s running for the Republican presidential nomination, told Fox News that when Joe Biden was vice president, his ""family accepted some $20 million, which is a hard fact.""\n\nThese payments to associates originated from companies including Burisma, Bladon Enterprises, State Energy HK and, in one instance, from Yelena Baturina, a wealthy Russian whose name has also been spelled ""Elena.""\n\nBaturina wired $3.5 million to a bank account linked to Hunter Biden and Archer, according to the memos. Republicans alleged some of this money went directly to Hunter Biden, but Archer testified the money was for an unrelated real estate transaction and did not go directly to Hunter Biden. Given this information, we counted it as a payment to an associate; we will update if more evidence comes to light.\n\nDevon Archer, Hunter Biden\'s former business partner, arrives on Capitol Hill July 31, 2023, to give closed-door testimony to the House Oversight Committee. (AP)\n\nAbout $5 million in payments went to Biden family members\n\nFrom 2014 to 2020, Biden family members received about $4.94 million from sources with ties to Ukraine, Romania, China and Kazakhstan. The memos show these payments went to:\n\nHunter Biden, the president’s son;\n\nJames Biden, the president’s brother;\n\nHallie Biden, the wife of Joe Biden’s late son Beau, who also had a relationship with Hunter after Beau’s passing;\n\nAnd an unknown account the memo characterized as a ""Biden"" account without explanation.\n\nIn many instances, payments to Biden family members were sent by wire to Robinson Walker LLC, a company owned by an associate of Hunter Biden, before they were sent to Biden family accounts.\n\nBy PolitFact’s count, about 89% of the money Biden family members received in payments — approximately $4.4 million — went to Hunter Biden or his businesses.\n\nOf the $4.4 million, Hunter Biden and companies he was linked to received:\n\n$2.6 million for his work on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nAbout $949,000 that originated from Bladon Enterprises, a company linked to Gabriel Popoviciu, according to the memos. Popoviciu is a Romanian businessman who was convicted in Romania on criminal corruption charges.\n\n$700,000 that originated from State Energy HK Ltd. and CEFC Infrastructure, two Chinese companies.\n\nAnd $142,300 that came from Kazakhstani millionaire Kenes Rakishev\'s Singapore-based company, and was used to buy Hunter Biden a sports car.\n\nA company linked to James Biden received more than $350,000 that originated with State Energy HK. Hallie Biden received two payments totaling $35,000, which the memos said originated from State Energy HK and Bladon Enterprises.\n\nSeveral payments totaling $150,000 went to the unspecified ""Biden"" account. The memos said that money originated with State Energy HK and Bladon Enterprises.\n\nFor more than four years, Republicans have been investigating the Biden family’s financial links to foreign nationals and foreign governments. Shortly after learning they had won a narrow majority in the House in the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee announced that investigating the president and his family’s business deals would be a top priority.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Ian Sams said on X, formerly Twitter, that Republicans have ""turned up no evidence of wrongdoing"" after investigating President Biden for nine months.\n\nHunter Biden remains under federal investigation for his taxes. On Sept. 14, he was indicted on one count of possession of a firearm he obtained after lying about his drug use and two counts of making false statements about his illegal drug use on a form when buying the gun.\n\nHunter Biden speaks to guests during the White House Easter Egg Roll on April 18, 2022, in Washington. (AP)\n\nWhat is a shell company?\n\nMcCarthy described the payments to Biden associates and family members as having flowed through ""shell companies.""\n\nA shell company is ""a corporate entity set-up that generally has no business operations,"" said David P. Weber, a professor in the accounting and legal studies department at Salisbury University\'s Perdue School of Business. Weber previously served as chief investigator for the Securities and Exchange Commission and as special counsel for enforcement with the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nGenerally speaking, Weber said, ""shell companies are entities formed in a jurisdiction that requires minimal documentation over who the beneficial owner is, have no active business operations or employees, and are formed for secrecy or privacy purposes.""\n\nIn the popular understanding, shell companies usually have a negative connotation, often for good reasons, experts say.\n\nSometimes, shell companies can be created for legitimate purposes, experts said. For instance, they can keep income streams separate if they are to be taxed or regulated in separate jurisdictions, said Daniel Shaviro, a taxation professor at New York University Law School. Weber said he’s seen examples in which gay couples have used shell companies to hide the joint ownership of homes in countries where LGBTQ+ couples are persecuted.\n\nMore often, though, a true ""shell company"" is a red flag for financial investigators, experts said.\n\n""Most shell companies are formed for illegitimate purposes, such as tax evasion, money laundering, other illegal activities,"" Weber said.\n\nIt’s not clear whether companies in the Hunter Biden case qualify as shell companies.\n\nIn analyzing the 21 companies cited in a GOP memo that were founded by, in partnership with, or linked to Hunter Biden, the Washington Post Fact Checker concluded that ""virtually all of the companies (many of which now are defunct) had legitimate business interests. Others had clearly identified business investments.""\n\nFor instance, the Fact Checker found entities such as separate companies founded by Hunter Biden that handled legal and lobbying work, the latter of which was disclosed as required under federal law. Rosemont Seneca Partners and several offshoots were vehicles for investments Biden and his associates made in technology, energy and entertainment ventures.\n\nA Republican memo described the Center for International Relations and Sustainable Development — a Biden family associate’s account, which received $3 million from the Chinese company State Energy HK — as ""a public policy think tank registered in Belgrade and New York.""\n\nTwo entities, Hudson West III and Hudson West IV, had an energy investment deal with CEFC China Energy. Comer has criticized this effort as ""a scheme to try to get China to buy liquefied natural gas,"" which could be viewed as a tacit acknowledgement that the companies were engaged in actual business pursuits rather than serving as shell companies.\n\n""A company that has legitimate business interests or operations is not generally considered a shell company,"" Weber said. ""It would be considered a real, operating business. Active, operating businesses with employees, physical location, or business interests"" would generally not ""fall into the definition of a shell company.""\n\nThis explains the term’s potency: It includes a clear suggestion of shadiness. But Shaviro said that if the companies do have legitimate business interests and investments, then the Republicans’ use of the term ""shell companies"" is ""inaccurate"" and ""contrary to its generally accepted meaning.""\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcCarthy said ""bank records show that nearly $20 million in payments were directed to the Biden family members and associates through various shell companies.""\n\nFinancial records released by House Republicans show a little less than $20 million in payments, but $14 million went to associates, while $5 million went to Biden family members, including Hunter.\n\nHowever, McCarthy was citing the $20 million in payments in support of an impeachment inquiry of Joe Biden, and the bank records contain neither evidence that foreign payments went to Joe Biden himself, nor evidence of wrongdoing by the president.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s not clear that the phrase ""shell companies,"" which connotes illegitimate purposes, accurately describes the corporate entities through which the money flowed. Many of the companies in question appear to have had tangible business and investment purposes, which would not fit the commonly used definition of shell companies.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.\n\nPolitiFact staff writers Jeff Cercone and Amy Sherman contributed to this report.\n\nRELATED: House Speaker Kevin McCarthy orders impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden: What to know'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6165531/why-gun-violence-groups-arent-giving-joe-biden-the-benefit-of-the-doubt-any-more/', 'Headline': 'Why Gun-Violence Groups Are Losing Patience With Joe Biden - TIME', 'Snippet': 'To be sure, Biden alone can’t fix the scourge of gun violence in this country, where privately owned guns outnumber people.

Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nFor the first few years of Barack Obama’s presidency, the White House persuaded immigration activists to hold their fire. The incoming Obama team had to first rebuild the economy and make sure Detroit’s automakers didn’t shutter after the 2008 financial meltdown. Then came a massive healthcare reboot. Then Supreme Court nominations, a Republican takeover of Congress, and the President’s own re-election.\n\nAnd then. And then. And then. There always seemed to be something keeping immigration from the frontburner. By 2014, long-simmering frustrations among immigration-rights advocates were ready to boil over and at the annual opening gala of the National Council on La Raza, as the umbrella group of advocacy and social services group now known as UnidosUS was called at the time, Obama himself was targeted for blame. “Deporter in chief” burned, especially coming from the head of one of the largest Latino organizations in the country whose alumni had embedded throughout the Obama Administration.\n\nIt clearly hurt the President, who had won re-election in 2012 with the backing of 71% of the Hispanic vote despite activists’ already deep frustrations with his first-term inaction. Two days after the gala, Obama took up his own defense: “I think the community understands I got their back and I’m fighting for them.” And a few months later, Obama rolled out expanded executive actions that—had the Supreme Court not curbed his powers—would have expanded protections to almost 5 million undocumented immigrants. During his last year in office, deportations fell to the lowest levels since 2007.\n\nBut the bell had been rung. Distrust was an open characteristic of the White House’s relationships with immigration groups from that point on. Protests flared as Obama still oversaw close to 3 million deportations over eight years. And while his efforts to patch the immigration system helped in the short term, they didn’t all last. And Donald Trump had made anti-illegal immigration a plank of his identity quickly went about dismantling protections.\n\nSo why does this history matter in Washington right now? To channel former President George W. Bush’s mangled deployment of a cliché: “Fool me once, shame on—shame on you. Fool me—you can’t get fooled again!'” As gun-violence-prevention groups work to build support for moves to reduce deaths, they’re also studying what happens when allies give an Administration a pass, especially when a political majority has every chance to flip Congress into Republicans’ hands after November’s elections. And they don’t like the historical precedent of deferring to the White House, especially one whose power may have an expiration date.\n\n“He’s a friend to the movement, sure. We can call him that. But he’s not a leader, and that’s what we really need,” says Zeenat Yahya of March For Our Lives, the youth movement that emerged in the wake of the 2017 high school shooting in Parkland, Fla.\n\nMarch For Our Lives and Guns Down America on Friday published Biden’s report card on gun violence, and the grade is a D+. The timing is matched to the one-year anniversary of Biden standing in the Rose Garden with an agenda to curb mass shootings with little to show. “The reality is: a year later that commitment has proven to be false,” says Igor Volsky, the co-founder and executive director of Guns Down America.\n\nIn conversations with leaders of the groups, it’s clear this isn’t the verdict they wanted to deliver. Neither group is explicitly political, but there is a non-zero chance that almost everyone involved in official and unofficial roles with them voted for Biden, who ran an aggressive campaign messaging against gun violence. For good reason, they thought Biden—who managed mass shooting response and outreach for Obama as the consoler-in-chief—was their guy.\n\nBut as the history of immigration reform shows, an affinity for a politician is no substitute for action. No one flinched when MoveOn protested the Bush Administration. But the political world noticed when the then-obscure network of super-rich libertarians and conservatives turned the keys on a political machine that would come to be short-handed as The Koch Brothers. The Obama White House noticed when its allies in immigrant-rights circles started showing up at the gates with protests. For all of the powers of the presidency, the ability to form effective coalitions is one of the underrated ones, and at the moment one that is proving a challenge for Biden.\n\nTo be sure, Biden alone can’t fix the scourge of gun violence in this country, where privately owned guns outnumber people. But just last weekend the latest mass shooting left six dead in Sacramento, and the White House dutifully put out a statement offering thoughts and prayers. There’s always the call for action, but then it falls by the wayside. Without any real accountability, politicians skate by on the bare minimum of performative signals. And the stakes are too high in the estimation of these activists.\n\nThere was a time not that long ago when a signal from the White House to shutdown criticism was sufficient. President Bill Clinton presided over both Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell and the Defense of Marriage Act—now widely seen as major setbacks for LGBTQ rights—yet was still welcomed in 1997 as the first sitting commander-in-chief to speak to the Human Rights Campaign’s annual gala. The White House was still seen as the political power center of Washington and actors in this space had deference to those established poles. Proximity means power, and only friends get invited to the table.\n\nBut things change. The Forever Wars, the economic crisis of 2008 and the last few years’ reckoning on gender, race and policing have left Americans rightly sour on trusting those with power. In fact, Gallup has been quantifying the shift since 1993 and the results should frighten anyone looking for public confidence as a source of authority. Public confidence in the presidency itself hit a high of 58% in June of 2002, as the Bush Administration was leading a seemingly successful disposal of the Taliban in Afghanistan but still hadn’t expanded the Global War on Terror into Iraq. That number plummeted to 26% in June of 2008 and remained parked at 38% as of June last year. In other words, it’s easy to ignore the call coming from a number that begins (202) 456-xxxx when so few people are heeding the words being dispatched from the West Wing.\n\nAs gun-violence-prevention groups look to keep Biden moving in the right direction, their public break with the White House certainly comes with risks. While no one would directly criticize the players nominally running the policy review, they know their open critique will win them few friends. But like any maturing movement, gun-violence-prevention activists are starting to have their confident years. They aren’t asking for permission the way they used to, and deference is less attractive than before. They have mailing lists and text-messaging databases that can rival most national political groups, and they’re built from grassroots followers who will do far more than write checks or retweet a meme.\n\nAnd if the Biden White House doesn’t get that, they should. After all, it wasn’t that long ago that some current Administration officials were holding signs just outside the White House gates to protest Obama’s immigration policies.""}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/21/politics/fact-check-biden-guns-africa/index.html', 'Headline': 'Fact check: Biden makes 5 false claims about guns, plus some about ...', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden made false claims about a variety of topics, notably including gun policy, during a series of official speeches and campaign remarks over the last two weeks.', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden made false claims about a variety of topics, notably including gun policy, during a series of official speeches and campaign remarks over the last two weeks.\n\nHe made at least five false claims related to guns, a subject on which he has repeatedly been inaccurate during his presidency. He also made a false claim about the extent of his support from environmental groups. And he used incorrect figures about the population of Africa, his own travel history and how much renewable energy Texas uses.\n\nHere is a fact check of these claims, plus a fact check on a Biden exaggeration about guns. The White House declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nGuns\n\nBeau Biden and red flag laws\n\nIn a Friday speech at the National Safer Communities Summit in Connecticut, Biden spoke of how a gun control law he signed in 2022 has provided federal funding for states to expand the use of gun control tools like “red flag” laws, which allow the courts to temporarily seize the guns of people who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. After mentioning red flag laws, Biden invoked his late son Beau Biden, who served as attorney general of Delaware, and said: “As my son was the first to enforce when he was attorney general.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. Delaware did not have a red flag law when Beau Biden was state attorney general from 2007 to 2015. The legislation that created Delaware’s red flag program was named the Beau Biden Gun Violence Prevention Act, but it was passed in 2018, three years after Beau Biden died of brain cancer. (In 2013, Beau Biden had pushed for a similar bill, but it was rejected by the state Senate.) The president has previously said, correctly, that a Delaware red flag law was named after his son.\n\nDelaware was far from the first state to enact a red flag law. Connecticut passed the first such state law in the country in 1999.\n\nStabilizing braces\n\nIn the same speech, the president spoke confusingly of his administration’s effort to make it more difficult for Americans to purchase stabilizing braces, devices that are attached to the rear of pistols, most commonly AR-15-style pistols, and make it easier to fire them one-handed.\n\n“Put a pistol on a brace, and it…turns into a gun,” Biden said. “Makes them where you can have a higher-caliber weapon – a higher-caliber bullet – coming out of that gun. It’s essentially turning it into a short-barreled rifle, which has been a weapon of choice by a number of mass shooters.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claims that a stabilizing brace turns a pistol into a gun and increases the caliber of a gun or bullet are false. A pistol is, obviously, already a gun, and “a pistol brace does not have any effect on the caliber of ammunition that a gun fires or anything about the basic functioning of the gun itself,” said Stephen Gutowski, a CNN contributor who is the founder of the gun policy and politics website The Reload.\n\nBiden’s assertion that the addition of a stabilizing brace can “essentially” turn a pistol into a short-barreled rifle is subjective; it’s the same argument his administration’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has made in support of its attempt to subject the braces to new controls. The administration’s regulatory effort is being challenged in the courts by gun rights advocates.\n\nGun manufacturers and lawsuits\n\nRepeating a claim he made in his 2022 State of the Union address and on other occasions, Biden said at a campaign fundraiser in California on Monday: “The only industry in America you can’t sue is the – is the gun manufacturers.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false, as CNN and other fact-checkers have previously noted. Gun manufacturers are not entirely exempt from being sued, nor are they the only industry with some liability protections. Notably, there are significant liability protections for vaccine manufacturers and, at present, for people and entities involved in making, distributing or administering Covid-19 countermeasures such as vaccines, tests and treatments.\n\nUnder the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, gun manufacturers cannot be held liable for the use of their products in crimes. However, gun manufacturers can still be held liable for (and thus sued for) a range of things, including negligence, breach of contract regarding the purchase of a gun or certain damages from defects in the design of a gun.\n\nIn 2019, the Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit against gun manufacturer Remington Arms Co. to continue. The plaintiffs, a survivor and the families of nine other victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, wanted to hold the company – which manufactured the semi-automatic rifle that was used in the 2012 killing – partly responsible by targeting the company’s marketing practices, another area where gun manufacturers can be held liable. In 2022, those families reached a $73 million settlement with the company and its four insurers.\n\nThere are also more recent lawsuits against gun manufacturers. For example, the parents of some of the victims and survivors of the 2022 massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, have sued over the marketing practices of the company that made the gun used by the killer. Another suit, filed by the government of Buffalo, New York, in December over gun violence in the city, alleges that the actions of several gun manufacturers and distributors have endangered public health and safety. It is unclear how those lawsuits will fare in the courts.\n\n– Holmes Lybrand contributed to this item.\n\nThe NRA and lawsuits\n\nAt a campaign fundraiser in California on Tuesday, Biden said the National Rifle Association, the prominent gun rights advocacy organization, itself cannot be sued.\n\n“And the fact that the NRA has such overwhelming power – you know, the NRA is the only outfit in the nation that we cannot sue as an institution,” Biden said. “They got – they – before this – I became president, they passed legislation saying you can’t sue them. Imagine had that been the case with tobacco companies.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. While gun manufacturers have liability protections, no law was ever passed to forbid lawsuits against the NRA. The NRA has faced a variety of lawsuits in recent years.\n\nMachine guns\n\nAt the same Tuesday fundraiser in California, Biden said that he taught the Second Amendment in law school, “And guess what? It doesn’t say that you can own any weapon you want. It says there are certain weapons that you just can’t own.” One example Biden cited was this: “You can’t own a machine gun.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. The Second Amendment does not explicitly say people cannot own certain weapons – and the courts have not interpreted it to forbid machine guns. In fact, with some exceptions, people in more than two-thirds of states are allowed to own and buy fully automatic machine guns as long as those guns were legally registered and possessed prior to May 19, 1986, the day President Ronald Reagan signed a major gun law. There were more than 700,000 legally registered machine guns in the US as of May 2021, according to official federal data.\n\nFederal law imposes significant national restrictions on machine gun purchases, and the fact that there is a limited pool of pre-May 19, 1986 machine guns means that buying these guns tends to be expensive – regularly into the tens of thousands of dollars. But for Americans in most of the country, Biden’s claim that you simply “can’t” own a machine gun, period, is not true.\n\n“It’s not easy to obtain a fully automatic machine gun today, I don’t want to give that impression – but it is certainly legal. And it’s always been legal,” Gutowski said in March, when Biden previously made this claim about machine guns.\n\nCalifornia, where Biden made this remark on Tuesday, has strict laws restricting machine guns, but there is a legal process even there to apply for a state permit to possess one.\n\nThe ‘boyfriend loophole’\n\nIn the Friday speech to the National Safer Communities Summit, Biden said “we fought like hell to close the so-called boyfriend loophole” that had allowed people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence to buy and possess guns if the victim was not someone they were married to, living with or had a child with. Biden then said that now “we finally can say that those convicted of domestic violence abuse against their girlfriend or boyfriend cannot buy a firearm, period.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s categorical claim that such offenders now “cannot buy a firearm, period” is an exaggeration, though Biden did sign a law in 2022 that made significant progress in closing the “boyfriend loophole.” That 2022 law added “dating” partners to the list of misdemeanor domestic violence offenders who are generally prohibited from gun purchases – but in a concession demanded by Republicans, the law says these offenders can buy a gun five years after their first conviction or completion of their sentence, whichever comes later, if they do not reoffend in the interim.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the law’s new restriction on dating partners applies only to people who committed the domestic violence against a someone with whom they were in or “recently” had been in a “continuing” and “serious” romantic or intimate relationship. In other words, it omits people whose offense was against partners from their past or someone they dated casually.\n\nMarium Durrani, vice president of policy at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said there are “definitely some gaps” in the law, “so it’s not a blanket end-all be-all,” but she said it is “really a step in the right direction.”\n\nBiden’s endorsements from environmental organizations\n\nBiden said at a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Saturday: “Let me just say one thing very seriously. You know, I think this is the first time – and I’ve been around, as I said, a while – in history where, last week, every single environmental organization endorsed me.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that every single environmental organization had endorsed Biden. Four major environmental organizations did endorse him the week prior, the first time they had issued a joint endorsement, but other well-known environmental organizations have not yet endorsed in the presidential election.\n\nThe four groups that endorsed Biden together in mid-June were the Sierra Club, NextGen PAC, and the campaign arms of the League of Conservation Voters and the Natural Resources Defense Council. That is not a complete list of every single environmental group in the country. For example, Environmental Defense Fund, The Nature Conservancy, the National Audubon Society, Earthjustice and Greenpeace, in addition to some lesser-known groups, have not issued presidential endorsements to date.\n\nBiden’s claim of an endorsement from every environmental group comes amid frustration from some activists over his recent approvals of fossil fuel projects.\n\nThe population of Africa\n\nIn official speeches last Tuesday and last Wednesday and at a press conference the week prior, Biden claimed that Africa’s population would soon reach 1 billion. “You know, soon – soon, Africa will have 1 billion people,” he said last Wednesday.\n\nFacts First: This is false. Africa’s population exceeded 1 billion in 2009, according to United Nations figures; it is now more than 1.4 billion. Sub-Saharan Africa alone has a population of more than 1.1 billion.\n\nTexas and energy\n\nAt a campaign fundraiser in Connecticut on Friday, Biden spoke about reading recent news articles about the use of renewable energy sources in Texas. He said, “I think it’s 70% of all their energy produced by solar and wind because it is significantly cheaper. Cheaper. Cheaper.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s “70%” figure is not close to correct. The federal Energy Information Administration projected late last year that Texas would meet 37% of its electricity demand in 2023 with wind and solar power, up from 30% in 2022.\n\nTexas has indeed been a leader in renewable energy, particularly wind power, but the state is far from getting more than two-thirds of its energy from wind and solar alone. The organization that provides electricity to 90% of the state has a web page where you can see its current energy mix in real time; when we looked on Wednesday afternoon, during a heat wave, the mix included 15.8% solar, 10.2% wind and 6.6% nuclear, while 67.1% was natural gas or coal and lignite.\n\nBiden’s visits to Iraq and Afghanistan\n\nIn his Friday speech at the National Safer Communities Summit, Biden made a muddled claim about his past visits to Afghanistan and Iraq – saying that “you know, I spent a lot of time as president, and I spent 30-some times – visits – many more days in Afghanistan and Iraq.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim that he has visited Afghanistan and Iraq “30-some times” is false – the latest in a long-running series of exaggerations about his visits to the two countries. His presidential campaign said in 2019 that he made 21 visits to these countries, but he has since continued to put the figure in the 30s. And he has not visited either country “as president.”\n\nBiden’s travels with Xi Jinping\n\nAt another campaign fundraiser in California on Monday, Biden reprised a familiar claim about his travels with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who is, like him, a former vice president.\n\n“It wasn’t appropriate for Barack to be able to spend a lot of time getting to know him, so it was an assignment I was given. And I traveled 17,000 miles with him, usually one on one,” Biden said.\n\nFacts First: Biden’s “17,000 miles” claim remains false. Biden has not traveled anywhere close to 17,000 miles with Xi, though they have indeed spent lots of time together. This is one of Biden’s most common false claims as president, a figure he has repeated over and over in speeches despite numerous fact checks.\n\nWashington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler noted in 2021 that Biden and Xi often did not even travel parallel routes to their gatherings, let alone physically travel together. The only apparent way to get Biden’s mileage past 17,000, Kessler found, is to add the length of Biden’s flight journeys between Washington and Beijing, during which Xi was not with him.\n\nA White House official told CNN in early 2021 that Biden was adding up his “total travel back and forth” for meetings with Xi. But that is very different than traveling “with him” as Biden keeps saying, especially in the context of his boasts about how well he knows Xi.

Fox News host Tucker Carlson led a segment on his Aug. 4, 2022 ...', 'Full_text': 'A division of the IRS that has existed for more than a century is getting a lot of attention on social media and conservative media.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson led a segment on his Aug. 4, 2022, show by telling his audience to be worried because the government is ""treating the IRS as a military agency"" and ""stockpiling"" ammunition. He asked guest U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., ""Why would the IRS need millions of dollars worth of guns and ammo?""\n\nGaetz replied, ""Well, Joe Biden is raising taxes, disarming Americans, so of course they are arming up the IRS like they are preparing to take Fallujah.""\n\nGaetz\'s comments about Biden came after Carlson cited reports from 2018 and 2020 about IRS spending on weapons and ammunition — expenditures that happened before Biden took office. Gaetz went on to say that the IRS has also spent $731,000 this year — he didn’t say specifically on what — ""to quite literally weaponize your country against you.""\n\nIn June, Gaetz, who has co-sponsored a bill to prevent the IRS from purchasing ammunition, made a similar allegation in an interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters. Then he accused the Biden administration of suppressing access to ammunition ""for regular Americans"" while ""scooping up all of the ammo they can possibly find."" In that interview, he said the IRS spent $725,000 this year on ammunition. He also cited that figure in a June press release about his bill.\n\nA spokesperson for Gaetz did not return a request for comment regarding the grounds for his claim.\n\nHere’s what we know: The IRS did spend about $725,000 on ammunition this year. But that is not unusual, and is actually a bit less than what was spent in other recent years. These purchases are not new or unique to the Biden administration — they have been made for an IRS division that has been armed for more than a century.\n\nThe IRS buys guns and ammunition yearly for IRS Criminal Investigation, the division that has jurisdiction over federal tax crimes. The people who work there are not the typical auditors that Americans facing routine audits will encounter. The vast majority of those audits are done by mail.\n\nThe division in which agents are armed was established in 1919, when it was called the Intelligence Unit, according to the division’s 2019 report. The unit famously investigated gangster Al Capone, who was convicted on tax evasion charges. It was renamed the IRS Criminal Investigation in 1978.\n\nSpecial agents in the division investigate a number of crimes, including money laundering, cybercrime, financial fraud and narcotics-related crimes. Recently they’ve been part of a multiagency task force tracking down assets of Russian oligarchs.\n\nThe division had 2,046 special agents in 2021, a little less than the 2,159 agents it had in 2017. Those numbers haven’t changed much in five years, according to annual reports available on its website; the 2022 report has not been published.\n\nThe numbers haven’t changed much in decades. In the division’s 2017 report, then-division chief Don Fort wrote, ""We have the same number of special agents — around 2,200 — as we did 50 years ago.""\n\nSpecial agents train for weeks at the National Criminal Investigation Training Academy in Georgia, the 2021 report said. That includes firearms training and handgun qualifications for agents, which is a big reason for the large orders for ammunition.\n\nThe IRS Criminal Investigation division ordered $725,460 worth of ammunition in fiscal year 2022, according to figures provided to PolitiFact by Justin Cole, the division’s communications director. That’s slightly more than the money spent in 2021 ($655,013) and 2020 ($616,619).\n\nAccording to a 2018 report (page 75 of the PDF) to Congress by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on firearms and ammunition purchases by federal law enforcement agencies, the IRS spent about $1.1 million on ammunition in 2011 and about $1 million in 2012. From 2010 to 2017, it averaged $712,500 in ammunition spending. The report described its numbers as minimum values because agencies reported challenges compiling requested data.\n\nThe report also said the IRS had 4,461 firearms and about 5 million rounds of ammunition in stock as of November 2017. The report notes the numbers don’t include weapons or ammunition purchased for a small, separate IRS police force of fewer than a dozen officers that provides security at the Enterprise Computing Center in Martinsburg, West Virginia.\n\nThe report’s authors noted that officials at law enforcement agencies said they keep ammunition on hand to last for several months for use in training and operation, and that they order large quantities because sometimes there’s a long wait, up to a year, before the orders can be fulfilled.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office said that it does not have more recent data available.\n\nThe IRS is not the only government agency that some people may be surprised to find purchasing guns and ammunition for law enforcement officers.\n\nGaetz mentioned the Department of Agriculture, which buys weapons and ammunition for the U.S. Forest Service, and the Department of Education, which purchases them for its Office of the Inspector General. The GAO report lists several others, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAs to Gaetz’s claim that these efforts come because Biden is ""raising taxes and disarming Americans,"" there is no evidence that the IRS’ longstanding spending on weapons and ammunition is connected to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions. Biden supports a House bill to ban certain assault weapons, but that measure is not likely to pass in the Senate and, even if it did, does not amount to a plan to wholesale disarm American citizens.\n\nBiden’s plan to raise taxes targets corporations and high-earning money managers, assuming the Inflation Reduction Act passes the U.S. House. That bill may have secondary effects on average Americans that are hard to measure, experts told PolitiFact. But, even so, the routine audits the IRS performs on average Americans do not involve those armed agents who deal with criminal investigations.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGaetz claimed that the government is arming up the IRS because the president is raising taxes and disarming Americans, citing the amount of money spent on ammunition by the agency this year.\n\nBut there’s been no significant increase in spending on ammunition, and Gaetz ignores that the IRS Criminal Investigation division has existed for more than a century and that the weapons and ammunition are for those law enforcement officers. That division had fewer special agents in 2021 than it had in 2017, but the number of agents has stayed about the same for decades.\n\nThe $725,000 the division spent this year on ammunition, much of which is used for agents’ firearms training, is only slightly more than was spent in recent years and less than was spent a decade ago. There is no evidence this continued tradition of spending by the IRS has any connection to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions.\n\nWe rate this claim False.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/06/qa-on-bidens-gun-proposals/', 'Headline': ""Q&A on Biden's Gun Proposals - FactCheck.org"", 'Snippet': 'Over that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.', 'Full_text': 'In a prime-time speech to the nation, President Joe Biden spoke about gun violence and his proposals to reduce it. Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2023/presidential-candidates-2024-policies-issues/joe-biden-guns-crime/', 'Headline': 'Where Joe Biden stands on crime and guns - Washington Post', 'Snippet': 'Joe Biden supports restricting access to guns for people who may harm themselves or others, and he supports requiring expanded background checks.

Just sick,” Biden said on Thanksgiving Day. “I’m going to try to get rid of assault weapons.”\n\nAfter the mass killing last Saturday at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, he said in a statement: “When will we decide we’ve had enough? ... We need to enact an assault weapons ban to get weapons of war off America’s streets.”\n\nWhen Biden and other lawmakers talk about assault weapons, they are using an inexact term to describe a group of high-powered guns or semiautomatic long rifles, such as the AR-15, that can fire 30 rounds fast without reloading. By comparison, New York Police Department officers carry a handgun that shoots about half that much.\n\nA weapons ban is far off in a closely divided Congress. But Biden and the Democrats have become increasingly emboldened in pushing for stronger gun controls — and doing so with no clear electoral consequences.\n\nThe Democratic-led House passed legislation in July to revive a 1990s-era ban on assault weapons, with Biden’s vocal support. And the president pushed a ban nearly everywhere that he campaigned this year.\n\nIn the midterm elections, Democrats kept control of the Senate and Republicans were able to claim a House majority by a narrower margin than they had expected.\n\nThe tough talk follows passage in June of a landmark bipartisan bill on gun laws, and it reflects steady progress that gun control advocates have been making in recent years.\n\n“I think the American public has been waiting for this message,” said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been the Senate’s leading advocate for stronger gun restrictions since the massacre of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. “There has been a thirst from voters, especially swing voters, young voters, parents, to hear candidates talk about gun violence, and I think Democrats are finally sort of catching up with where the public has been.”\n\nJust over half of voters want to see nationwide gun policy made more strict, according to AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of more than 94,000 voters nationwide conducted for the Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago. About 3 in 10 want gun policy kept as is, and 14% prefer looser gun laws.\n\nThere are clear partisan divides. About 9 in 10 Democrats want stricter gun laws, compared with about 3 in 10 Republicans. About half of Republicans want gun laws left as they are, and one-quarter want to see gun laws be made less strict.\n\nOnce banned in the United States, the high-powered firearms are now the weapon of choice among young men responsible for many of the most devastating mass shootings. Congress allowed the restrictions put in place in 1994 on the manufacture and sales of the weapons to expire a decade later, unable to muster the political support to counter the powerful gun lobby and reinstate the weapons ban.\n\nWhen he was governor of Florida, current Republican Sen. Rick Scott signed gun control laws in the wake of mass shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. But he has consistently opposed weapons bans, arguing like many of his Republican colleagues that most gun owners use them lawfully.\n\n“People are doing the right thing; why would we take away their weapons?” Scott asked as the Senate was negotiating gun legislation last summer. “It doesn’t make any sense.”\n\nHe said more mental health counseling, assessments of troubled students and law enforcement on campus make more sense.\n\n“Let’s focus on things that actually would change something,” Scott said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have long called for stricter gun laws, arguing that the availability of these weapons makes people less safe and makes their jobs more dangerous.\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore, who heads the country’s third-largest police department, said it just makes sense to talk about restricting firearms when gun violence is rising nationwide, and consider what the government can do to make the streets safer. He said he is grateful Biden is bringing it up so much.\n\n“This isn’t a one-and-done,” Moore said of the shooting last weekend at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo. “These things are evolving all the time, in other cities, at any moment another incident happens. It’s crying out for the federal government, for our legislators, to go out and make this change,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, six people were shot dead at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Va. Over the last six months there has been a supermarket shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., a massacre of school children in Uvalde, Texas, and the Fourth of July parade killing of revelers in Highland Park, Ill.\n\nThe legislation that Biden signed in June will, among other things, help states put in place “red flag” laws that make it easier for authorities to take weapons from people judged to be dangerous.\n\nBut a ban was never on the table.\n\nA 60-vote threshold in the Senate means some Republicans must be on board. Most are steadfastly opposed, arguing it would be too complicated, especially as sales and varieties of firearms have proliferated. There are many more types of these high-powered guns today than in 1994, when the ban was signed into law by President Clinton.\n\n“I’d rather not try to define a whole group of guns as being no longer available to the American public,” Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said. “For those of us who have grown up with guns as part of our culture, and we use them as tools — there’s millions of us, there’s hundreds of millions of us — that use them lawfully.”\n\nIn many states where the bans have been enacted, the restrictions are being challenged in court, gaining strength from a Supreme Court ruling in June expanding gun rights.\n\n“We feel pretty confident, even despite the arguments made by the other side, that history and tradition as well as the text of the 2nd Amendment are on our side,” said David Warrington, chairman and general counsel for the National Foundation for Gun Rights.\n\nBiden was instrumental in helping secure the 1990s ban as a senator. The White House has noted statistics showing that while it was in place, mass shootings declined, and when it expired in 2004, shootings tripled.\n\nThe reality is complicated. The data on the effectiveness is mixed and there is a sense that other measures that are not as politically fraught might actually be more effective, said Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York-Cortland and author of “The Politics of Gun Control.”\n\nPolitically, the ban sparked a backlash, even though the final law was a compromise version of the initial bill, he said.\n\n“The gun community was furious,” Spitzer said.\n\nThe ban has been blamed in some circles for the Democrats losing control of Congress in 1994, though subsequent research has shown that the loss was probably more about strong, well-funded conservative candidates and district boundaries, Spitzer said.\n\nStill, after Democrat Al Gore, who supported stricter gun laws, lost the 2000 White House race to Republican George W. Bush, Democrats largely backed off the issue until the Sandy Hook shooting a decade ago. Even after that, it was not a campaign topic until the 2018 midterms.\n\nNow, gun control advocates see progress.\n\n“The fact that the American people elected a president who has long been a vocal and steadfast supporter of bold gun safety laws — and recently reelected a gun-sense majority to the Senate — says everything you need to know about how dramatically the politics on this issue have shifted,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.'}}",92.5,1

When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197824584/the-biden-administration-proposes-new-federal-standards-for-nursing-home-care', 'Headline': 'Biden New Federal Standards for Nursing Home Care : NPR', 'Snippet': ""NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, after the Biden Administration proposed a new national standard for staffing nursing homes."", 'Full_text': 'In his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden made a promise to ""protect seniors\' lives."" And he\'s following through on that promise with his latest push to ensure that nursing homes, serving 1.2 million seniors, are sufficiently staffed around the clock.\n\nOn Sept. 1, the Biden administration issued a proposal to establish comprehensive staffing requirements for nursing homes across the country. The President, alongside the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has proposed a minimum nursing staff standard for facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, more than 200,000 residents and staff in long-term care facilities have died because of COVID-19.\n\n""That\'s unacceptable,"" Xavier Becerra, the secretary of HHS, told Morning Edition.\n\nRoughly three quarters of long-term care facilities would have to hire additional staff to meet the administration\'s requirements, CMS estimates.\n\n""It\'s a big change in the sense that the industry hasn\'t had to follow particular standards,"" Becerra said. ""And it\'s been the wild, wild west when it comes to quality and accountability at nursing homes throughout the country. What we\'re simply saying is we don\'t want [the] wild, wild west when we send our loved ones.""\n\nNursing is inevitably a demanding job, and it has been widely regarded as one of the most stressful occupations, according to the journal Acta Biomedica. The profession is associated with high levels of staff turnover, absenteeism and levels of burnout.\n\nIn an attempt to improve nurse retention rates and attract more people to the industry, CMS would work with private sector partners, investing over $75 million in financial incentives, such as tuition reimbursement.\n\nJacob Conrad edited the digital version.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-steps-to-improve-quality-of-nursing-homes/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Announces New Steps to ...', 'Snippet': 'Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions to increase accountability of bad actors in the nursing home industry, improve the quality of nursing homes and make them safer.', 'Full_text': ""For far too long, nursing home residents have been victims of an industry with little accountability to keep American seniors safe and protected. COVID-19 has laid bare the challenges in America’s nursing homes, with over 200,000 residents and staff dying from COVID-19. That’s why in his State of the Union, President Biden launched an action plan to improve the safety and quality of care in the nation’s nursing homes. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions to increase accountability of bad actors in the nursing home industry, improve the quality of nursing homes and make them safer. These efforts complement the Administration’s investments in home and community-based services to prevent unnecessary nursing home admissions and help nursing home residents transition back home when possible.\n\nMore Aggressive Enforcement for the Worst-Performing Nursing Homes\n\nToday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced new actions to significantly strengthen accountability for nursing homes in the Special Focus Facilities (SFF) Program, an oversight program for the poorest performing nursing homes in the country. The SFF Program already provides more frequent inspections of these nursing homes, but more action is needed to ensure these nursing homes improve.\n\nThe SFF Program reforms announced for the first time today:\n\nIncrease penalties for nursing homes in the program that fail to improve: CMS will, effective immediately, begin using escalating penalties for violations, including considering facilities with citations for dangerous violations in two successive inspections for termination from Medicare and/or Medicaid funding.\n\nIncrease safety standards for improvement: Under today’s changes, CMS is increasing the requirements that nursing homes in the SFF Program must meet to be successful and graduate from the program. Even after a facility graduates from the program, CMS will now continue close scrutiny of the facility for at least 3 years—helping ensure these nursing homes consistently maintain compliance with safety requirements.\n\nIncrease technical assistance: CMS is also increasing its engagement with these poor-performing nursing homes, through direct and immediate outreach by CMS officials upon their selection as an SFF, to help them understand how to improve and to access support resources like CMS Quality Improvement Organizations.\n\nMore Resources to Support Good-Paying, Union Jobs in Nursing Home Care\n\nSufficient, high-quality staffing is the measure most closely linked to the quality-of-care residents receive. Creating good-paying, union jobs in the nursing home industry—and career pathways into those jobs—promotes the “double dignity” of both patients and workers. That’s why today the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the Department of Labor (“DOL”) are highlighting funds that are newly available to support pathways into good-quality nursing jobs—including for the nursing home workforce:\n\nA wide variety of workforce stakeholders can apply for $80 million in grant funding available right now: Now through January 6, nonprofit healthcare organizations, industry organizations or trade groups, labor unions, labor management organizations, education and training providers, workforce development entities, and Native American Tribal Governments can apply for the DOL’s Nursing Expansion Grant program, which will provide $80 million in grants to help address bottlenecks in training the U.S. nursing workforce and expand and diversify the pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. Specifically, these funds will help: 1) increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators, and 2) train frontline healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance along a career pathway and attain recognized postsecondary credentials, including Licensed Practical Nurses and Registered Nurses. This program will emphasize training those from historically marginalized and underrepresented populations, which helps to address the growing health equity gap in medically underserved communities.\n\nHHS is announcing $13 million in grants to expand nursing education and training: These funds made available through the Health Resources and Services Administration will help expand the number of nursing preceptors—experienced licensed clinicians who supervise nursing students during their clinical rotations. Expanding preceptors will help support the goal of nursing schools admitting more students by providing more opportunities for well-supported clinical rotations and, ultimately, career paths.\n\nHHS and DOL will provide opportunities to apply for additional federal funds to support the nursing workforce pipeline: HHS and DOL have identified hundreds of millions of dollars in funds coming online over the next year to help improve nurse staffing and workforce sustainability. The Biden-Harris Administration encourages eligible entities to braid these programs to attract and retain high-quality workers to serve in healthcare professions such as nursing aides, home health aides, and registered nurses:\n\nBy the end of this year, DOL’s Employment and Training Administration’s (ETA’s) YouthBuild will make available approximately $90 million in grant funding for eligible nonprofit organizations or consortia eligible to provide education or employment training under a Federal program, in order to provide job training and educational opportunities for at-risk youth, with over one-third of recent grantees offering healthcare-related training.\n\nOn a rolling basis, ETA’s National Dislocated Worker Grants program makes tens of millions or more in grant funding available to eligible States, outlying areas designated by the Governor, and organizations eligible for funding through the Native American Programs to develop training in entry-level nursing occupations such as Certified Nursing Assistant, Medical Assisting, and Physical Therapy. These funds help develop training after major economic dislocations, such as plant closures, mass layoffs, or higher-than-average demand for employment and training activities for dislocated members of the Armed Forces and their spouses—with approximately three-quarters of grantees connecting participants to careers in healthcare.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, ETA’s WORC Initiative Grants will make available up to $35 million in grants to eligible State Government, County Government, City or Township Government, Special District Government, Regional Organization, Independent School District, Public/State Controlled Institution of Higher Education, Private Institution of Higher Education, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Indian/Native American Tribal Governments. These grant funds enable impacted communities to develop local and regional workforce development solutions aligned with existing economic development strategies and community partnerships to promote new, sustainable job opportunities and long-term economic vitality, all to support dislocated workers, new entrants to the workforce, and incumbent workers for good jobs in high-demand occupations including behavioral health, dental health, and health IT.\n\nBuilding On Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s efforts build on the many other actions the Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to improve nursing home quality and accountability since President Biden announced the Nursing Home Reform Action Plan in the State of the Union:\n\nEstablishing minimum staffing requirements: CMS launched a public input process and research study that will inform future rulemaking on a minimum staffing requirement, and the proposed rule is on track for release by Spring 2023.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection: CMS is working with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to crack down on nursing homes that illegally hold families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nIncreasing transparency & accountability: CMS made available more data on who owns Medicare-certified nursing homes, helping empower families who are comparison shopping to understand whether a nursing home is part of a bad chain. CMS also released data publicly—for the first time—on mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, and changes of ownership for nursing homes and hospitals enrolled in Medicare.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding: CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for fiscal year (FY) 2023, including a nearly billion dollar payment increase and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program. CMS also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for nursing home residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention efforts—i.e., to tie Medicaid payments to measures of safety and quality of care.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop: CMS launched its enhanced Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System, integrating data on nursing homes’ weekend staffing rates for nurses and information on annual turnover among nurses and administrators. The updated Star Ratings increase transparency to make it easier for families to comparison shop to find the reliable, quality care their loved ones deserve.\n\nPreventing fraudsters from receiving Medicare funds: CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks to be eligible for Medicare funds, preventing abuse and Medicare fraud by nursing home owners.\n\nEnsuring pandemic preparedness: CMS updated its guidance to nursing home inspectors, including, among other things, requiring infection control specialists to be on site—not just off-site consultants as the prior Administration allowed.\n\n###\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/28/fact-sheet-protecting-seniors-and-people-with-disabilities-by-improving-safety-and-quality-of-care-in-the-nations-nursing-homes/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Protecting Seniors by Improving Safety and Quality of Care ...', 'Snippet': 'To protect residents and crack down on unsafe nursing homes, President Biden will call on Congress to provide almost $500 million to CMS, a nearly 25% increase, to support health and safety ...', 'Full_text': ""All people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and to have access to quality medical care. The President is committed to ensuring that all Americans, including older Americans and people with disabilities, live in a society that is accessible, inclusive, and equitable. To accomplish that goal, the Administration continues to be committed to home- and community-based services and ensuring that in no case should a health care facility be causing a patient harm. The President believes we must improve the quality of our nursing homes so that seniors, people with disabilities, and others living in nursing homes get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve. That’s why he is announcing a set of reforms—developed by and implemented through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—that will improve the safety and quality of nursing home care, hold nursing homes accountable for the care they provide, and make the quality of care and facility ownership more transparent so that potential residents and their loved ones can make informed decisions about care.\n\nTo do this, the reforms the President is announcing will ensure that:\n\nevery nursing home provides a sufficient number of staff who are adequately trained to provide high-quality care;\n\npoorly performing nursing homes are held accountable for improper and unsafe care and immediately improve their services or are cut off from taxpayer dollars; and\n\nthe public has better information about nursing home conditions so that they can find the best available options.\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted the tragic impact of substandard conditions at nursing homes, which are home to many of our most at-risk community members. More than 1.4 million people live in over 15,500 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes across the nation. In the past two years, more than 200,000 residents and staff in nursing homes have died from COVID-19—nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nDespite the tens of billions of federal taxpayer dollars flowing to nursing homes each year, too many continue to provide poor, sub-standard care that leads to avoidable resident harm. In fact, failure to comply with Federal guidelines at nursing homes is widespread. The Government Accountability Office found that, from 2013 to 2017, 82% of all inspected nursing homes had an infection prevention and control deficiency, including a lack of regular handwashing, that was identified through Medicare and Medicaid surveys.\n\nWithout decisive action now, these unacceptable conditions may get worse. Private equity firms have been buying up struggling nursing homes, and research shows that private equity-owned nursing homes tend to have significantly worse outcomes for residents. Private equity firms’ investment in nursing homes has ballooned from $5 billion in 2000 to more than $100 billion in 2018, with about 5% of all nursing homes now owned by private equity firms. Too often, the private equity model has put profits before people—a particularly dangerous model when it comes to the health and safety of vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities. Recent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes:\n\nA recent study found that residents in nursing homes acquired by private equity were 11.1% more likely to have a preventable emergency department visit and 8.7% more likely to experience a preventable hospitalization, when compared to residents of for-profit nursing homes not associated with private equity.\n\nOne working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities over a seventeen-year period found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. That suggests an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nAnother study found that private equity-backed nursing homes’ COVID-19 infection rate and death rate were 30% and 40% above statewide averages, respectively.\n\nResearch also suggests that, despite depriving residents of quality care, private equity-owned nursing homes actually led to an uptick in Medicare costs, too.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new steps by Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) through its Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to improve the quality and safety of nursing homes, to protect vulnerable residents and the health care heroes who care for them, and to crack down on bad actors. The Administration is committed to these urgent actions as first steps toward fulfilling a broader commitment to ensure taxpayer dollars go toward the safe, adequate, and respectful care seniors and people with disabilities deserve—not to the pockets of predatory owners and operators who seek to maximize their profits at the expense of vulnerable residents’ health and safety.\n\nEnsuring Taxpayer Dollars Support Nursing Homes That Provide Safe, Adequate, and Dignified Care\n\nCMS is launching four new initiatives to ensure that residents get the quality care they need—and that taxpayers pay for. These initiatives will help ensure adequate staffing, dignity and safety in their accommodations, and quality care.\n\nEstablish a Minimum Nursing Home Staffing Requirement. The adequacy of a nursing home’s staffing is the measure most closely linked to the quality of care residents receive. For example, a recent study of one state’s nursing facilities found that increasing registered nurse staffing by just 20 minutes per resident day was associated with 22% fewer confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-19 deaths. CMS intends to propose minimum standards for staffing adequacy that nursing homes must meet. CMS will conduct a new research study to determine the level and type of staffing needed to ensure safe and quality care and will issue proposed rules within one year. Establishing a minimum staffing level ensures that all nursing home residents are provided safe, quality care, and that workers have the support they need to provide high-quality care. Nursing homes will be held accountable if they fail to meet this standard.\n\nReduce Resident Room Crowding. Most nursing home residents prefer to have private rooms to protect their privacy and dignity, but shared rooms with one or more other residents remain the default option. These multi-occupancy rooms increase residents’ risk of contracting infectious diseases, including COVID-19. CMS will explore ways to accelerate phasing out rooms with three or more residents and to promote single-occupancy rooms.\n\nStrengthen the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Value-Based Purchasing (“VBP”) Program. The SNF-VBPprogram awards incentive funding to facilities based on quality performance. CMS has begun to measure and publish staff turnover and weekend staffing levels, metrics which closely align with the quality of care provided in a nursing home. CMS intends to propose new payment changes based on staffing adequacy, the resident experience, as well as how well facilities retain staff.\n\nReinforce Safeguards against Unnecessary Medications and Treatments. Thanks to CMS’ National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care in Nursing Homes, the nation has seen a dramatic decrease in the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes in recent years. However, inappropriate diagnoses and prescribing still occur at too many nursing homes. CMS will launch a new effort to identify problematic diagnoses and refocus efforts to continue to bring down the inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications.\n\nEnhancing Accountability and Oversight\n\nHolding nursing homes accountable for their performance requires a robust compliance program—a program that has adequate funding to perform inspections and that imposes meaningful penalties when deficiencies are found. Federal taxpayer dollars should not flow to nursing homes that are unsafe.\n\nAdequately Fund Inspection Activities. For over seven years, funding to conduct health and safety inspections has remained flat while the number of complaints about nursing homes has surged. To protect residents and crack down on unsafe nursing homes, President Biden will call on Congress to provide almost $500 million to CMS, a nearly 25% increase, to support health and safety inspections at nursing homes.\n\nBeef up Scrutiny on More of the Poorest Performers. CMS’s Special Focus Facility (SFF) program identifies the poorest-performing nursing homes in the country for increased scrutiny in an effort to immediately improve the care they deliver. The SFF program currently requires more frequent compliance surveys for program participants, which must pass two consecutive inspections to “graduate” from the program. The SFF program will be overhauled to more quickly improve care for the affected residents, including changes that will make its requirements tougher and more impactful. CMS will also make changes that allow the program to scrutinize more facilities, by moving facilities through the program more quickly. Facilities that fail to improve will face increasingly larger enforcement actions, including termination from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, when appropriate.\n\nExpand Financial Penalties and Other Enforcement Sanctions. CMS will expand the instances in which it takes enforcement actions against poor-performing facilities based on desk reviews of data submissions, which will be performed in addition to on-site inspections. In July 2021, CMS rescinded a Trump Administration change that lowered penalty amounts on bad actor nursing homes for harmful deficiencies by imposing only a one-time fine, instead of more aggressive per-day fines that charge for each day a facility is out of compliance. CMS will now explore making such per-day penalties the default penalty for non-compliance. CMS will also use data, predictive analytics, and other information processing tools to improve enforcement. President Biden is also calling on Congress to raise the dollar limit on per-instance financial penalties levied on poor-performing facilities, from $21,000 to $1,000,000.\n\nIncrease Accountability for Chain Owners of Substandard Facilities. President Biden is calling on Congress to give CMS new authority to require minimum corporate competency to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs, enabling CMS to prohibit an individual or entity from obtaining a Medicare or Medicaid provider agreement for a nursing home (new or existing) based on the Medicare compliance history of their other owned or operated facilities (previous or existing). He is further calling on Congress to expand CMS enforcement authority at the ownership level, enabling CMS to impose enforcement actions on the owners and operators of facilities even after they close a facility, as well as on owners or operators that provide persistent substandard and noncompliant care in some facilities, while still owning others.\n\nProvide Technical Assistance to Nursing Homes to Help them Improve. CMS currently contracts with Quality Improvement Organizations that help providers across the health care spectrum make meaningful quality of care improvements. CMS will ensure that improving nursing home care is a core mission for these organizations and will explore pathways to expand on-demand trainings and information sharing around best practices, while expanding individualized, evidence-based assistance related to issues exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nIncreasing Transparency\n\nFor too long, corporate owners and operators have not been held to account for poor nursing home performance. CMS will improve the public transparency of facility ownership and safeguard nursing home residents.\n\nCreate a Database of Nursing Home Owners and Operators. CMS will create a new database that will track and identify owners and operators across states to highlight previous problems with promoting resident health and safety. This registry will use information collected through provider enrollment and health and safety inspections to provide more information about prospective owners and operators to states. Giving the public a resource to better understand owners’ and operators’ previous violations will empower states to better protect the health and safety of residents.\n\nImprove Transparency of Facility Ownership and Finances. CMS will implement Affordable Care Act requirements regarding transparency in corporate ownership of nursing homes, including by collecting and publicly reporting more robust corporate ownership and operating data. It will also make this information easier to find on the Nursing Home Care Compare website.\n\nEnhance Nursing Home Care Compare: CMS will implement a range of initiatives to improve Nursing Home Care Compare, the rating website designed to help families pick a facility for their loved ones. Under the Biden-Harris Administration’s leadership, CMS has already published new measures on Care Compare, which allow users to consider nursing home staff turnover, weekend staffing levels, and other important factors in their decision-making process. When the new minimum staffing requirement comes online, Care Compare will also prominently display whether a facility is meeting these minimum staffing requirements. CMS will further improve Care Compare by improving the readability and usability of the information displayed—giving you and your family insight into how to interpret key metrics. Finally, CMS will ensure that ratings more closely reflect data that is verifiable, rather than self-reported, and will hold nursing homes accountable for providing inaccurate information. The President is calling on Congress to give CMS additional authority to validate data and take enforcement action against facilities that submit incorrect information.\n\nExamine the Role of Private Equity. As described above, private equity investors are playing a growing role in the nursing home sector, and published research increasingly indicates that facility ownership by investment groups leads to worse outcomes while costing taxpayers more—particularly as these owners have sought to cut expenses at the cost of patient health and safety, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. HHS and other federal agencies will examine the role of private equity, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and other investment ownership in the nursing home sector and inform the public when corporate entities are not serving their residents’ best interests.\n\nCreating Pathways to Good-paying Jobs with the Free and Fair Choice to Join a Union\n\nEnsure Nurse Aide Training is Affordable. Lowering financial barriers to nurse aide training and certification will strengthen and diversify the nursing home workforce. CMSwill establish new requirements to ensure nurse aide trainees are notified about their potential entitlement to training reimbursement upon employment. CMS will further work with states to ensure reimbursement is being distributed and that free training opportunities are widely publicized.\n\nSupport State Efforts to Improve Staffing and Workforce Sustainability. Strengthening the nursing home workforce requires adequate compensation as well as a realistic career ladder. CMS will develop a template to assist and encourage States requesting to tie Medicaid payments to clinical staff wages and benefits, including additional pay for experience and specialization.\n\nLaunch National Nursing Career Pathways Campaign. CMS, in collaboration with the Department of Labor, will work with external entities—including training intermediaries, registered apprenticeship programs, labor-management training programs, and labor unions—to conduct a robust nationwide campaign to recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into long-term care careers, with pathways into health-care careers like registered and licensed nurses.\n\nEnsuring Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness in Nursing Homes\n\nContinued COVID-19 Testing in Long-term Care Facilities. Throughout the pandemic, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided approximately 3 million tests per week to all Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes and thousands more assisted living facilities, supporting outbreak testing and regular testing of staff. HHS will continue to support this key mitigation strategy for vulnerable residents and the staff that care for them.\n\nContinued COVID-19 Vaccinations and Boosters in Long-term Care Facilities. The Biden-Harris Administration has provided the full support of the federal government to states in ensuring that staff and residents across long-term care facilities have access to vaccinations and booster shots. Today, facilities are required to ensure staff are vaccinated and more than 87.1% of residents have received their primary series. CDC continues to offer all facilities the ability to be matched with a federal pharmacy partner to host an on-site vaccination clinic. CMS has reached out to thousands of these facilities directly to offer support, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has made a wide set of tools available. HHS will continue to promote access to these clinics and efforts to integrate vaccinations into routine services, incentivize vaccinations through provider quality payment programs, and continue to provide a full range of resources to continue to build confidence in the vaccine.\n\nStrengthen Requirements for On-site Infection Preventionists. CMS will clarify and increase the standards for nursing homes on the level of staffing facilities need for on-site infection prevention employees, undoing the Trump Administration’s changes to these requirements to help improve resident health and safety.\n\nEnhance Requirements for Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness. Both the pandemic and the increase in natural disasters have demonstrated how critical proactive emergency preparedness is to keeping residents of nursing homes safe. CMS is examining and considering changes to emergency preparedness requirements and is working to bolster the resiliency of the health care sector as part of an Administration-wide effort to be ready for the next pandemic and the next weather-related emergencies.\n\nIntegrate Pandemic Lessons into Nursing Home Requirements. The pandemic has underscored the need for resident-centered updates to nursing homes’ requirements of participation in Medicare and Medicaid. CMS will integrate new lessons on standards of care into nursing home requirements around fire safety, infection control, and other areas, using an equity lens.\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/11/15/biden-harris-administration-continues-unprecedented-efforts-increase-transparency-nursing-home-ownership.html', 'Headline': 'Biden-Harris Administration Continues Unprecedented Efforts to Increase ...', 'Snippet': 'Final rule will require disclosure of new information to shine a light on private equity ownership.

Today’s final rule includes definitions of private equity and real estate investment trusts, setting the stage for identifying whether a nursing home belongs to one of these types of owners. These actions continue to build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s unwavering commitment to improving the safety and quality of care in the nation’s nursing homes and President Biden’s historic Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. Earlier this year, CMS and HHS also proposed a rule in September to establish national minimum staffing standards for nursing homes to enhance the quality and safety of care.\n\n“HHS continues to take action to improve the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing homes,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “The Biden-Harris Administration believes that residents living in nursing homes should receive the dignity, care, and respect they deserve. Taking steps to help consumers to learn more about the owners of a nursing home will allow them to make the choice that best meets their needs.”\n\n“CMS is committed to leveraging our tools to improve safety and quality of care in nursing homes, CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said. “By strengthening our ability to examine nursing home ownership, including private equity and real estate investment trusts, we can improve transparency for the people we serve and their loved ones, researchers, and regulators, and enable better informed decisions about nursing home care.”\n\nThe final rule requires nursing homes enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid — the majority of this country’s nursing homes — to disclose additional information regarding their owners, operators, and management; for example, nursing homes will disclose individuals or entities that provide administrative services or clinical consulting services to the nursing homes. Nursing homes will also be required to disclose entities that exercise financial control over the facility, such as an organization the nursing home hires to manage all of its financial matters.\n\nNursing homes frequently use other companies to provide major services or supports within a facility, but families currently have no way of knowing which different companies or firms provide care to their loved ones and how they might be connected to the owners of a nursing home. That will change under this rule. The final rule also requires additional information about entities that lease or sublease property to nursing homes, since the facilities and property owners may be set up as different corporate entities even though the entities work hand-in-hand.\n\nConcerns about the quality of care and operations of nursing facilities owned by private equity companies and other types of investment firms have increased since 2011, and the sector continues to attract robust sales.\n\nThe number of nursing homes sold each year has increased since 2016, generously outpacing that of hospitals. Between 2016 and 2021, 348 hospitals experienced a change in ownership, but 3,000 nursing homes experienced a change in ownership – four times more than hospitals. Nursing homes with lower Star quality ratings are sold more often than those with higher Star quality ratings, raising concerns about the relationship between ownership changes and quality.\n\nRecent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes, and in the two to three years after real estate investment trusts invest in nursing homes, registered nurse staffing levels decline by as much as 6%. Private equity ownership of nursing homes may also lead to an uptick in Medicare costs. Additionally, the 10 largest nursing home chains own more than 10% of nursing homes — a disproportionate share that raises concerns about market concentration.\n\nThe additional data required to be reported under the rule will be public, allowing families to make more informed choices about the care of their loved ones. This will also enable CMS and others to scrutinize more closely how ownership types correlate with care outcomes and to determine which environments are more likely to deliver better care for residents and patients.\n\nFor a fact sheet on the final nursing home ownership disclosure rule, visit: https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/disclosures-ownership-and-additional-disclosable-parties-information-skilled-nursing-facilities-and-0\n\nFor the ASPE report on nursing home ownership and quality trends, visit:\n\nhttps://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/nh-ownership-its-implications-quality-availability-care.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/08/15/bidens-20-million-south-carolina-retreat-plagued-by-mold-termites/', 'Headline': ""Biden's $20 million South Carolina retreat plagued by mold, termites"", 'Snippet': 'Hunter Biden has joined Joe and other family members on their trip to South Carolina last week.

They’re just friends.”\n\nThe Daily Mail reported on Monday, citing court documents, that behind its seemingly pristine façade, the nine-bedroom estate that has hosted the Bidens on and off since 2009 has become something of a money pit and the subject of several rounds of litigation.\n\nA 2019 appeals court ruling in Allwin’s lawsuit against the builders of her home described the many issues that have bedeviled the luxury property over the years, including mold and mildew, multiple cracks, peeling wallpaper and damaged drywall, leaks, warped hardwood flooring and termites.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Allwin first became aware of the problems back in 1999 — just five years after construction on her mansion was finished.\n\nA contractor that Allwin hired to assess the condition of the property told her in 2004 that the roof was “so poorly installed, the only way to properly repair the roof is to replace it” to the tune of more than $500,000, according to the document.\n\nAllwin balked at the high price tag but proceeded to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into an array of home repairs over the next several years. She ultimately sued the company that built her home, Russ Cooper Associates, in 2013, but lost at trial because she waited too long to file the complaint and the statute of limitations had run out. She appealed the ruling, but the appeals court rejected her claim on the same grounds.\n\nAllwin’s house problems did not scare away the Bidens, who stayed there in August 2009, April 2012, April 2014, June 2015 and August 2015, according to records obtained by the outlet from Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop as well as records from Biden’s time as President Barack Obama’s vice president.\n\nA rep for the Allwin family told The Post on Monday, “Any issues with the house have long been resolved.”\n\nAllwin has known Joe and Jill Biden socially for more than a decade, a source told The Post last week, adding that they do not have any joint business dealings.\n\nAhead of the 2020 election, Allwin sent a $35,000 check to the Biden Victory Fund and the Democratic National Committee, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nShe has contributed generously to a variety of mostly Democratic political campaigns, but her most recent donations were to Rep.

Over the past year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has taken historic actions to deliver on the President’s call to action and ensure seniors and people with disabilities get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve.\n\nToday, in a continued effort to deliver on the President’s commitment, HHS announced additional action to increase the transparency of nursing home ownership and management. The Department issued a proposed rule to require nursing homes to disclose to CMS and states additional ownership and management information. The rule also includes private equity and real estate investment trust definitions, setting the stage for the disclosure of whether nursing home owners are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. The proposal marks an important step in continuing to implement President Biden’s initiative to improve the quality and care available at nursing homes. By making facility ownership and oversight more transparent, nursing home residents and their families will be more empowered to make informed decisions about care.\n\n“President Biden has made clear: improving our nation’s nursing homes is an urgent priority, and this Administration is not afraid to take bold action to tackle this head-on,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “We are continuing our unprecedented efforts to increase nursing home ownership transparency – because it’s what the public deserves. We are pursuing all avenues to shine a light on this industry. We will keep doing everything we can to ensure all Americans receive the dignity, care, and respect they deserve.”\n\n“CMS is committed to using every tool at our disposal to improve nursing home care and identify trends that enhance residents’ quality of life,” CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said. “If finalized, this rule would strengthen our ability to examine ownership types, including private equity and real estate investment trusts.”\n\nThe proposed rule would implement portions of Section 6101(a) of the Affordable Care Act. This would require nursing homes enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid — the majority of this country’s nursing homes — to disclose additional information regarding owners, operators, and management; for example, nursing homes would disclose individuals or entities that provide administrative services or clinical consulting services to the nursing homes.\n\nNursing homes frequently use other companies to provide major services or support, but families currently have no way of knowing which different companies or firms provide care to their loved ones and how they might be connected to the owners of a nursing home. The proposed rule would also require additional information about entities that lease or sublease property to nursing homes, since the facilities and property owners may be set up as different corporate entities even though the entities work hand-in-hand.\n\nIn addition to the Section 6101(a) disclosures, the proposed rule would provide definitions of “private equity company” and “real estate investment trust” to assist nursing homes when reporting this data.\n\nThese key definitions will lead to the disclosure of whether direct and indirect nursing home owners are private equity companies or real estate investment trusts via an updated nursing home enrollment application expected to be ready for public use in the summer of 2023.Concerns about the quality of care and operations of nursing facilities owned by private equity companies and other types of investment firms have increased since 2011. Recent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes:\n\nA recent study found that residents in nursing homes acquired by private equity were 11.1% more likely to have a preventable emergency department visit and 8.7% more likely to experience a preventable hospitalization, when compared to residents of for-profit nursing homes not associated with private equity.\n\nOne working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities over a 17-year period found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership. Another study found that private equity-backed nursing homes had a COVID-19 infection rate and death rate that were 30% and 40% above statewide averages, respectively.\n\nResearch also suggests that private equity ownership of nursing homes may lead to an uptick in Medicare costs, too.\n\nThe additional data required to be reported under the rule would be publicly reported pursuant to section 6101(b) of the Affordable Care Act. This transparency will, among other things, allow families to make more informed choices about the care of their loved ones, and it will enable CMS and others to scrutinize more closely how ownership types correlate with care outcomes and to determine which environments are more likely to deliver better care for residents and patients.\n\nThese new data and analysis support President Joe Biden’s Executive Order on Promoting Competition, and advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of improving transparency around nursing facility ownership and improve competition of the overall industry. Greater transparency will help both the Administration and external parties better understand how the nursing home market is changing and whether the market is becoming more concentrated, which could potentially disrupt market competition and affect quality of care. For example, data analysis has shown:\n\nBetween 2016 and 2021, 348 hospitals experienced a change in ownership, but 3,000 nursing homes experienced a change in ownership. The number of nursing homes sold each year has increased since 2016.\n\nThe largest 10 nursing home chains own more than 10% of nursing homes—a disproportionate share that raises concerns about market concentration.\n\nNursing homes with lower Star quality ratings are sold more often than those with higher Star quality ratings, raising concerns about the relationship between ownership changes and quality.\n\nRecently published research has found that in the 2-3 years after real estate investment trusts invest in nursing homes, registered nurse staffing levels decline by as much as 6%.\n\nToday’s proposed rule builds on the Department’s historic releases of data and unprecedented efforts to increase transparency. In April 2022, CMS released data publicly – for the first time ever – on mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, and changes of ownership from 2016-2022 for hospitals and nursing homes enrolled in Medicare. In September 2022, CMS released additional data publicly on the ownership of approximately 15,000 nursing homes certified as a Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility, regardless of any change in ownership, including providing more information about organizational owners of nursing homes. In December 2022, CMS released ownership data publicly — for the first time ever — for all Medicare-certified hospitals.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/op-ed-the-president-nursing-homes', 'Headline': 'Op-Ed by the President on Nursing Homes', 'Snippet': ""[President Joe Biden, 9/1/23] As a country, we're delivering a clear message to the nursing home industry.

We\'re ending the abuse today.\n\n[President Joe Biden, 9/1/23]\n\nAs a country, we\'re delivering a clear message to the nursing home industry. If you tell families you\'ll take care of their loved ones, then follow through.\n\nIt\'s one of the most gut-wrenching moments American families face: when a loved one can no longer be cared for at home and needs to move into a nursing home. You lie awake at night wondering: will they receive the care and support they need? How can you be sure they\'ll be safe? Are you doing the right thing?\n\nUnfortunately, too many Americans across the country know firsthand how hard it can be to find a nursing home that provides that peace of mind. A woman in Texas, who has changed nursing facilities three times in four years over concerns about care, wrote to me, ""we keep looking for someplace that will fulfill the promises they make when you\'re admitted."" A daughter in New York, whose mother is in a facility, wrote ""it keeps me up at night, when there\'s half of what\'s needed"" to keep her mom safe.\n\nDespite nursing homes receiving nearly $100 billion annually from American taxpayers, too many facilities are understaffed, which can result in severe illness and even death for residents. Those vulnerabilities were exposed during the pandemic, when more than 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died from COVID-19. And in recent years, more private-equity firms have been buying up nursing homes and slashing key staff to cut costs and make bigger profits, endangering the safety of their residents in the process.\n\nIn my State of the Union address, I pledged to crack down on nursing homes that put the well-being of their residents at risk. Today, here\'s how my administration is following through on this commitment to ensure every nursing home is safe for every resident, and residents get the care they deserve.\n\nWe\'re proposing minimum staffing requirements for every taxpayer-funded nursing home. Under our new proposed standards, every nursing facility would have to provide a registered nurse on site 24/7 and have enough nurses and nurse aides to provide routine bedside care, among other tasks. Research shows that these staffing levels will save lives, provide residents with a higher quality of life and prevent needless suffering.\n\nThink of it this way: we are working to make sure no nursing home can sacrifice the safety of their residents just to add some dollars to their bottom line. It\'s telling that non-profit nursing homes are three times as likely as for-profit facilities to already satisfy the minimum staffing standard we\'re proposing today. Some corporate nursing home owners are taking taxpayer dollars while cutting corners on staffing so they can make big payouts to executives and shareholders. It\'s wrong.\n\nWe\'re also supporting the folks who are doing God\'s work – the nursing staff who care for so many of our loved ones, but who are over-worked and under-resourced. Nursing home staff describe getting burnt out when they have too many residents to care for in too little time. Many end up leaving the industry. Minimum staffing standards would help them stay in the jobs they love. And we\'re doing our part.\n\nToday, the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing a new $75 million investment, on top of hundreds of millions of dollars already committed, to recruit, train and retain nurses and other caregivers.\n\nThese announcements are the latest in my administration\'s effort to make nursing homes safer and to make sure taxpayer dollars are well spent. We\'ve increased transparency and accountability for nursing home owners, gone after fraud and abuse and more. We also remain focused on supporting high quality care at home. That\'s why in April, I signed an executive order to support caregivers, building on prior actions and investments in home and community-based care.\n\nAs a country, we\'re delivering a clear message to the nursing home industry: no more padding profits on the backs of residents and nurses. If you tell families you\'ll take care of their loved ones, then follow through.\n\nThat\'s how we build a long-term care system where loved ones can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive the care they need in the setting of their choice and where there is a pipeline of health care workers into good-paying jobs – that include the free and fair choice to join a union.\n\nFor all you facing that most gut-wrenching of moments, you and your loved ones deserve nothing less than peace of mind and dignity. I have your back.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2022-03-18/to-families-dismay-biden-nursing-home-reform-doesnt-view-them-as-essential', 'Headline': 'To Families’ Dismay, Biden Nursing Home Reform Doesn’t View Them as ...', 'Snippet': 'Relatives who often provide vital caregiving for nursing home residents say the lockdowns during the COVID pandemic showed the need for family members to visit in person with their loved ones.', 'Full_text': 'By Judith Graham | KHN\n\nWhen the Biden administration announced a set of proposed nursing home reforms last month, consumer advocates were both pleased and puzzled.\n\nThe reforms call for minimum staffing requirements, stronger regulatory oversight, and better public information about nursing home quality — measures advocates have promoted for years. Yet they don’t address residents’ rights to have contact with informal caregivers — family members and friends who provide both emotional support and practical assistance.\n\nREAD:\n\nSeniors Find Fortitude Waning, Malaise Growing\n\nThat’s been a painful concern during the pandemic as nursing homes have locked down, caregivers have been unable to visit loved ones, and a significant number of residents have become isolated, discouraged, or depressed.\n\nThousands of residents died alone, leaving a trail of grief for those who couldn’t be by their side. Altogether, more than 200,000 residents and staffers in long-term care facilities perished of COVID-19 in the first two years of the pandemic, according to an analysis by KFF.\n\n“What we learned is that family members’ support is absolutely essential to the well-being of residents,” said Mairead Painter, Connecticut’s long-term care ombudsman. (Ombudsmen are official advocates for nursing home residents.) “We need to make sure that the far-reaching restrictions put in place never happen again.”\n\nAlthough nursing home residents have a right to have visitors under federal law, this protection was “degraded” during the pandemic, said Tony Chicotel, a staff attorney for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. “I worry that facilities and public health departments will feel emboldened to cut visitation off at their discretion, whenever there’s an infectious disease outbreak,” he explained.\n\nWhat’s needed now, Chicotel suggested, is legislation stating that “even in a public health emergency, residents have a core right to support from [informal] caregivers that cannot be waived.”\n\nA new “essential caregivers” bill in California (AB-2546) would allow residents to designate two such informal caregivers, one of which would have access to a facility around-the-clock without advance scheduling. Caregivers would need to comply with the same safety and infection control protocols that apply to staffers. Laws with a similar intent have passed in 11 states, according to the Essential Caregivers Coalition, an advocacy group formed during the pandemic.\n\nNationally, the Essential Caregivers Act of 2021, another measure along these lines, is languishing in the House Ways and Means health subcommittee. Competing priorities, pandemic-related fatigue, and a sense that the covid emergency “is behind us” are contributing to inaction, said Maitely Weismann, a co-founder of the Essential Caregivers Coalition.\n\nIf sweeping nursing home changes don’t address the harm to residents when they are cut off from families, “we’re only halfway where we need to be,” she cautioned. The White House did not respond to requests for comment about whether it planned to address the issue.\n\nREAD:\n\nManchin Takes the Teeth Out of Democrats’ Plan for Seniors’ Dental Care\n\nElizabeth O. Stern, 69, of Stonington, Connecticut, was unable to see her 91-year-old mother for eight months after her mother’s nursing home shut its doors on March 10, 2020. Before the pandemic, Stern visited nearly every day with her mother, who had a stroke in 2016 and developed dementia.\n\n“I did her laundry and cleaned and washed the windows in her room,” Stern told me. “I took care of her fingernails and much of her personal care. I’d sing her to sleep at night.”\n\nUnable to see her family during the long pandemic-inspired lockdown, Stern’s mother became anguished, and her health deteriorated. Two and a half days before she died in November 2020, Stern was finally able to get inside the nursing home to say her final goodbyes.\n\n“So many family caregivers like me are scratching their heads and wondering why, after all the devastation we’ve suffered, are we again being overlooked in the [Biden administration’s] proposed reforms,” she said.\n\nNew research confirms the extent of assistance that family caregivers like Stern provide. Using national survey data from 2016, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania reported in a recent Health Affairs study that informal caregivers helped 91% of nursing home residents who needed aid with medications; 76% of residents who required assistance with self-care tasks such as bathing or dressing; 75% of residents who had problems such as getting in and out of bed or moving across a room; and 71% who required aid with household tasks, such as managing money. On average, this care from informal caregivers amounted to 37 hours a month.\n\nIn addition to the harmful effect on residents, the loss of this assistance during the pandemic placed extra burdens on already-stressed nursing home workers, contributing to the staffing crisis that afflicts long-term care, said Dr. Rachel Werner, co-author of the study.\n\n“The discussion we should be having is how to support [informal] caregivers in long-term care facilities, whether we’re in a pandemic or not, by acknowledging what they do, giving them more training, and making them part of care teams and the care planning process,” Werner said.\n\nMORE:\n\nSupport Service Coordinators for Older Adults\n\nRobyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, an advocacy organization, added a note of caution. “One of the things we’re concerned about is that family members and the assistance they provide might be looked at, in some cases, as part of a solution to short-staffing in nursing homes,” she told me.\n\n“Yes, family members can help, and we want to make sure that their access to long-term care facilities is ensured. But they can’t be seen as a substitute for staff.”\n\nIn San Francisco, that line blurred for Dr. Teresa Palmer, a geriatrician, whose 103-year-old mother took to bed in her nursing home in March 2021 and wouldn’t get up. Concerned, Palmer insisted on a “compassionate care” exception to the nursing home’s lockdown rules and was able to see her mother inside the facility for the first time in a year.\n\n“To the staff, my mother was just an old person who was acting old. But she was down to 90 pounds from a baseline weight of 105 and her bowel functions had changed,” said Palmer, who took her mother to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with malnourishment, dehydration, and pancreatic cancer.\n\nPalmer brought her mother home from the hospital, with hospice care, where she died 10 weeks later.\n\n“Even in a very good nursing home such as my mother’s, they really don’t have time to make sure residents are eating enough or drinking enough or give the hands-on loving care that family members provide,” Palmer said.\n\nAs for the nursing home industry, there are signs this lesson has hit home. In a statement about the national Essential Caregivers Act, the American Health Care Association said, “We applaud this bill and welcome family members and friends taking an active role in the care of their loved ones.” The statement was forwarded by Cristina Crawford, senior manager of public affairs.\n\nRuth Katz, senior vice president of public policy at Leading Age, another long-term care association, wrote in a statement that her group believes quality care “includes residents’ ability to maintain regular connections to and contact with family and friends” and expects new federal rules to reinforce caregivers’ efforts to support nursing home residents in emergencies in the future.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-escalates-fight-social-security-medicare-frustrating-republicans-rcna70104', 'Headline': 'Biden escalates fight over Social Security and Medicare, frustrating ...', 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — After President Joe Biden pummeled Republicans on Social Security and Medicare during his State of the Union address, drawing shouts of outrage from the party, Republican leaders ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — After President Joe Biden pummeled Republicans on Social Security and Medicare during his State of the Union address, drawing shouts of outrage from the party, Republican leaders urged him to stop telling Americans that the GOP wants to slash those retirement programs.\n\nThen Biden paid a visit to Florida and did it again, exasperating the party and escalating a fight that is poised to play out on Capitol Hill and in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“The president, for a few weeks now, has been falsely saying that there are people that want to get rid of Social Security and Medicare. And it’s been inaccurate for a long time — and you saw last night when he tried to pin it on us,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told NBC News one day after Biden\'s speech to Congress. “I just hope he stops going around the country telling that falsehood because there’s no truth to it.\n\n“We want to strengthen Social Security by ending a lot of those government checks to people staying at home rather than going to work,” Scalise said, endorsing work requirements for benefits.\n\nThe next day, at the University of Tampa on Thursday, Biden tore into a plan from Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., saying it would “sunset Social Security and Medicare every five years.” He also went after Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who has labeled Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and called for restructuring it.\n\n“They were offended. ‘Liar! Liar!’” Biden mimicked.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has pushed Biden to back spending cuts but said Social Security and Medicare should be exempted. There is no bill with GOP consensus to change those programs, although there are various proposals to rein them in over time. The White House has told NBC News that Biden will keep criticizing those Republican plans.\n\nBiden\'s attack stems from a policy agenda released last year by Scott, then the head of the Senate Republican campaign arm. The agenda included a section reading: “All federal legislation sunsets in 5 years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again.” Democrats immediately said such a policy, if implemented, could cause Social Security and Medicare to sunset. Republican leaders, recognizing the political dangers, have distanced themselves from it. But Biden has persisted in using that and other GOP candidates\' remarks on so-called entitlements to drive a wedge between them and voters who rely on the programs.\n\nBiden advisers also cite the 2023 budget by the Republican Study Committee, a group of more than 100 House members, that proposes to raise the eligibility age for Social Security to adjust for changing life spans, and slow the growth of benefits over time. It also includes Medicare “premium support” for private plans, mirroring a controversial idea by former Speaker Paul Ryan last decade, which became a flashpoint in the 2012 election.\n\n“Republicans don’t like being called out on this,” Biden said. “A lot of Republicans — their dream is to cut Social Security and Medicare. Well, let me say this: If that’s your dream, I’m your nightmare.”\n\nThe divide between Democrats and Republicans\n\nBiden\'s State of the Union and subsequent trips are viewed as a soft launch for his widely expected re-election bid, in which he intends to paint the GOP as a threat to Social Security and Medicare — the crown jewels of the Democratic-led New Deal and Great Society — seizing on decades of attempts to restructure, privatize or reduce long-term spending on the popular safety net programs.\n\nDemocrats seized on the issue in the 2022 midterms with some success, and now it moves to an even bigger stage.\n\n“It’s a smart play for the near term in the debt limit fight, and it’s even a smarter play when we head to the 2024 re-elect,” said Scott Mulhauser, a former top Biden aide who has worked on campaigns and in government. “It moves voters, it moves seniors, it moves allegiances and alliances, and it resonates.”\n\nThe political fight means Washington is delaying a reckoning about how to resolve the long-term finances of the programs. Trustees\' reports say Medicare’s trust fund is fully solvent through 2028 (after that, payments will be cut) and Social Security is solvent through 2035 (after that, scheduled benefits would reduce).\n\nBiden’s remarks indicate that Democrats have ruled out compromises that they pursued during President Barack Obama’s first term to trim long-term benefits as a way to reduce the national debt. Those negotiations drew objections from the left and never materialized into an agreement. Since then, Democrats have turned away from potential cuts and rallied around raising revenues to expand retirement benefits.\n\nIt represents a growing divide with Republicans, who continue to rule out new taxes to finance the benefits and instead believe spending must be curtailed in the long run.\n\nBiden has endorsed raising the payroll tax cap on upper earners to expand Social Security payments. He sought to expand Medicare benefits for dental, vision and hearing services, but that effort was blocked by a few centrists, mainly Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.\n\n\'I\'m sick of his lies\'\n\n“I have no idea what his motivation was but I’m sick of his lies,” Rep. Beth Van Duyne, R-Texas, who looked puzzled in the House chamber as Biden launched his attack on Republicans in his State of the Union speech.\n\n“He has heard on more than enough occasions that Republicans are not looking to cut but looking to protect those programs. And I thought it was all fear-mongering on his part, and an effort to divert from his failed policies,” said Van Duyne, who sits on the Ways and Means Committee that oversees Social Security and Medicare.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who repeatedly yelled “Liar!” during that part of Biden’s speech, said afterward: “He had been lying about Republicans — saying that we were going to cut Social Security, cut Medicare. And I can tell you, I haven’t been in one single meeting in our conference where we even talked about that.”\n\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates said in an email that protecting those programs “is core to President Biden’s top priority” and made it clear he won’t stop calling out plans to scale them back.\n\n“A wide range of Republican lawmakers have endorsed severe cuts to Medicare and Social security benefits in the name of ‘fiscal responsibility,’” Bates said. “Complaining that the President is accurately shining a light on plans they don’t want their constituents to know about is very much not the defense they think.”\n\nMulhauser said it’s “rich” to see Republicans complain about Democrats using a tactic the GOP has often used: Elevating proposals by some in the opposing party and driving the contrast.\n\n“This is similarly a fair fight,” he said. “And it’s particularly so when these Republican positions are codified, documented in print, introduced in legislation.""\n\nAs Republicans insist that the programs are off the table in a debt limit bill to avert default this year, they face a conundrum: Leaving those costly programs untouched is inconsistent with the demands by some conservatives to balance the budget.\n\nBiden’s move to highlight Social Security and Medicare has also raised tensions within the GOP, most notably between Scott and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., whose advisers blame the Florida Republican for hurting GOP candidates in the 2022 election.\n\n“It’s just a bad idea,"" McConnell said Thursday of Scott\'s agenda. ""I think it will be a challenge for him to deal with this in his own re-election in Florida, a state with more elderly people than any other state in America.”\n\nScott, who has stood by his agenda and accused Biden of “lying” about it, claimed Friday that McConnell was backing up the Democratic president.\n\n“He’s backing up Biden again,” Scott said. “He doesn’t believe that we ought to have a plan.”'}}",84.75,1

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Anti-vaccine agitators are still spreading unscientific propaganda, but the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective.', 'Full_text': 'Over the weekend, as I pondered a volume of forgotten lore — it was Emily Wilson’s gripping translation of Homer’s “Odyssey,” actually — my email inbox started filling up with the curious news that a long-discredited and retracted paper claiming that the COVID vaccines had killed nearly 300,000 Americans had been “reinstated.”\n\nIt did not take long to determine that the truth was, no, not really. But the sudden appearance of this claim and its rapid spread across the anti-vaccine ecosystem speak volumes about how “bad papers written by antivax ideologues designed to promote a narrative that vaccines are dangerous and/or ineffective ... never die,” to quote the veteran pseudoscience debunker David Gorski.\n\n“Junk science can often find a home somewhere in the bowels of the literature, but that doesn’t stop it being junk science,” says John P. Moore, professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, whose experience fighting anti-science quackery dates to the AIDS epidemic of the 1990s.\n\nIn this case, the assertion that a retracted paper by Michigan State University economist Mark Skidmore has been resurrected in the peer-reviewed literature is based on “one possibly accurate piece of information, a lie, and a half-truth,” Gorski observes.\n\nLet’s take a look.\n\nI wrote about Skidmore’s paper in April, when it was retracted by its original publisher, the respectable medical journal BMC Infectious Diseases.\n\nPublished in January, the paper had started out as a sort of sociological study of what factors might lead people to be more or less amenable to taking a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nBased on an anonymous database of 2,840 respondents compiled by a third-party survey firm, Skidmore reported that people who knew someone who had a serious bout of COVID illness were more likely to get vaccinated, while knowing someone who appeared to have suffered a post-vaccination injury made them less likely to take the shot.\n\nThat was not especially surprising. But Skidmore proceeded to extrapolate from the number of respondents who said they knew someone who had died from the vaccine to conclude that the number of U.S. vaccine-related deaths “may be as high as 278,000.”\n\nThat claim was taken as gospel truth by the anti-vaccine movement, which helped make the paper one of the most-viewed papers in the journal’s history.\n\nBut there was a problem. Skidmore based his estimate of vaccine-related deaths on the opinions of people who had no way of knowing that the illness or death their acquaintances suffered after vaccination had anything to do with the shot.\n\nAnother red flag was that he relied on the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, or VAERS, as a benchmark database for COVID vaccine injuries.\n\nVAERS is maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which warns explicitly that it’s not suitable for that purpose. That’s because it’s a repository of entirely voluntary reports that can be filed by anyone, including but not limited to doctors, patients and family members, who aren’t required to document the injury.\n\n“VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event,” the CDC says. “A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event.”\n\nWhen serious vaccine scientists see VAERS treated in a paper as an authoritative source for injury estimates, they take it as a sign that the paper is sloppy or even willfully dishonest. As it happens, VAERS is a popular source for anti-vaccine claims of all sorts, especially about the COVID shots.\n\nAs I observed before, there are few fields in which flawed scientific research has been weaponized as much as in studies of COVID treatments. Worthless nostrums such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin have been promoted as COVID treatments based on transparently bogus evidence.\n\nSkidmore disagreed with BMC’s retraction notice in April, and still does. He maintains that BMC’s retraction violated professional standards, although one rule he cited is that a journal has “clear evidence that the findings are unreliable.”\n\nYet BMC’s retraction notice cited “concerns ... regarding the validity of the conclusions drawn after publication.” It said Skidmore’s methodology in estimating vaccine deaths “was inappropriate as it does not prove causal inference of mortality. ... Furthermore, there was no attempt to validate reported fatalities.”\n\n“My article is one piece of evidence among many that the COVID-19 vaccines have resulted in injury and death,” Skidmore told me by email.\n\nThat’s what lawyers might call “assuming facts not in evidence.” For there is no “evidence” in Skidmore’s paper that the vaccines have resulted in injury and death to any degree that would make them more dangerous than contracting COVID-19 — just unsupported conjectures by acquaintances of people who died at some point after getting vaccinated that their deaths resulted from the shots.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelmingly on the other side — that the vaccines have saved millions from the dire consequences of the disease.\n\nThat brings us to the reported “reinstatement.” Or as anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch put it on his Substack blog, “after a 7 month review by his university, Mark Skidmore was exonerated of all charges and his new, improved paper was published in a more credible peer-reviewed journal.”\n\nFollowing Gorski’s formulation, we’ll start with the “one possibly accurate piece of information.” That piece is a ruling by Michigan State’s Institutional Review Board, which oversees the ethics of research involving human subjects. On Sept. 13, the board informed Skidmore that it had found “no noncompliance” with its protocols.\n\nThat may be understandable. Skidmore’s defense against accusations of unethical treatment of human subjects that his critics had brought to the IRB was that he had based his paper on an anonymized third-party database, so he had no direct clinical contact with any human subjects and the research thus “posed little risk to human respondents,” according to Liberty Counsel, the conservative legal group that represented him in discussions with the IRB.\n\nBut that doesn’t get to the core problem of the paper. The “lie,” as Gorski describes it, is Skidmore’s claim that “COVID-19 vaccines might have killed well over a quarter million people by the end of 2021.”\n\nThere are simply no data to support that assertion. Skidmore’s calculation is a wild extrapolation from unreliable reports. It flies in the face of more solid evidence, which validates the CDC and Food and Drug Administration findings that the vaccines are safe. A 2022 FDA study, covering COVID vaccinations through mid-November 2021, found that death reports on VAERS were actually lower than all-cause death rates.\n\nThe most recent CDC statistics showed that of the 26,331 VAERS reports of problems from the bivalent boosters developed by Moderna and Pfizer authorized by the FDA in August 2022 and delivered through last spring, 2,032 were “serious,” a category that presumably includes death.\n\nBecause 55.2 million doses of the boosters had been delivered since then, the rate of “serious” complications came to less than four-thousandths of a percent of doses. And that figure was probably exaggerated, since the VAERS reports are, by their nature, unsubstantiated.\n\nFinally, there’s the “half-truth.” That’s the assertion that Skidmore’s study has been restored to the peer-reviewed literature.\n\nFirst of all, it’s still retracted by BMC, and there are no indications that the journal will backtrack, since its retraction was the result of extended negotiations with the journal editors, ending with Skidmore’s acknowledgment that he had no way of knowing whether the study subjects’ perceptions about their acquaintances’ vaccine-related injuries were accurate.\n\n“Validating reported fatalities is not possible with an anonymous survey,” Skidmore told the editors. Kirsch asserted on Substack that Skidmore’s “new, improved paper was published in a more credible peer-reviewed journal.” Is that so?\n\nThere are barely any differences between the original paper and the new version, which has been published in a journal called “Science, Public Health Policy, and the Law,” issued by the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The institute is a repository and publisher of anti-vaccination reports, including the long-discredited claim that autism is a consequence of childhood vaccinations.\n\nAs for the journal, its editorial board is composed 100% of vaccine skeptics, outright anti-vaxxers and dispensers of medically and scientifically unsupported treatments. Among its most recent articles is one that, amazingly, continues to push the antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, despite overwhelming evidence that it’s useless for the purpose. (That paper’s co-author is Mark Skidmore.)\n\nTo assert, as Kirsch does, that this journal is “more credible” than BMC Infectious Diseases, which is associated with the Nature publishing group, must be some sort of a gag. It’s true that questions have been raised about how BMC came to publish Skidmore’s paper in the first place, but at least the journal retracted it after critics pointed out its flaws.\n\nThe political landscape of COVID remains infected with misinformation on a pandemic scale. The Skidmore case underscores an observation seen in science, business and politics: Bad information always prevails over good information, unless the truth fights back, constantly and vigorously.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/legal/pfizer-is-sued-by-texas-over-covid-19-vaccine-claims-2023-11-30/', 'Headline': 'Pfizer is sued by Texas over COVID vaccine claims | Reuters', 'Snippet': 'The lawsuit seeks to stop New York-based Pfizer from making alleged false claims and silencing ""truthful speech"" about its vaccine, and more than $10 million in fines for violating a Texas law ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 6: {'URL': 'https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/12/texas-sues-pfizer-with-covid-anti-vax-argument-that-is-pure-stupid/', 'Headline': 'Texas sues Pfizer with COVID anti-vax argument that is pure stupid', 'Snippet': 'If Pfizer had waited for all 35,000 or so people in the trial to be exposed to COVID-19 amid widespread lockdowns, it would have needlessly delayed the evaluation and release of the vaccines.', 'Full_text': 'Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Pfizer last week, claiming the pharmaceutical giant ""deceived the public"" by ""unlawfully misrepresenting"" the effectiveness of its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and sought to silence critics.\n\nThe lawsuit also blames Pfizer for not ending the pandemic after the vaccine\'s release in December 2020. ""Contrary to Pfizer’s public statements, however, the pandemic did not end; it got worse"" in 2021, the complaint reads.\n\n""We are pursuing justice for the people of Texas, many of whom were coerced by tyrannical vaccine mandates to take a defective product sold by lies,"" Paxton said in a press release. ""The facts are clear. Pfizer did not tell the truth about their COVID-19 vaccines.""\n\nIn all, Paxton\'s 54-page complaint acts as a compendium of pandemic-era anti-vaccine misinformation and tropes while making a slew of unsupported claims. But, central to the Lone Star State\'s shaky legal argument is one that centers on the standard math Pfizer used to assess the effectiveness of its vaccine: a calculation of relative risk reduction.\n\nThis argument is as unoriginal as it is incorrect. Anti-vaccine advocates have championed this flawed math-based theory since the height of the pandemic. Actual experts have roundly debunked it many times. Still, it appears in all its absurd glory in Paxton\'s lawsuit last week, which seeks $10 million in reparations.\n\nMath argument\n\nBriefly, the lawsuit and the anti-vaccine rhetoric before it argues that Pfizer should have presented its vaccine\'s effectiveness in terms of absolute risk reduction rather than relative risk reduction. Doing so would have made the highly effective COVID-19 vaccine appear extremely ineffective. Based on relative risk reduction in a two-month trial, Pfizer\'s vaccine appeared 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19—as Pfizer advertised. Using the same trial data but calculating absolute risk reduction, however, the vaccine effectiveness would have been 0.85 percent.\n\nThe difference between the two calculations is quite simple: Absolute risk reduction is a matter of subtraction—the percentage point drop in risk of a disease between an untreated and treated group. So, for example, if a group of untreated people have a 60 percent risk of developing a disease, but, when treated, the risk drops to 10 percent, the absolute risk reduction is 50 percent (60 – 10 = 50).\n\nRelative risk reduction involves division—the percent change difference between the two groups\' risks. So, as in the previous example, if a treatment lowers disease risk from 60 percent to 10 percent, the relative risk reduction is 83 percent (50 percent drop / 60 percent initial risk = ~0.83).\n\nBoth numbers can be helpful when weighing the risks and benefits of treatments, but absolute risk reduction is particularly key when there\'s a low risk of a disease. This can be easily understood by simply moving the decimal in the above example. If a treatment lowers a person\'s disease risk from 6 percent to 1 percent, the relative risk reduction is still 83 percent—an impressive number that might argue for treatment—but the absolute risk reduction is a paltry 5 percent—which could easily be negated by any potential side effects or high costs.\n\nCalculation context\n\nSimilar calculations were seen in Pfizer\'s trial: Of 17,411 vaccinated people, eight developed COVID-19 during the trial (0.045 percent), while 162 of 17,511 people in the placebo group developed the infection (0.9 percent). The relative risk reduction is 95 percent, while the absolute risk reduction is a decidedly unimpressive 0.85 percent.\n\nFor this reason, anti-vaccine advocates have seized upon absolute risk calculations as a way to downplay the effectiveness of lifesaving vaccines. But this steamrolls over the reason relative risk is used to examine vaccine effectiveness against infectious disease. Absolute risk is most helpful when it\'s relatively stable and can be confidently calculated, such as calculating the risk of cardiovascular disease in a person, given their blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In these cases, absolute risk reduction is very helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment. But using absolute risk for infectious diseases is often simply nonsensical because absolute risk can vary dramatically by space, time, and many other factors.\n\nFor instance, a person\'s absolute risk of flu drops significantly when it\'s not flu season. Or, if a person hops on a plane, traveling from an area with no endemic malaria directly into an area with a raging malaria outbreak, their absolute risk of infection will skyrocket when they land. And, of course, if people are under lockdowns or health restrictions—as was the case early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Pfizer\'s vaccine trials were running—their absolute risk can rise significantly when those lockdowns and restrictions are lifted—as was the case in 2021 after the vaccine\'s release.\n\nWith absolute risk so variable, relative risk is a more helpful measure of a vaccine\'s effectiveness—and the relative risk reduction applies regardless of what a person\'s absolute risk is at a given point in time.\n\nArtificial numbers\n\nAnother key reason it\'s safe to ignore absolute risk reduction in vaccine trial data is that it is often entirely artificial. These trials are designed to enroll large numbers of people with the full knowledge that only a small percentage will be exposed during the trial. And they\'re designed with trigger points—in other words, when the trial hits a pre-determined number of infections, effectiveness is calculated.\n\nIn Pfizer\'s trial, the trigger point was at or around 170. But, if the trial runners had set the trigger point somewhere else, the absolute risk reduction could easily have been different, even if everything else was the same. For instance, if it was set to 510 and there were 24 cases in the vaccine groups (0.13 percent) and 486 cases in the placebo group (2.8 percent), the relative risk reduction would still be 95 percent, but the absolute risk reduction would be 2.67 percent, not 0.85 percent.\n\nIf Pfizer had waited for all 35,000 or so people in the trial to be exposed to COVID-19 amid widespread lockdowns, it would have needlessly delayed the evaluation and release of the vaccines.\n\nAn analysis from last year estimated that COVID-19 vaccines prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and more than 3 million deaths in the first two years after their release.\n\nIn a statement to Stat, Pfizer noted the benefits and safety of its vaccine, saying that its representations of its vaccine ""have been accurate and science-based. [Pfizer] believes that the state’s case has no merit and will respond to the petition in court in due course.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/965135', 'Headline': ""BMJ Slams 'Incompetent' Facebook Fact-Check of Vaccine Article - Medscape"", 'Snippet': 'It was previously reported that the whistle-blower is a former regional director who was involved in Pfizer\'s vaccine trials in Texas during the fall of 2020.

But a popular YouTube video spins a conspiracy theory that distorts legal codes to falsely claim otherwise.\n\nFull Story\n\nAll of the four COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. were tested in large, randomized controlled trials for safety and efficacy before the FDA granted them emergency use authorization and they were rolled out to the public.\n\nTwo of the vaccines are now fully approved: the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots. These are the vaccines the vast majority of vaccinated Americans have received.\n\nAs is standard in clinical trials, the volunteers in the COVID-19 vaccine trials were informed of the risks and benefits so they could decide whether to participate, or what is known as informed consent.\n\nYet a Jan. 7 YouTube video that racked up more than 300,000 views in its first three days falsely claims the trials were a sham. The video also incorrectly suggests the trial participants did not give informed consent.\n\n“A bombshell new report shows that the Department of Defense — yes the pentagon — controlled the COVID-19 program from the very beginning, and everything we were told was political theater, basically to cover it up, right down to the FDA vaccine approval process,” says host Clayton Morris, at the start of the video. “It was all theater. That means that human beings were used as props.”\n\nThe 17-minute video is an episode of the YouTube show Redacted, which Morris co-hosts with his wife and which has previously trafficked in misinformation, including about COVID-19. Morris is a former “Fox & Friends” host and real estate investor who moved to Portugal following fraud allegations by former clients.\n\nThe video features Alexandra, or Sasha, Latypova, who is described as “a former executive of a pharmaceutical contract research organization.” She has previously made media appearances with organizations opposed to vaccines, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Children’s Health Defense, and has written for the pseudoscientific website TrialSiteNews.\n\nIn the Redacted interview, Latypova makes a series of false claims, many predicated on her misreading of government contracts and the legal code. Lawyers with expertise in the area told us the claims are bunk.\n\nFalse Claim About ‘Theatrical’ Clinical Trials\n\nLatypova kicks off her interview by claiming “the Department of Defense used very shady contracting practices and also used several laws that were put in place previously … to shield pharmaceutical companies, to not conduct, you know, proper clinical trials.”\n\n“As a result, we have this theatrical performance called clinical trials, but they were actually not real,” she continues. “Based on the laws that are used here and then involved in this process, clinical trials are not required at all. And, and in fact they cannot be conducted.”\n\nThis is patently false. All of the vaccine clinical trials were very much real. Not only have thousands of Americans participated in these trials, some of whom have been interviewed for news stories, but there are reams of data from these trials that the FDA reviewed prior to issuing the emergency use authorizations and the approvals.\n\nThese data were also reviewed by multiple independent review groups for the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in publicly accessible meetings, and the results were also published in peer-reviewed journals. The notion that these trials were not real strains credulity and requires conspiratorial thinking.\n\nLatypova’s mischaracterization likely stems from her misreading of the laws governing emergency use authorizations, or EUAs. It’s true that an EUA, which can cover a variety of diagnostics, treatments or vaccines during an exceptional situation such as a pandemic, is different from a full approval — and does not necessarily require a clinical trial.\n\nHowever, the legal code specifically says that an EUA can consider data “from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if available.” And for the COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA made clear in guidance that clinical trials were required.\n\nAn October 2020 FDA guidance document states that for a COVID-19 vaccine “for which there is adequate manufacturing information to ensure its quality and consistency, issuance of an EUA would require a determination by FDA that the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its risks based on data from at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner.”\n\n“For vaccines (and new drugs like Paxlovid, which also received an EUA) the FDA always requires clinical trials,” Villanova University law professor Ana Santos Rutschman told us. “Technically, guidance is not binding,” she added, “but we’ve never seen FDA depart significantly from guidance it issues in any of these areas.”\n\nAnd of course, trials were indeed performed for all of the vaccines that received an EUA, contrary to Latypova’s claim that they were fake.\n\n“The difference between an EUA and other forms of regulation is that the standard for effectiveness is that ‘it is reasonable to believe’ that a product is effective,” Rutschman explained. “‘Reasonable to believe’ is a lower standard than the one required for full approval; this means that companies are able to submit clinical trial data to the FDA sooner than they normally would under the full approval pathway. But the clinical trials still have to be ok’ed by the FDA, which also reviews all the data generated during the trials, and keeps monitoring the product even after it is authorized under an EUA, as well as after full approval.”\n\n“Sasha Latypova’s argument is a classic example of a causal fallacy,” Jacob S. Sherkow, a law professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told us. “Latypova assumes that because some clinical investigations are not required under an EUA, they could not have occurred.”\n\n“It’s bogus as a matter of law, as a matter [of] logic, and a matter of fact,” he added.\n\nFalse Informed Consent Claim\n\nAnother of Latypova’s false claims is the suggestion that informed consent wasn’t obtained in the COVID-19 vaccine trials.\n\nShe cites the 21st Century Cures Act signed in 2016 by President Barack Obama, saying the law changed “the informed consent requirements, such that subjects don’t have to be necessarily informed of what’s going on if it’s deemed not in their best interest.”\n\nLatypova proceeds to suggest that this is what happened in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. “They don’t have to inform the subjects what it is, they can use a lot of secrecy, they don’t have to run clinical trials, they’re not required, because these products cannot be investigational products, that’s what the law says,” she says, repeating her claim about the trials. “If they cannot be investigational products, then we don’t have any investigation, we don’t have any clinical trial subjects. So that’s how they’re pulling this off.”\n\n“[I]t’s just nonsense,” Sherkow said. “There’s nothing in the CURES Act that says, ‘No informed consent for clinical trials.’”\n\nRutschman agreed, noting that the Cures Act allows for small modifications to informed consent in certain situations, but does not “do away with informed consent requirements.”\n\nOther scientists have published research analyzing the informed consent documents used in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. While the researchers concluded the forms should have been shorter and easier to read, it’s simply not true that such forms did not exist.\n\nLatypova’s related legal claim about “investigational products” refers to a particular part of the legal code about EUAs (21 U.S. Code § 360bbb–3(k)) that states the use of an EUA product “shall not be considered to constitute a clinical investigation.” But Rutschman said Latypova’s interpretation of those words is “entirely incorrect.”\n\nRather than meaning that an EUA product cannot be studied in a clinical trial, as Latypova has incorrectly assumed, the law is saying that an EUA product still needs to be studied or continued to be studied in a clinical trial to receive full approval, Rutschman said.\n\n“The provision is saying this is a particular pathway to bring products to market during an emergency, but use of these products is not a clinical investigation; if you’re going to seek full approval you have to continue running trials even as you make the vaccines/drugs available under an EUA,” she explained.\n\nOther Assorted Claims\n\nAmong Latypova’s numerous other false claims (we aren’t covering them all) is the suggestion that the pandemic was “planned” and that an unnamed “they” — presumably the government — want to relinquish control to the World Health Organization.\n\n“The pre-planning goes [back] years,” Latypova says. “For example, there is pandemic enterprise. It’s a quasi-private, quasi-government enterprise that’s been set up in 2013 that involves 10 heads of federal agencies.” She calls the group a “cabal” and claims the majority of the efforts were focused on maintaining secrecy.\n\n“It’s almost like they knew this was coming,” Morris interjects. “This is where we talk about conspiracy theories on the show. I mean, it’s all true.”\n\nIt’s unclear which entity Latypova has in mind. The most likely candidate is a group known as the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise. It’s primarily made up of officials in multiple agencies, but includes industry partners, and helps to coordinate the government’s response during public health emergencies. It was created in 2006.\n\nIn any case, it’s incorrect to suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. Conspiracy theorists have made similar claims before, as we’ve written. The reality is that well before 2019, scientists and government officials had been concerned about pandemics, including those caused by coronaviruses. Trying to prepare for them is not evidence that they were orchestrated or planned.\n\nNear the end of the video, Morris suggests that “they’re already planning the next one” — presumably referring to the government and the next pandemic — and Latypova agrees.\n\n“The next important thing that they want to do is give up our sovereignty to WHO,” she says, referring to the International Health Regulations.\n\nWe’ve explained before that the WHO can make recommendations for countries to follow during global health emergencies, but the WHO doesn’t have authority over countries to force compliance.\n\nIt’s worth noting that while Latypova and Morris make much of the Department of Defense’s role in the COVID-19 vaccine program, there is nothing unusual about it.\n\n“DoD is always very involved in vaccine R&D,” Rutschman said, noting that historically, many vaccine-preventable diseases occur outside of the U.S. where American troops are often deployed. “[I]t’s totally normal for DoD to be the contracting agency; as funders, they have an interest in demanding that their funding recipients perform R&D that is compliant with FDA regs and likely to obtain authorization/approval if the resulting product is good.”\n\nAs for the claim the Department of Defense used “shady” contracting methods, Rutschman explained that the contracting mechanism, known as “other transaction authority,” or OTA, simply allows the department to purchase items or services quickly — and is hardly unprecedented.\n\n“DoD had used the OTA pathway many times before COVID-19,” she said. “This form of contracting enables the government to move faster; it is perfectly legal and well-regulated.”\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s articles correcting health misinformation are made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40940-4', 'Headline': 'Effects of public-health measures for zeroing out different ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China. From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00873-X/fulltext', 'Headline': 'Zero COVID in China: what next? - The Lancet', 'Snippet': ""The zero-COVID strategy has been the pillar of China's anti-epidemic policies for over 2 years.

Based on these values, we estimated that ...', 'Full_text': 'Understanding the official case count data during the different phases of public health policy\n\nWe first aimed to understand the spread of the Omicron variant in China immediately before the relaxation of zero-COVID (i.e., between Oct. 28 and Nov. 11, 2022). Under zero-COVID, testing was mandatory and frequent, leading the official case count data to be a reliable portrayal of the levels of COVID-19 infection in China. Despite the strict measures, such as frequent city-wide lock-downs, travel and movement restrictions, and compulsory quarantine of infected individuals, the data show a clear exponential increase in COVID-19 cases (caused by the extremely transmissible Omicron variants) shortly before the relaxation of zero-COVID (Fig. 1a). Using a negative binomial regression, we estimated the rate of this exponential growth to be 0.14/day (95% CI: [0.13, 0.15]/day) during this period.\n\nOfficial data after Nov. 11 (when zero-COVID was replaced by 20 Measures and subsequently 10 Measures) report that growth of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic slowed (Fig. 1a), and eventually the official daily reported cases declined after Nov. 27. This pattern is unexpected. Presumably, the relaxation of strict interventions under zero-COVID would lead to more rapid spread, contrary to what is observed from the official case count data. We reason that the only plausible explanation is the cessation of the requirement for mass testing and rigorous reporting, which led to a rapid decoupling of the surveillance data from the epidemic intensity. As a result, the official case count data after Nov. 11 reflect the rapidly declining detection rate rather than real change in the infection dynamics.\n\nEstimating SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Nov. and Dec. 2022\n\nTo compensate for the under-reported official case count data after Nov. 11, we collected results from a large online survey conducted on Dec. 26, 2022 by a website for the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security13. The survey reported the fraction of individuals in three categories: those who thought they had never been infected, thought they currently had COVID-19 symptoms, or thought they had been but were no longer symptomatic (see “Methods” for details). Note that these survey categories do not directly correspond to the epidemiological states of susceptible, infected, and recovered, because each person is reporting based on symptoms and does not know their true infectiousness status. In particular, individuals may become infectious before their symptoms begin, and their symptoms may linger even after they are no longer infectious. When interpreted correctly, however, these data should provide insight into the epidemic stage and thus allow inference of the epidemic dynamics.\n\nWe developed an expanded susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model that mapped reporting based on symptoms to true infection status. The states of the model are explained in Fig. 2, and equations and further details are provided in “Methods”. We separated the model into three time periods to allow changes in official policy to affect the transmission rate (Fig. 1a). Official case counts were reliable for the first period, up to Nov. 11, due to mandatory and frequent testing. There is no clear observation for the second period, so we simply assumed the transmission rate must be no less than in the first period. The dynamics of the third period were then mainly determined by the population survey data on Dec. 26.\n\nOur model assumes no pre-existing population immunity against Omicron. We calculated the levels of vaccine-induced population immunity against Omicron infection based on published vaccination data14 and the decay of vaccine effectiveness against infection15 (see “Methods” and Fig. S2). We found that the population immunity before the Dec. 2022 wave of Omicron was below 0.1%, and thus would have negligible effect on the model inference.\n\nFitting the model to the case count and survey data, we estimated that the outbreak in China grew exponentially at a rate of 0.15/day (95% credibility interval (CrI): [0.13, 0.15]/day) under zero-COVID between Oct. 28 and Nov. 11, increased slightly to 0.17 [0.14, 0.17]/day under 20 Measures, and increased dramatically to 0.42 [0.35, 0.44]/day immediately after full exit from zero-COVID (Fig. 1c), with the epidemic then peaking around Dec. 23 (Fig. 1d). This translates to an epidemic doubling time of 4.7 [4.5, 5.4] days, 4.2 [4.0, 5.0] days, and 1.6 [1.6, 2.0] days for the three periods, respectively.\n\nAssuming a mean generation interval of 3.3 days for Omicron16 (see “Methods”), we calculated the reproductive number, Rexp, during the exponential increase stage of the three periods. It increased from 1.57 [1.49, 1.59] during the end of zero-COVID to 3.13 [2.66, 3.27] at the start of the full exit from zero-COVID (Table S1, Fig. 1c). Based on these values, we estimated that the zero-COVID policy prior to relaxation suppressed the transmission of these Omicron variants by 56% [46%, 64%].\n\nOur results suggest that on Dec. 7, the day when full exit from zero-COVID was announced, there were ~1 million new infections. Because of the extremely high rate of spread afterwards, the outbreak ballooned such that 97% [95%, 99%] of the population (i.e., 1.37 billion people) became infected in December. As a result of the exponential nature of the spread, the vast majority of people (88% [83%, 93%] of the population) became infected during the short window of time between Dec. 15 and 31, 2022 (Fig. 1d).\n\nRobustness to model and data assumptions\n\nWe tested the robustness of our findings—particularly, that nearly the entire population became infected in Dec. 2022—to many properties of the data and model.\n\nFirst, we previously assumed that the numbers of confirmed cases from Oct. 28 to Nov. 11 represented the actual number of infected individuals, i.e., that the case reporting rate in China was 100%. This is a reasonable approximation because of the mandatory mass testing in place: all individuals were required to get tested every 2–5 days. However, it is possible that some infected individuals were not detected. We therefore considered an alternative in which the reporting rate was only 50%. Here, the estimated growth rate after Dec. 7 was reduced slightly to 0.40/day, the size of the susceptible population by the end of Dec. remained below 4%, and the epidemic again peaked on Dec. 23 (Fig. S3).\n\nSecond, we previously assumed the Dec. 26 survey results were an unbiased random sample of the entire population. If, however, recovered people were more likely to respond to the survey, or people reported symptoms not due to COVID-19 (e.g., instead due to influenza—an unlikely scenario given the recent report by China CDC5), the numbers of symptomatic or recovered individuals would be over-reported and our growth rate estimate would be too high. We therefore made a large perturbation of the Dec. 26 data by moving 20% of people from each of the symptomatic and recovered categories into the uninfected category. The estimated growth rate was then reduced slightly to 0.39/day after Dec. 7, the size of the susceptible population by Dec. 31 remained below 4%, and the epidemic peak moved slightly to Dec. 24 (Fig. S4).\n\nThird, in our inference of the transmission rates, we fixed many parameter values from the literature. We tested the sensitivity of our results to those assumed values by re-fitting the model using different values. In one strategy, we set the value of each state transition parameter (kE, kIP, kIS, kS, kA, and kT; all defined in Fig. 2, Table S3, Eq. 1) to either 25% higher or lower than our baseline value (Fig. S5). In another strategy, we assigned an appropriate amount of uncertainty to the incubation period, pre-symptomatic period, symptomatic period, generation interval, and time to PCR testing, drew values from each distribution, and derived the state transition parameters (details in Table S3); this was repeated 25 times. In all cases, the median exponential growth rate remained above 0.25/day after Dec. 7, the median size of the population still susceptible by Dec. 31 remained <6% and the 95% CrI remained <10%, and the epidemic peak remained between Dec. 21–25.\n\nFourth, we previously assumed that the entire population is well-mixed. If, however, population structure exists such that people who have high contact rates (and thus potentially more exposure to infection, such as people who live in urban areas or younger age groups) were also more likely to be represented in the data, our results could over-state the total number of infected people by failing to recognize subpopulations that remain uninfected because of their lower contact rates. To test the impact of population structure on our conclusions, we extended our model to build a meta-population model with two subpopulations: one with high contact rates and the other with low contact rates. We assumed that the official case counts and the Dec. 26 survey data were taken from the population with higher contact rates (the sampled population) and the population with lower contact rates (the unsampled population) was not represented in the datasets. We considered various scenarios with different assumptions about the contact rates between the two subpopulations and the contact rate in the unsampled population (see Fig. S6 and “Methods”). In general, we found an epidemic peak on Dec. 23 or Dec. 24, and that >90% of the entire population was infected by the end of Dec. (Fig. S7), consistent with our main findings. This suggests that for a virus that transmits extremely efficiently and rapidly, like Omicron, population structure and heterogeneity play only a small role in dictating the overall rate and magnitude of the epidemic, as long as subpopulations are not entirely isolated from each other.\n\nOverall, allowing for under-reporting of official case count data before Nov. 11, over-reporting of symptoms in the Dec. 26 survey, uncertainty in parameter values taken from the literature, or population sub-structure did not change our conclusions.\n\nModel validation using additional datasets\n\nWe furthermore validated our results by comparing them against datasets and analyses that were not used in the inference above. First, China CDC subsequently released data on voluntary PCR and antigen tests for most of Dec. 2022 and Jan. 20235. After the full exit from zero-COVID, the test strategy was changed from all population-based to those who request to be tested and groups at risk. The total number of tests declined from a peak of 150 million tests on Dec. 9, to 7.54 million on Jan. 1. The test positivity rate ranged between a few percent to a peak of 29.4% on Dec. 255. Although these data may not directly reveal the magnitude of the true case counts because of the voluntary nature of the reports, they can reveal the pace and the peak timing of the epidemic. We adjusted our model predictions to reflect the nature of voluntary tests (see “Methods”), and found surprisingly close agreement with the national testing data in Dec. 2022 (Fig. 3).\n\nSecond, the Sichuan CDC conducted a large daily survey in which residents of the province reported their infection status, the date of test positivity, and the date of symptom onset17. We found that the exponential growth rate of the epidemic in early Dec. in Sichuan, as measured by test positivity or symptom onset (0.37/day or 0.43/day, respectively; Fig. S8) is remarkably consistent with our estimates above for the country as a whole.\n\nThird, an analysis of self-reported infection rate focused on vaccine efficacy but also reported an epidemic curve18. Based on 2316 survey responses, the study reported that 82.4% of people in China had confirmed cases by Feb. 2023. This number excludes, however, asymptomatic cases that were not revealed by testing. If 9% of infected people never developed symptoms (median value from Fig. S1) and most of those cases were not caught by testing (due to the lack of mandatory testing and the lack of incentive for most non-symptomatic people to test themselves, leading to the high test positivity rate by end-Dec5.), it is likely that more than 90% of people in that survey had been infected. The small sample size of that survey would also induce large uncertainty, leading to a result for the final epidemic size that is not inconsistent with our model-based analysis on larger datasets.\n\nWe modeled the epidemic dynamics of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in China from Nov. to Dec. 2022, during a period when China moved from having strict COVID-19 policies (‘zero-COVID’), to little-to-no intervention efforts. We found that after full exit from zero-COVID, the Omicron variant spread at a very high rate of 0.42/day, with a doubling time of 1.6 days, during early and mid-Dec. before the incidence peaked around Dec. 23. Our point estimate is that 97% of the population (1.4 billion people) was infected during December, with a lower 95% credibility interval of 95% of the population (1.33 billion) and a lower limit in the sensitivity analyses of 90% (1.26 billion). With an infection fatality ratio between 0.1 and 0.2% for the Omicron variant19, we would expect between 1.3 and 2.6 million COVID-19 deaths in China during Dec. 2022 as well as Jan. 2023 (because of the delay from infection to death).\n\nInfection of more than one billion people during one month would lead to a large number of people needing health care, far exceeding the hospital capacity, and thus explains the report that hospitals were overwhelmed during this period6. This outcome emphasizes the need for gradually relaxing intervention efforts (instead of abruptly changing policy) and implementing additional measures (e.g., pharmaceutical strategies) to ‘flatten the curve’9. A slower epidemic wave would help to ease hospital burden, allow sufficient health care for infected people, prevent epidemic overshoot (i.e., a large final epidemic size because of rapid spread20), and ultimately reduce the number of deaths. Such considerations may be of renewed importance later in 2023, when the large cohort of people infected at the end of 2022 may become susceptible to reinfection.\n\nOur results differ from a recent paper by Leung et al.21 that modeled the epidemic dynamics in Beijing over a similar period. First, they estimated that the highest rate of epidemic growth occurred in mid-Nov., a period when substantial intervention efforts were still in place, whereas our estimates suggest the rate of epidemic growth was highest after the full exit from zero-COVID. Second, they estimated that the epidemic incidence in Beijing had two peaks (one on Dec. 10 and another on Dec. 21), whereas we estimated the epidemic in China as a whole peaked on Dec. 23, remarkably consistent with the newly released data from China CDC5 (Fig. 3). These results in Leung et al.21 are strongly driven by the assumption that the overall contact rate is a function of the daily number of subway travelers, which peaked mid-November. However, it is unclear how the number of subway passengers is related to transmission, given that a large fraction of transmission likely occurs in the household22. More generally, it has been shown that human mobility after the first wave of the epidemic in 2020 relates to changes in transmission in complex ways23; the relationship between the mobility measures and transmission can be insignificant in many countries, country-specific, or intervention policy-specific. As a result, the results in Leung et al.21 could be biased by this strong assumption.\n\nOne limitation of our analysis is that it is heavily dependent on the online infection status survey data on Dec. 26. We directly addressed two concerns about these data. First, the survey could over-state the progression of the epidemic if people with symptoms are more likely to take the survey, or if people mistake influenza for COVID-19 symptoms. Recent data from the China CDC report5 shows that among individuals who had influenza-like illnesses and were tested for both COVID-19 and influenza, only a very small fraction were positive for influenza, especially in late Dec. Nevertheless, we artificially increased the proportion of uninfected people in the survey and obtained very similar results. Second, because the survey was conducted online, the demographic characteristics of the participants may be different from the general population. In particular, if a substantial subpopulation did not participate in the survey and also experienced lower rates of spread—for example, people living in sparsely populated areas—our estimate of the total number of people infected could be too high. We tested this assumption by fitting a structured population model and obtained very similar results. Finally, we validated our model findings against other data sources that were not used in our model inference. We found strong concordance with both the estimated peak time of the epidemic and its growth trajectory. These many lines of evidence strongly suggest that our estimation is reliable and robust, despite the limitations of the available data.\n\nAnother piece of evidence supporting our conclusion is the lack of a COVID-19 wave in January 2023 (for example, see the China CDC report5). The Chinese New Year travel rush, i.e., during which many migrant workers and students go back to hometown to celebrate the Chinese New Year, occurred in Jan., and a large fraction of these travel routes would be from cities to rural villages. Presumably, this travel rush would increase the frequency of risky contact substantially throughout China. The fact that there is no indication of any sizable COVID outbreak during this period (e.g., indicators of COVID-19 infection, including positive tests and fever clinic visits, decreased continuously throughout Jan. 20235) strongly suggests that a large majority of individuals are already infected in Dec., as we predicted in the model.\n\nBroader implications for understanding the transmission of the Omicron variant and for public health\n\nUnlike most other countries where there existed sizable levels of population immunity against the Omicron variant arising from recent natural infection and/or vaccination, we estimated that the population in China had very little to no protection against the Omicron variant. Therefore, the growth rate 0.42/day (translating to an epidemic doubling time of 1.6 days) during the exponential growth period we estimated may be a good approximation of the intrinsic transmissibility of the variants BA.5 and BF.7 in a densely populated area without population immunity. This is in stark contrast to the growth rate 0.29/day (and an epidemic doubling time of 2.4 days) that we estimated for the Wuhan outbreak before intervention efforts were in place in Jan. 202024. This highlights the extremely high intrinsic transmissibility of the Omicron variant in a naive population.\n\nAssuming a mean generation interval of 3.3 days16, we estimated the reproductive number during exponential growth, Rexp to be 3.1. Note that a recent study using contact tracing data from Italy estimated the intrinsic generation time to be 6.8 days25, although the realized generation time for household transmission where frequent contacts occur between family members was 3.6 days. This relatively large difference in the estimated generation times suggests another layer of complexity in calculating the reproductive number, i.e., it depends on whether the transmission is mostly driven by household transmission (frequent contacts) or non-household transmission (less frequent contacts), which may change in different epidemiological contexts and epidemic stages. The reproductive number, Rexp, we calculated here is likely accurate when the transmission is dominated by household transmission, e.g., when prevalence is relatively high in a community. However, at the beginning of an epidemic when only a few individuals are infected, the transmission is likely to be a mixture of household and non-household transmission; in this case, the basic reproductive number, R0, is likely to be higher than Rexp we estimated here.\n\nQuantifying the growth rates before and after zero-COVID, we estimated these intervention efforts reduced the transmission of the Omicron variant by around 56%. As a comparison, the effect of lock-down during the spread of the original variant in early 2020 was estimated to be 70–80% in Europe26. Interestingly, the Omicron outbreak in China had already been growing in Nov. 2022 before the relaxation of zero-COVID (albeit at a low rate). This may reflect the high transmissibilty of the variant, and that the stringent measures of the zero-COVID policy were not effectively implemented because of factors such as population noncompliance due to pandemic fatigue. Nonetheless, these results highlight the difficulty of containing a respiratory infection that causes explosive outbreaks and transmits during the presymptomatic or asymptomatic period.\n\nBecause the epidemic grew so rapidly in Dec., we may expect another sizable wave of infection later in 2023 when the large cohort of people infected at the end of 2022 become susceptible to reinfection. The timing and magnitude of the future wave would depend on how quickly the population immunity wanes over time27,28,29 and the ability of newly emerging variants to evade the immunity caused by the Omicron variants30,31. Therefore, modeling efforts that evaluate intervention strategies, including vaccination, will be crucial to reduce the level of infection and mortality.\n\nDatasets and sources\n\nOfficial case counts\n\nNational Health Commission (NHC) of the People’s Republic of China had been releasing reports on COVID-19 infections from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 23, 202232. These reports include numbers of symptomatic, asymptomatic, imported and recovered infections, and deaths across the country. Because the definitions of ‘symptomatic’ and ‘asymptomatic’ infections have been changing over time, we use only the total number of cases by summing the two categories. We retrieved all official data from Sina Pandemic Map33, which provides pre-processed and well-organized daily case data from NHC. Note the NHC data are also used as a source for the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard34.\n\nPrevalence survey on Dec. 26, 2022\n\nOn Dec. 26, 2022, the RenSheTong online platform (https://m12333.cn), a website for the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, conducted a one-day online survey of the COVID-19 infection status for people living in China13. There were 47,897 participants in total. In the questionnaire, participants were asked about their infection status and their duration of symptoms. Infection status was reported in four categories. ‘Uninfected’ was defined as individuals who had never tested positive or were unaware they were infected. ‘Asymptomatic’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive, but did not have symptoms of infection at the time of the survey. ‘Symptomatic’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive or thought they were infected, and were experiencing symptoms at the time of the survey. ‘Recovered’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive or thought they had been infected by COVID-19 in the past, and had recovered from symptoms of infection. We interpreted the last category to imply recovered from recent infection, i.e., in end-2022, but there would be little consequence if it also included people who had been infected in previous years because <1% of the population had been infected prior to Nov. 202234. Survey questions are reproduced in Table S2 and survey results by province are provided in a supplemental data file. Because of the small number of respondents in the Asymptomatic category, our analyses folded them in with the Uninfected category, which already included individuals who could be infected but without symptoms. Note that in the survey 95% of infected people reported symptoms, which is consistent with the fraction of infections estimated to be symptomatic by our model (Fig. S1). We computed the total number of people in each survey category under the assumption that the proportion of survey respondents in each category was representative of the respective province as a whole. That is, the prevalences in Fig. 1b are the country’s total population size multiplied by 28.3% Uninfected, 42.5% Infected, and 29.2% Recovered.\n\nParticipants in the survey were also asked about the duration of symptoms. We fitted an Erlang distribution to the survey data by estimating the mean of the distribution and adjusting the shape parameter of the Erlang distribution from 1 to 10.\n\nChinese CDC reports of number of positive tests after Dec. 9, 2022\n\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention released national COVID-19 pandemic data on Jan. 25, 2023, including PCR test results, antigen test results, outpatient and inpatient data, variant surveillance data, and vaccination progress across the country5. Data were collected from official surveillance systems, labs, hospitals, and mobile applications where residents could upload their antigen test results voluntarily. We used daily numbers of positive PCR and antigen tests and daily test positivity rates.\n\nSichuan survey on Dec. 25 and 26, 2022\n\nThe Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention Health conducted an online survey of the COVID-19 infection status for people living in Sichuan province on Dec. 24 and 2517. There were a total of 158,506 participants. In the questionnaire, participants were asked about their infection status and their duration of symptoms. Infection status was categorized as ‘uninfected’ or ‘tested positive either by PCR or antigen test.’ In addition, participants reported the date that they tested positive and the date of their symptom onset.\n\nCopies of all datasets are included as supplemental files.\n\nThe expanded SEIR model\n\nWe developed an SEIR-type model to encompass not only the daily case counts from extensive official testing, but also the survey data in which respondents’ answers were based on symptoms. In this model, we categorized the population into 12 classes, plus 2 additional classes for bookkeeping: S for susceptible, E1 and E2 for exposed, IP for pre-symptomatic and infectious, IS for symptomatic and infectious, RS1, RS2, and RS3 for recovered from infectiousness but still symptomatic, RS for recovered and no longer with symptoms, IA1 and IA2 for asymptomatic and infectious, and RA for recovered and never having symptoms. Multiple stages were used for some categories (e.g., stages E1 and E2 for the exposed category) in order to obtain more realistic distributions of waiting times35, as discussed below. States T1 and T2 were used to record individuals who test positive, in order to compare with daily case counts. Figure 2 shows how individuals transit from one class to another. Parameters ki govern the rates of flow from one class to the next, f is the fraction of infected individuals who eventually develop symptoms, and w is the proportion of cases found by testing. The system of equations defining this model is:\n\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt}=-\\beta ({I}_{P}+{I}_{S}+{I}_{A1}+{I}_{A2})S/N$$\n\n(1a)\n\n$$\\frac{d{E}_{1}}{dt}=\\beta ({I}_{P}+{I}_{S}+{I}_{A1}+{I}_{A2})S/N-{k}_{E}{E}_{1}$$\n\n(1b)\n\n$$\\frac{d{E}_{2}}{dt}={k}_{E}{E}_{1}-{k}_{E}{E}_{2}$$\n\n(1c)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{P}}{dt}={k}_{E}f{E}_{2}-{k}_{IP}{I}_{P}$$\n\n(1d)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{S}}{dt}={k}_{IP}{I}_{P}-{k}_{IS}{I}_{S}$$\n\n(1e)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S1}}{dt}={k}_{IS}{I}_{S}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S1}$$\n\n(1f)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S2}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S1}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S2}$$\n\n(1g)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S3}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S2}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S3}$$\n\n(1h)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S3}$$\n\n(1i)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{A1}}{dt}={k}_{E}(1-f){E}_{2}-{k}_{A}{I}_{A1}$$\n\n(1j)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{A2}}{dt}={k}_{A}{I}_{A1}-{k}_{A}{I}_{A2}$$\n\n(1k)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{A}}{dt}={k}_{A}{I}_{A2}$$\n\n(1l)\n\n$$\\frac{d{T}_{1}}{dt}={k}_{E}w{E}_{2}-{k}_{T}{T}_{1}$$\n\n(1m)\n\n$$\\frac{d{T}_{2}}{dt}={k}_{T}{T}_{1}$$\n\n(1n)\n\nIn this model, susceptible individuals are infected by infectious individuals (in compartments IP + IS + IA1 + IA2) through contacts at rate β. Infected individuals first become exposed but not infectious. We used two compartments (E1 and E2) to model this period to reflect the fact that the distribution of the exposed period (i.e., from infection to becoming infectious) usually follows a gamma distribution rather than an exponential distribution. Exposed individuals then become infectious, and IP and IS represent infectious individuals at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages, respectively. Individuals lose infectiousness a few days after symptom onset36, whereas symptoms may last for a longer period of time. Stages RS1, RS2, and RS3 describe symptomatic individuals who are no longer infectious. Again, using three stages allows us to match the distribution of the symptomatic period to the distribution estimated from data13. Note that, in the survey, participants in the ‘infected’ category were categorized based on whether the participants have COVID symptoms or not. Therefore, the ‘infected’ category corresponds to individuals in the states IS, RS1, RS2, and RS3. When individuals recover from symptoms, they enter state RS.\n\nOur model also keeps track of asymptomatically infected individuals, i.e., individuals who never develop symptoms throughout infection. In the model, we assume a fraction, 1 − f, of individuals remain asymptomatic after the exposed period. We use two IA stages to describe the duration of infectious period as a gamma distribution. RA keeps track of individuals recovered from asymptomatic infection. We do not differentiate the stages of individuals recovering from asymptomatic infection (as we did for individuals recovering from symptomatic infection) because individuals in all of these stages would have reported as the same category in the symptoms-based survey, and they remain in this class.\n\nOverall, our model structure allowed us to map our model states to the categories in the Dec. 26 online survey. People who reported themselves ‘uninfected’ could be truly susceptible (S), asymptomatic but exposed (E1, E2) or infected (IA1, IA2), or recovered never having had symptoms (RA). People who reported themselves ‘infected’ were experiencing symptoms, so they could be still infectious (IS) or no longer infectious (RS1, RS2, RS3). People reporting themselves ‘recovered’ were no longer experiencing symptoms (RS).\n\nTo fit the model to official COVID-19 case counts, we used T1 and T2 to keep track of individuals who would eventually be tested. Note that they do not contribute to the transmission dynamics. Parameter w is the fraction of infected individuals who are tested, and it ranges between 0 and 1. The waiting time from becoming infectious to being tested positive is 1/kT.\n\nParameter values and statistical inference\n\nWe fixed most of the parameters in the model to values estimated from epidemiological studies. We used an incubation period for Omicron of mean 3.4 days37 and a generation interval for Omicron of mean 3.3 days16. Both distributions can be approximated by a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 3, so in our model there are three states describing individuals who are infected but yet to develop symptoms (E1, E2, and IP). We then set the rate parameters kE = 2/1.9 /day and kIP = 1/1.5 /day so that the mean pre-symptomatic infectious period is 1.5 days38 and total incubation period is 3.4 days37, and kIS = 1/1.5 /day so that the mean infectious period after symptom onset is 1.5 days.\n\nWe estimated from the population survey data (Table S2) that the distribution of the symptomatic period can be approximated by a gamma distribution with a mean of 5.7 days and a shape parameter of 413. Therefore, in our model, we used four states to represent the symptomatic period (IS, RS1, RS2, and RS3), and we set kS = 3/4.2 /day such that the mean duration that an individual is in the RS1, RS2 or RS3 state is 4.2 days and thus the mean symptomatic period is 4.2 + 1.5 = 5.7 days. We also set 2/kA = 1/kIP + 1/kIS such that the mean infectious period of the asymptomatically infected is assumed the same as symptomatically infected. Parameter values are summarized in Table S3.\n\nOur model contained six free parameters: the transmission rate during each of the three periods (βi), the fraction of infected individuals who eventually develop symptoms (f), an initial number of exposed individuals in mid-Oct. (E0), and an overdispersion parameter for the count data (ϕ), which were assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution.\n\nFor the initial condition of the ODE system, we assumed an entirely susceptible population except for E1 = E2 ≡ E0 on Oct. 22, one week before the beginning of the case count data we fit. This is consistent with very little pre-existing immunity through either prior natural infection (<1% of the population had ever been infected by this time34) or vaccination (Fig. S2). The model was fit using Bayesian inference and implemented in the Stan programming language39. We set the prior distribution of each βi to be normal with mean 3 and standard deviation 2, the prior on f to be uniform between 0 and 1, the prior on E0 to be uniform between 1 and ten times the number of cases on the first day of data, and the prior on ϕ−1 to be exponential with mean 5. These are weak priors, and the posterior estimates (shown in Fig. S1) were not sensitive to them.\n\nThe growth rate, r, during the exponential growth period of the outbreak was calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix of the ODE system, Eq. 1, assuming the population is fully susceptible (i.e., S = N).\n\nCalculation of the reproductive number during exponential growth, R exp\n\nWe used the growth rates, r, of SARS-CoV-2 in China estimated in this study and the distribution of the intrinsic generation interval to calculate the reproductive number Rexp. This is the estimated instantaneous reproductive number during the exponential growth phase of the outbreak after Dec. 8 and before the peak. According to Abbott et al.16, the distribution of the generation interval has a mean of 3.3 days and a shape parameter close to 3. Rexp is then calculated using the formula provided in Park et al.40:\n\n$${R}_{exp}=\\frac{1}{\\int\\,g(\\tau )\\exp (-r\\tau )d\\tau }$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere g is the density function of the intrinsic generation interval distribution.\n\nRegression to estimate exponential growth rates\n\nThe rates of exponential growth in Sichuan province during Dec. 2022 were estimated by fitting a linear regression model to the fractions of COVID-19-positive individuals or individuals whose symptoms began between Dec. 2 and Dec. 9. The Dec. 1 data point was ignored because it is likely to include individuals who tested positive or started to have symptoms before Dec. 1. The fitting was performed using the lm() function in the R programming environment41.\n\nWe estimated the rate of exponential growth using the official case count data by fitting a generalized negative binomial regression to the case count time series. Fitting was performed with the glm.nb() function in the R programming environment41.\n\nEstimating population immunity against Omicron infection\n\nLau et al.15 estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the CoronaVac vaccine against Omicron infection: 7 days following immunization, the VE for the second and third doses were 5% (0–27%) and 30% (1–66%), respectively, and then the VE reduced exponentially to 1% (0–11%) and 6% (0–29%), respectively, 100 days after immunization. We used these values in our calculation, assuming that all the vaccines administered in China follow the same VE characteristics as CoronaVac. We then collected data on the fractions of people who already received two doses or three doses of vaccine over time from ref. 14 (Fig. S2a). From this dataset, we estimated the fractions of people newly vaccinated with their second or third dose over the entire period of consideration. Note that the fourth dose of vaccine was not authorized in China until mid-Dec. 2022, and therefore we did not include the fourth dose in our calculation.\n\nWe calculated the population immunity against Omicron on day d, P(d), as\n\n$$P(d)=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i={d}_{0}}^{d}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=2}^{3}{G}_{j}(d-i){Q}_{j}(i)$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Qj(i) is the fraction newly vaccinated with the second or the third dose (j = 2 or 3, respectively) on day i, and Gj(d − i) is the VE on day d given an individual received the second or the third dose (j = 2 or 3, respectively) on day i. The expected and upper bound estimates (Fig. S2b) were made using the expected and upper bound estimates of the VE.\n\nRobustness of conclusions to existence of population structure\n\nWe considered the impact of population structure on the main conclusions of our model. If population structure exists such that people who have high contact rates (and thus potentially more exposure to infection) are also more likely to be represented in the data, our results could over-state the total number of infected people by failing to recognize subpopulations that remain uninfected because of their lower contact rates. For example, people who live in urban areas with good internet access and health care facilities may be more likely to be included in the COVID-19 testing and online survey, while also experiencing more opportunity for infection; whereas people living in rural areas (far away from testing facilities and with poor internet connections) may not be included in the COVID-19 testing and online survey. Another example is that people in younger age groups may have larger numbers of contacts and be more likely to participate in online surveys than people in older age groups.\n\nTo capture this effect as simply as possible, we included two subpopulations: one with high contact rates and the other with low contact rates, with an even lower rate of contact between the two subpopulations. Specifically, we assumed that during each time period, the transmission rate in the low-contact subpopulation was half that of the high-contact subpopulation, and the transmission rate between subpopulations was one-tenth as large. We also assumed that the official case counts and the Dec. 26 survey data were taken from the population with higher contact rates (the sampled population) and the population with lower contact rates (the unsampled population) was not represented in the datasets. The full model structure is provided in Fig. S6.\n\nWe first partitioned the entire country’s population to be 65% in the high-contact subpopulation and 35% in the low-contact subpopulation. This partition is motivated by the nationwide urban–rural proportion. Because the Dec. 26 survey includes participants from both urban and rural areas, this division represents an overestimate of the size of the unsampled population. Indeed, the majority of population in China has good internet access (through cell phones) and access to COVID-testing sites. Therefore we additionally considered a model where the population is partitioned to be 80% in the high-contact subpopulation and 20% in the low-contact subpopulation, which is probably more appropriate with respect to the survey data. We fit both models to the official case count data and the Dec. 26 survey data as in the main text. Irrespective of the partition, our results from this model were consistent with our main findings. For the 80%–20% and 65%–35% partitions, respectively, we found an epidemic peak on Dec. 23 or Dec. 24, and only 2.6% or 6.7% of the entire population remaining susceptible by the end of December (Fig. S7ab).\n\nWe further tested a scenario where the partition is 80% and 20% for the sampled and unsampled subpopulations, respectively, and transmission between the subpopulations was only one-hundredth of the transmission rate within the sampled subpopulation. Note that this is an extreme and unlikely scenario where the two subpopulations were not well connected at all. We found that infection in the low-contact subpopulation lagged behind the high-contact subpopulation even more than in the previous scenarios, as expected (Fig. S7c). The amount of the entire population remaining susceptible by the end of Dec. increased slightly to 10.9%, and the epidemic peak remained on Dec. 23.\n\nModel adjustment for testing intensity and willingness in the China CDC data\n\nWe compared the fitted model trajectory against the China CDC data to validate our model estimations. For this, we multiplied the total cases predicted by the model by a factor to correct for testing effort and the willingness to get tested. We defined\n\n$$T=C\\frac{{n}_{T}/{p}_{T}}{(N-R)v},$$\n\n(4)\n\nwhere T is the model-adjusted inferred number of positive tests (plotted as colored bands in Fig. 3), C is the total number of model-predicted cases (gray band in Fig. 3), nT is the number of positive tests, pT is the test positivity rate, N is the total country population size, R is the number of individuals in the recovered non-symptomatic model states (RS + RA), and v is an unknown factor related to the proportion of the population that engages in voluntary testing. The term (N − R)v reflects that not all individuals engage in the testing and among those who engage, individuals who know they are recovered likely do not get tested or self-test any more. Values of all the quantities in Eq. (4) are known for each day—from the model fit or the reported data—except for v. We estimated a single value of v (across all days) for each testing type by least-squares fitting, using Eq. (4), obtaining v = 0.44 for the PCR tests and v = 0.52 for the antigen tests.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00554-0', 'Headline': '‘COVID zero’ regions struggle with vaccine complacency - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Nowhere is this more apparent than in Hong Kong.

With a population of 1.41 billion, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by ...', 'Full_text': 'It is challenging to strike a balance between epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. Each country and city may have its own unique circumstances that require additional considerations and adaptations [1]. China has a population of 1.41 billion. Due to this huge population base, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a scientific, gradual, and cautious approach. Preparations for the epidemic and changes in the external environment have created conditions for the reopening [2], including the evolvement of the external environment, gradual formation of the COVID-19 immune barrier, the increased awareness of virus prevention, the advancement in COVID-19 treatment, lower virulence of the Omicron variant [3], and the decreased severe COVID-19 rate and mortality rate [4].\n\nExpansion of healthcare capacity\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the reopening policy, mainly in the following aspects: First, to prepare for potential risks of medical resource overloading associated with the reopening, in the past 3 years, the National Health Commission of China has taken measures to expand healthcare capacity and make progress in treating COVID-19. Common fever clinics have been opened and critical care beds have been expanded to alleviate medical overloading. Medical institutions across the country have strengthened their respiratory infectious disease prevention and control capabilities, with increased medical beds and equipment, as well as improved medical rescue abilities. Moreover, China’s medical grading diagnosis and treatment system plays an important role in meeting the needs of patients and effectively operating the primary medical system. Antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been included in medical insurance through fast-approval channels, and maximum efforts are being made to provide drugs to patients in need. The government and health departments at all levels are providing human, financial, and material support to primary medical institutions to help establish an effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment mode.\n\nDuring the reopening period, China focused on enhancing the ability to treat severe COVID-19 cases, improving the efficiency of transferring severe cases, and preventing mild cases from becoming severe. The collective efforts of the public governance system helped to meet medical needs and navigate the peak of infections.\n\nVaccination program\n\nSecond, SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China [5]. With the widespread promotion and the national free vaccination policy, by early November 2022, over 90% of the total population had completed the full course of the new coronavirus vaccine. Research conducted by the National Major Scientific and Technological Infrastructure for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center showed that among infected individuals aged 60 or older who received two to three doses of the inactivated coronavirus vaccine, the rate of severe illness protection reached 90.15% [6]. The rate of severe illness protection for all infected individuals was reported to be 96.02%. Data released by a research team from the University of Hong Kong also supported the efficacy of domestically produced inactivated vaccines in preventing severe illness and death [7].\n\nEpidemic prevention and control mechanism\n\nThird, over the past 3 years, China has improved its epidemic prevention and control mechanism for COVID-19. The “State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism” was established as a multidepartment coordination platform to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. Through this mechanism, many local outbreaks have been successfully controlled, and guidelines have been developed by the National Health Commission and experts in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, medical treatment, and public health policy. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infection” has been updated ten times to provide up-to-date strategies and recommendations.\n\nWeakened viral virulence\n\nLast but not the least, the variant of SARS-CoV‑2 is accompanied by variable characteristics of the clinical picture, with disease severity appearing to be lower with the Omicron variant [8]. Some scientists warned that this does not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed less virulence than previous variants of concern and lung function was less compromised [9]. There is growing evidence to suggest that, with the protection of vaccines and improved treatment conditions, the harm of COVID-19 to the population has significantly decreased over time [10].\n\nThese are just some of the prerequisites for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus is highly contagious, and the short-term surge in confirmed cases is an undoubtful challenge faced by medical institutions after the reopening. The 3‑year period of hard and effective epidemic prevention and control in China has won valuable time and experience for the comprehensive opening up of the country. It seems that the threat of the virus to the population has become more manageable; thus, ending the dynamic zero-COVID policy and reopening the country supports economic recovery and international cooperation. In 2022, Omicron became the dominant strain in China, with a weakened pathogenicity resulting in mostly mild symptoms and a small proportion of severe cases. With high vaccination rates and effective epidemic control measures, the focus shifted from “dynamic clearance” to “protecting vulnerable populations.” On January 7, 2023, the State Council issued the 10th edition of the prevention and control plan, which emphasized vaccination and personal protection, optimized testing strategies, and outlined emergency measures during the epidemic.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-45934-2', 'Headline': 'The unseen toll: excess mortality during covid-19 lockdowns - Nature', 'Snippet': 'We find that the average effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown in Sweden in our period of analysis, is 33.2 deaths/100,000 inhabitants.

We use (accumulated) weekly excess mortality which are based on the 5 year average death count model, i.e., starting from the first week of November 2019 we compute the difference between weekly deaths and the average number deaths in the previous 5 years in the same week, accumulated at each subsequent week.\n\nRecent work on the viability of different model specifications for estimating excess deaths14 finds that, out of 9 different estimation methods considered, a 5 year average death count model has the strongest upward bias of excess, while a 5 year average death rate model has the strongest downward bias of excess. Accordingly, it is suggested that studies using excess death as an outcome ought to test for effects using estimates of excess deaths from both these models. If effects exist using the outcomes derived by both models, they are likely to be robust against bias introduced due to the excess death estimation approach chosen. While the death rate model adjusts for increasing deaths due to population aging, both models do not adjust for decreasing deaths due to mortality improvements14. Previous work has shown that when accounting for improved life expectancy, post-pandemic excess mortality in Sweden is higher16, thus our findings are likely to be a conservative estimate of the effect of not locking down.\n\nThe idea behind SCM is to construct a counterfactual version of Sweden (synthetic Sweden) as a weighted average of the outcome of the control units (in our case all the other countries in the STMF data for which we observe deaths and death rates from November 2014 to the end of 2020). The weights are chosen such that the distance between the observed characteristic of the treated unit and the control unit is minimized in the pre-treatment period. If the chosen weights make the pre-treatment trends of the outcome of the treated and the synthetic control overlap, under the assumption that this overlap would have continued in the treatment period in the absence of the treatment, we can use the synthetic control to estimate what would have happened to the treated unit had not it received the treatment. By using SCM, we ensure that our synthetic control unit (Synthetic Sweden) evolved in a comparable way to our treatment unit (Sweden) before the implementation of mandatory lockdown measures and therefore we can control for all confounders (including time varying confounders) which depend on pre-treatment differences. As a robustness check, we also estimate the effect of not implementing a strict lockdown in Sweden by the augmented synthetic control method12, which allows for negative weights and better pre-treament fit, and by the synthetic difference-in-differences (Synth-DiD)13, which construct weights for pre-intervention periods as well as for each unit in the donor pool. The advantage of Synth-DiD is that it allows to account not only time varying pre-treatment confounders as SCM but also for unit specific time invariant confounders as the standard DiD, combining the strengths of the two methods. For each outcome considered, we optimise the weights separately.\n\nIn Sweden, the number of infections surpassed a threshold of one infection per one million inhabitants on the 29th of February, 2020. The timing at which countries implemented a mandatory lockdown varies between 13 to 24 days from this threshold. As the treatment is not implementing a mandatory lockdown, a hypothetical treatment start date has to be chosen. For our main specification, we provide a conservative estimate choosing a slow response (4 weeks), and provide an alternative scenario for a rapid response (2 weeks) as a robustness check.\n\nSynthetic Sweden is constructed based using the weeks leading up to the start date which is Week 1 (1st week of November, 2019) to Week 22 (4th week of March, 2020) for our main specification. Our donor pool consist of 29 countries: Austria; Belgium; Bulgaria; Canada; Switzerland; Czechia; Denmark; Germany; Spain; Estonia; Finland; France; Croatia; Hungary; Iceland; Israel; South Korea; Italy; Luxembourg; Lithuania; Latvia; Netherlands; Norway; New Zealand; Poland; Portugal; Russia; Slovenia; and Slovakia.\n\nFor our main outcome of weekly excess deaths/100,000, the weights received by each country which contribute (at least 1%) to construct synthetic Sweden are: 12.3% Belgium; 19.6% Denmark; 3.8% Finland; 17.5% Lithuania; 29.6% Norway; and 17% New Zealand (the remaining 0.2% weights are assigned to the other countries in the donor pool). For our secondary outcome of weekly excess rate, the weights received by each country which contribute (at least 1%) to construct synthetic Sweden are: 52.4% Norway; 36.5% Lithuania; 4.8% Latvia; and 6.1% New Zealand (the remaining 0.2% weights are assigned to the other countries in the donor pool). Synthetic Sweden is assumed to have a lockdown lasting approximately 10 weeks, which is the average period for which the 6 donor countries imposed the mandatory lockdown. Section “Leave-one-out results” shows that the results are robust to alternative donor compositions.\n\nTable 1 reports descriptive statistics and weight of the predictors used to construct synthetic Sweden. Pre-treatment values of the outcomes contribute the most when constructing the weights, while other control variables contribute less to the construction of synthetic Sweden. Deaths due to cardiovascular disease and population density are lower in Sweden as compared to synthetic Sweden. However these variables also receive low weights and at worst would likely bias our results towards zero. Due to the difficulty to construct credible measures of climate that capture variation at the country level, especially for countries with vast territories such as Sweden, we are not able to credibly control for climate. Using the World Bank data catalog that measure average monthly temperature in each country in the period 1961-1999, we find that on average Sweden is colder than Synthetic Sweden. This indicates that controlling for climate would make our estimates even larger.\n\nPanels a and b in Fig. 1 show the results of our preferred conservative estimate of a slow response (4 weeks). We find that the average effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown in Sweden in our period of analysis, is 33.2 deaths/100,000 inhabitants. This translates to approximately 3420 deaths in Sweden that may have been avoided, had Sweden imposed a mandatory lockdown by Week 22, ie. towards the end of March, 2020. While Sweden and synthetic Sweden start to diverge immediately, we find that the divergence peaks towards the end of June (Week 35) with a size of 42.82 deaths/100,000 inhabitants which translates to approximately 4411 deaths. Further, we compute the SCM estimates separately by sex and find peak effect sizes of 16.68 deaths/100,000 inhabitants for females and 22.49 deaths/100,000 inhabitants for males which is consistent with the documented sex-differences in Covid-19 deaths.\n\nIt is well documented that Covid-19 disproportionately affected the elderly, particularly in the case of Sweden where Covid-19 mortality in long-term care facilities were reportedly much higher than its neighbours, 5 fold higher than in Denmark and 11 fold higher than in Norway and Finland17. We explore if our results corroborate this by examining cumulative excess deaths by heterogeneous age groups of inhabitants who are 65+ years of age and inhabitants who are below 65 years of age in panels c and d in Fig. 1. The results suggest that our main results are almost fully driven by excess deaths in the 65+ age group, in support of the evidence that ’dry-tinder’(Referring to a hypothetical stock of individuals who are at risk of dying soon18) does not account for the level of excess recorded in Sweden18.\n\nRapid response\n\nPanels e and f in Fig. 1 consider a rapid response (2 weeks), such that the hypothetical treatment starts in Week 20, for cumulative death counts and cumulative death rates respectively. Our results are not sensitive to the response time chosen.\n\nPre-treatment fit\n\nThe synthetic counterfactual for Sweden closely follows the trend of cumulative excess mortality in Sweden in the weeks leading up to the pandemic as shown in all panels in Figs. 1 and 2. The drop in excess deaths between week 10 and 20 is explained by lower mortality, especially compared to February 2018 which saw significant influenza related excess deaths in Sweden19. Extending the pre-treatment period even further by including data from previous years is not possible, as this would have severely limited our donor pool as some countries do not report weekly mortality data in the STMF-dataset for previous years. A further restriction in this regards is that excess mortality is constructed using a 5 year average approach, therefore requiring data not only for the pre-treatment period, but also 5 years prior (2014–2020). Reassuringly, our results are similar when using the augmented SCM, in Sect. “Augmented synthetic control method”, which indicates that the pre-treatment fit in our main specification is good.\n\nPlacebo tests\n\nPanels a and b in Fig. 2 present the results of placebo test in space for the outcomes of excess death counts and excess death rate respectively. The placebo tests are obtained by iteratively applying the SCM to each unit in the donor pool to obtain a distribution of placebo effects. This allows us to infer whether the effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown in Sweden is extreme when compared to the donor pool’s placebo effects. The figures clearly show that if any of the countries in the donor pool had not implemented a mandatory lockdown, we would seldom find an effect as extreme as that found in Sweden. This shows that our estimated impact of not implementing a mandatory lockdown in Sweden is not likely to be observed by chance, and is clearly driven by the treatment in question.\n\nLeave-one-out results\n\nPanels c and d in Fig. 2 graphs the two models for the cumulative excess deaths and excess death rate respectively, where step-wise one of the 6 donors is left out. The leave-one-out analysis reveals that the overall findings are independent of individual donor countries with the overall development of cumulative excess deaths in all leave-one-out counterfactual models behaving with rather similar trends. However, they also reveal that for the later part of 2020 (around week 35), marking the onset of what most countries referred to as “the second wave”, the findings do not appear to be clearly independent of individual donors any longer, in particular when examining the excess death rate.\n\nAugmented synthetic control method\n\nA prerequisite for SCM to be valid is that the pre-treatment outcomes for Sweden closely match the pre-treatment outcomes of synthetic Sweden. As an additional check, we use augmented SCM12, which includes a ridge regression predicting post-treatment outcomes among control units, with pre-treatment outcomes and covariates as predictors. Panels a and b in Fig. 3 present the results of augmented SCM on weekly excess deaths and weekly excess death rates respectively. The graphs plot the week-by-week point estimates along with 95% confidence intervals, calculated using the novel jackknife+ method20. The confidence intervals are quite small and show a significant positive effect in the entire post-treatment period for both outcomes (see Panels a and b in Fig. 3). The average effect size, for the weeks we examine, is 30.04 deaths/100,000 inhabitants. This is similar to our estimate using the SCM, which indicates that the estimated bias is small and that the pre-treatment fit in our main specification is adequate.\n\nSynthetic difference-in-difference\n\nWe ensure our results are robust to using the very recent advances in the SCM literature, the synthetic difference-in-difference (Synth-DiD) method21 which combines the strengths of SCM and difference-in-difference. Synth-DiD introduces weighting for both, cross-sectional units and pre-treatment time periods in the construction of synthetic Sweden, thereby improving on the precision and reliability of the estimator. Similar to SCM, it ensures that pre-treatment trends are matched somehow weakening parallel trend type assumptions typically imposed by DiD methods. Moreover, Synth-DiD, as DiD, allows for the presence of time invariant confounders. Panels c and d in Fig. 3 graph the results of this estimation for the accumulated weekly excess deaths and excess death rates respectively. The shadowed red areas under each pre-treament period represenent the weights that synth-DiD give to each period. For both outcomes the last pre-treatment week receive most of the weight. This is not surprising given that the SCM already achieved a good pre-intervention fit. The difference between the solid red line and the solid green line is the estimated average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) which is 30.06 deaths/100,000 inhabitants with a 95% CI [4.89, 55.24], this confidence interval is obtained using the method described in21. The effect is graphically illustrated by the black arrow. The dotted black line represent what would have happened had Sweden imposed a mandatory lockdown under the standard parallel trend assumption adjusting for pre-treatment trends by the synthetic control weighting. The Synth-DiD estimator approximates that 3096 excess deaths could have been avoided, had Sweden implemented a mandatory lockdown. Figure 3 also includes a placebo test which estimate the of a fake intervention that would have occurred at week 10, placebo synth-DiD Sweden is represented by the blue line. The treatment effect of the placebo intervention is very close to zero for both outcomes as shown in both panel c and d.\n\nWhat is the magnitude of the effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown?\n\nWith regards to the magnitude of the effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown, previous studies have found that implementing a lockdown in Sweden could have resulted in a 34% (by May 17th9) to upto 47% (by June 30th11) reduction in Covid-19 specific deaths. Our estimates are not directly comparable to these as we use measures of excess deaths as outcomes, as opposed to Covid-19 specific deaths. We find a conservative effect size of approximately 30 deaths/100,000 inhabitants in Sweden as compared to synthetic Sweden. This result is slightly higher than10, who finds that upto 25% of excess deaths could have been avoided by the week ending June 13th. Our findings also corroborate that of10 in that the divergence peaks towards the end of June. The magnitude of this effect remains fairly robust irrespective of the estimation method used.\n\nIs there a delay in the effect of the lockdown?\n\nWe find that Sweden and synthetic Sweden begin to diverge from end of March (Week 22) onward. This is in contrast to early studies9,10 that find a 3–5 week delay in the effect of the lockdown on Covid-19 infections which could be an artifact of idiosyncratic testing rates, specifically the extremely slow testing rate in Sweden during the initial phase of the pandemic. Our results are comparable to more recent studies using Covid-19 deaths as outcomes11, where effects are seen within a week after the introduction of lockdown in synthetic Sweden.\n\nDid Swedes reduce their mobility despite the lack of a mandatory lockdown?\n\nWe use Google mobility data to compare actual behavioural adjustments between Sweden and synthetic Sweden. Figure 3 presents the Google mobility trends for both, places of work (e) and residential areas (f) for Sweden (solid line) and for our previously constructed counterfactual synthetic Sweden (dotted line). Previous studies suggest a correlation between Covid-19 restrictions and mobility22. In comparison to the baseline (first 5 weeks of 2020), it becomes clear that during the first wave of the pandemic (March–June) Swedes spent substantially less time at their workplace (e) and instead spent more time in their residences (f). However, during this first period these changes are substantially smaller than what is observed for the earlier constructed synthetic Sweden. These results are consistent with previous work that show that Sweden only reduced its mobility by approximately half of that of its Nordic neighbours23, indicating a more limited behavioural adjustment due to the lack of regulations being enforced as mandatory. During the later half of 2020 reduced adherence and eased restrictions lead to a normalisation of mobility patterns in many countries24 with Sweden being an apparent exception, first drastically reducing workplace mobility around week 36. While mobility data is a direct measure of a certain type of individual behavioural adjustments, it is not the only one that might be relevant. Other studies25 have highlighted the potential effect of related behaviour adjustments, such as physical separation at the workplace—however, these more detailed individual behavioural adjustments and their potential impact on infection dynamics are outside the scope of this study.\n\nCan differences in healthcare capacities explain observed excess mortality?\n\nIn a 2018 study measuring healthcare access and quality performance, Sweden, unsurprisingly, scored among the leading countries in the World26 with very few cases of amenable mortality–deaths from causes that should be avoidable. A later comparison of healthcare capacity27 during the early COVID-19 pandemic found that, among the countries studied, Sweden had the lowest capacity of ICU and acute care beds going into the pandemic. The study also finds that Sweden had been able to more than double its capacity during the pandemic. To ensure our results are not driven by differences in healthcare capacity, we included two indicators of healthcare capacity (physicians and hospital beds) as controls in our analysis. Our results remain robust to this inclusion such that these controls receive almost no weight in the construction of synthetic Sweden, suggesting that Sweden’s ability to drastically increase healthcare capacity during the pandemic acts as a moderating factor. The overall composition of synthetic Sweden as countries with similarly excellent healthcare systems and thereby also similar pre-pandemic mortality patterns points towards the fact that such pre-existing trends are successfully controlled for and therefor does not explain the observed excess mortality for Sweden.\n\nExcess mortality is defined as the difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods. For excess mortality, we use the Human Mortality Databases’ STMF data series. These provide data on all-cause mortality fluctuations by week, sex and aggregated age group within each calendar year. There are several advantages of using excess deaths over data on infections or covid specific deaths to evaluate the overall impact of covid and the effectiveness of associated lockdown measures. First, data on infections are likely to suffer from measurement error due to missing data on number of tests, imperfection of accuracy of tests and sample selection in that not all covid positive individuals will get tested. Second, data on deaths due to covid is likely to be an underestimate as covid may not always be diagnosed, especially in the earlier months of the pandemic and because of heterogeneous testing policies across countries. Data on excess deaths do not suffer from measurement error arising from these dimensions. Therefore to the extent that the excess mortality has been accurately predicted, these are likely to provide a more accurate picture of the effect of Covid-19 and associated lockdown measures. Our outcomes are 5 year average death counts, and death rates calculated using the Lee-Carter model28. Data on control variables were retrieved from the Worldbank (GDP per capita 2020 & Life expectancy 2019) or Our World in Data (Age-standardized death rate cardiovascular 2019, Urbanization 2020 & Population density 2020). To control for life expectancy and age-standardized death rate by cardiovascular disease we utilized 2019 instead of 2020 data as these could be strongly affected by the pandemic itself.\n\nWe restrict our analysis to the end of September for four reasons. First, the end of September marked a return of Swedes to workplaces, as compared to synthetic Sweden shown by our analysis of Google mobility reports in Fig. 3. Second, there were significant and considerable policy changes in Sweden by October, 2020, with regards to restrictions. On the 20th of October, Uppsala became the first region to introduce local restrictions and stricter recommendations for workplaces (everyone who can work from home should do so), shops and sports facilities. People were urged to avoid public transport and contact with others who are not members of the same household. While no legal sanctions introduced, these were no longer optional restrictions. Several other regions followed suit, such that within one month, by the 19th of November, 20 out of the 21 regions of Sweden had such local restrictions and recommendations in place. Third, by the 6th of November, the difference between Sweden and Norway, the largest contributor to synthetic Sweden, with regards to their Health and Containment Index (Calculated on the basis of the following thirteen metrics: school closures; workplace closures; cancellation of public events; restrictions on public gatherings; closures of public transport; stay-at-home requirements; public information campaigns; restrictions on internal movements; international travel controls; testing policy; extent of contact tracing; face coverings; and vaccine policy.) was less pronounced29. Thus, by November, synthetic Sweden is no longer an appropriate counterfactual for Sweden due to policy changes in the donor countries. We do not attempt a region based SCM analysis as done in other contexts30,31 due to low numbers in excess mortality when disaggregated into regions. Finally, yet importantly, it has been shown that estimates for excess mortality, irrespective of the specific method of estimation, struggle to accurately predict mortality patterns especially during influenza season (usually Fall / Winter)14, providing yet another reason why we decided to restrict our analysis to the end of September.\n\nSignificance statement\n\nThis paper estimates the causal effect of not implementing a lockdown in Sweden on excess deaths. We find that by the end of September, 2020, approximately 10% of all deaths in Sweden could have been avoided, had Sweden implemented a mandatory lockdown. We also find that the effect of not implementing a lockdown on excess mortality was seen in the weeks immediately following, which is in contrast to the existing evidence that examines Covid-19 infections as outcomes. By examining excess deaths attributed to all causes, we provide a comprehensive estimate of the effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown, by accounting for all deaths caused and prevented by disruptions due to the pandemic.(Supplementary information 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6238126/china-zero-covid-policy-global-health/', 'Headline': 'What China’s Zero-COVID Policy Means For Global Health | TIME', 'Snippet': 'China’s zero-COVID strategy is an extension of the drastic measures instituted, not only in that country but in others around the world, including the U.S., during the early days of the pandemic ...', 'Full_text': 'Protests in multiple Chinese cities over the strict COVID-19 policies enforced by China’s government reflect the growing sentiment of people around the world. We’re tired of the pandemic, and tired of the myriad ways the SARS-CoV-2 virus has changed our lives forever. But the demonstrations in China also reflect a more specific, local frustration with a strategy for controlling the virus that every other country in the world has long since left behind.\n\nChina’s zero-COVID strategy is an extension of the drastic measures instituted, not only in that country but in others around the world, including the U.S., during the early days of the pandemic in an effort to quash the virus as quickly as possible. That made sense at the beginning when people had no immunity to the virus, and there were no vaccines or treatments to fight it. In fact, instituting lockdowns and keeping people from mingling are among the public health pillars of controlling an infectious disease. “Employing quarantine, isolation, and testing are all core public health strategies that we use in all sorts of outbreaks,” says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “And they remain viable. But they don’t always infringe on basic freedoms and rights in the same way we have seen in China. Clearly in this instance, they have become very extensive.”\n\nChina’s strategy has been to test people regularly before they leave their residences, or enter public facilities, and when anyone tests positive, to immediately quarantine the facility where the case arose, even if it means preventing people from returning home from work or from a daytrip Disneyland. From there, people who test positive are transferred to isolation facilities where they remain until they produce negative tests before they are allowed to return home.\n\nBut while chasing after the virus in this way can limit its spread, such stalking can only go so far. Ultimately, the virus escapes, and new infections are seeded. In SARS-CoV-2’s case, that likelihood is increased by the fact that the virus also lives in animal hosts where it continues to thrive, and mutate, waiting for opportunities to infect vulnerable human hosts with little defensive immunity against it. “It’s difficult to envision how a zero-COVID policy would eradicate this virus,” says Dr. Ian Lipkin, director of the center for infection and immunity at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. “Even if you exclude all human beings from being hosts, there are still animal reservoirs capable of carrying the virus, and reintroducing it into human populations.”\n\nWhile other countries, including Australia, the U.K., and the U.S. instituted a quarantine system similar to China’s in the early days of the pandemic, health officials there always acknowledged it would be a temporary solution, until the population’s immunity could be bolstered, both from exposure to natural infections and ultimately by vaccines.\n\nFor China, however, the strategy has been inflexible, and without a clearly defined exit strategy—largely because of how tightly intertwined it is with the authority and stature of the ruling Chinese Communist Party. “Politically, the pandemic response has been framed as a competition between two political systems, and Xi Jinping used China’s early success to showcase the superiority of the Chinese political system,” says Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, and professor of global governance and health issues in Asia at Seton Hall University. “”Theoretically, if they are able to sustain a low level of infection after other countries have moved away from zero COVID policies, they could claim they are the only winners in the fight. So the high political stakes also contributed to China keeping these policies.”\n\nMeanwhile, for the rest of the world, when effective vaccines became available at the end of 2020, a zero-tolerance strategy quickly became obsolete. As a population’s protection against the virus mounts due to immunizations, then confining infected people and trying to shut down large regions becomes no longer necessary. That’s the approach that Australia took, after a zero-COVID policy at the beginning of the pandemic. But, says Rivers, the difference was that Australia set a limit to the strict lockdowns, promising to lift them when 80% of the population had been vaccinated and therefore were better protected against severe disease. “There needs to be an exit strategy,” she says. “Australia clearly defined that strategy to keep the public on board and understand what the path forward was. It was also important to make sure the country didn’t get stuck in an unsustainable place.”\n\nChina may be in such a situation, with no clearly articulated end to its current policy.\n\nThe threats to global public health posed by China’s policy\n\nKeeping people isolated does give the virus fewer opportunities to spread and infect locally, but in a worldwide pandemic, that may not be the most desirable end result. People who are inadequately vaccinated, or who haven’t had much exposure to natural infection with the virus, fail to generate strong T-cell responses, which scientists believe is important for longer-lasting protection against serious COVID-19 disease. Much of the rest of the world has been building this T-cell defense, due to a combination of vaccination, boosting, and exposure to and infection with COVID-19. China’s population may still be in the nascent stages of amassing this type of protection. “Basically they have a population that is inadequately protected by either earlier infection or vaccination, who are now at risk for spread of the virus,” says Lipkin.\n\nContributing to that is the fact that studies show that the vaccines taken by the majority of China’s population, made in-country by two local companies, Sinovac and Sinopharm, haven’t provided as much protection against infection or severe disease as those produced in the U.S. and Europe. Those vaccines use inactivated forms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to stimulate the immune system, while other approaches have utilized new mRNA or viral vector technologies. That means that China’s population, although it may be immunized, may not be as protected as they could be. Indeed, Lipkin says that were China to deploy vaccines like the mRNA shot from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, or the viral vector vaccines from AstraZeneca, as booster shots, it could improve the protection begun by the inactivated virus vaccines the Chinese have used to date. Chinese scientists have been working on these other types of vaccines, including mRNA shots, but the health leadership has not yet endorsed these for widespread use in the country.\n\nThen there is the human and economic toll of quarantining people, cutting them off from and disrupting their social, professional, and cultural connections. The result has been that pent up frustrations have erupted into protests against not just the restrictive COVID-19 policies, but the entire communist system in recent weeks, in a stunning and rapidly spreading movement. “I think the Party was caught off guard when they were seeing protests in multiple cities,” says Huang.\n\nHow to take the next step forward\n\nHealth experts agree that the path out of zero-COVID is to accelerate vaccination of the population, which Chinese leadership has been attempting to execute in recent weeks. Party officials are fighting a problem of their own making, however, as many elderly members of the population have not been immunized because they don’t feel the urgency in a country where cases had been relatively low given the strict lockdowns. In a report released on Nov. 28, government health officials in China said 65.8% of people over age 80 years had received a booster dose. That’s an increase from the 40% reported in the middle of the month—but still far too low.\n\nEven if more people are boosted, given the waning protection provided by those shots, especially against newer Omicron variants, such boosters may not be enough to bolster the population’s immunity to levels that would justify phasing out the zero COVID policy. As long as the virus is able to produce more copies of itself, it will continue to evolve and generate new mutations, some of which could become variants that spread more quickly or cause more severe disease. The roulette wheel of viral mutations continues to spin, and the best defense to slow it down is through immunity—either from vaccinations or bouts of infections.\n\n“China has a population with very little infection-acquired immunity. And the vaccine acquired immunity has not held up well over time against new variants,” says Rivers. “So we expect a population that is largely susceptible. And those are conditions for large waves of infections. From a public health perspective, I would expect widespread vaccination and boosting of older people. But that is as much a political question as a public health one.”'}}",100.0,1

The community is comprised of millennials, Gen X’s, and Baby Boomers, consisting of professionals, entrepreneurs, laborers and retirees.\n\nThe diversity of South Shore’s population makes it an ideal location for families, individuals and businesses.\n\nAnother unique, yet troubling aspect of this community is that each year $200 million in resident spending leaves the South Shore area. This revenue leakage presents many possibilities for retail opportunities, and corporate involvement.\n\nThe Plan’s Economic Development section puts forth strategies to stop this leakage and create a sustainable economy for South Shore. The Housing section addresses the rental and home ownership needs and opportunities.\n\nAfter hearing what the South Shore community wants and needs, an experienced group of real estate professionals came together and formed Model Of Transformation Design & Development (M.O.T-DD) and conceptualized The XChange Project . The XChange Project addresses some of the strategies and vision of The Economic Development and Housing sections within the plan. M.O.T-DD would like to first say thank you to The South Shore Chamber of Commerce, Neighborhood Network Alliance, and South Shore Works along with the QLP committee for the outstanding work of delivering an action plan to revitalize South Shore. “Your leadership, sacrifice and vision make our job as real estate developers easy.\n\nAdditionally, we would like to thank Alderman Greg Mitchell for his support, and vision for the ward.”\n\nGerald Williams, Vice President of\n\nAcquisitions for M.O.T.DD says “We’ve\n\nalways known that the dollars were in\n\nSouth Shore anecdotally. But The QLP\n\nallows us to now speak qualitatively\n\nand quantitatively. The numbers tell the story. We are armed with data that justifies financial investment in South\n\nShore. This is an excellent time for corporations, small businesses, and new residents looking for growth to come to South Shore.”\n\nEnvisioned as a state-of-the-art commercial high rise, mixed-use real\n\nestate development with 15,000-22,000 square feet of retail space and featuring beautifully designed apartments boasting full amenities like those found downtown, west loop, and nearby Hyde Park such as a rooftop deck, bar and restaurant.\n\nM.O.T-DD is confident that this development project “promises to inspire current, and past residents, while attracting new ones. It will elevate what investment development looks like in South Shore.”\n\nWe will offer not only the finest of amenities, but also wellness features integrating design features that evoke the rich South Shore culture while ensuring sustainability.”\n\nAccording to MOT-DD. “The XChange Development Project will rise on the long vacant land that was once home to the Food Exchange Supermarket at 71st and Exchange Avenue. This state-of-the-art development promises to elevate what investment development looks like in South Shore. Powered by best-in-class technology and built with sustainability in mind, The XChange design meets the community’s demand for contemporary residential units, parking, and retail space.\n\nIt is one thing to have a perfect plan – but still another to have the perfect team to implement the plan, and the residents of South Shore have the opportunity to be blessed with both.\n\nM.O.T. Design & Development Group describe themselves as “an organically grown, dynamic team of professional s specializing in commercial and residential real estate development.”\n\nNo one knows the ins and outs of South Shore like this group of men whose unique backgrounds are rooted in boots-on-the-ground experiences in Chicago.\n\nPresident Johnny Mullins is a unique individual with a very accomplished background in commercial, and residential real estate. He has experience building high rises around the world. As the President of M.O.TDD Johnny leads the strategic investment, and operating functions throughout each part of the development process. Johnny is responsible for all the intricate details of design and development, including research, site selection, negotiations, zoning, local ordinances, bid selection, scheduling, and site management. Plus, his digital expertise modernizes and elevates the pre-construction experience, identifies and solves design challenges, and makes the best use of project time and resources.\n\n“My motivation and vision for this high-rise development, the Xchange project, is to create an inclusive community that provides a safe, affordable, and sustainable living environment to those who are underserved in the Chicago South Shore area. This project will bring together people of different backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs to foster collaboration, creativity, and innovation. We strive to empower and uplift our community while also addressing some of the most pressing concerns in the area.”\n\nGerald Williams has lived in South Shore for over 50 years. He is an active general contractor, and investor in addition to being a former appraiser, and real estate broker. His motivation is to help “transform South Shore into a world class community with beautiful real estate, businesses, and a place where we will get tremendous pride from for generations to come. In addition, the time is now for people that look like us to be the change that we want to see in our communities.\n\nWe have to save ourselves from living 2nd class lifestyles.”\n\nHe emphasizes the importance of the project, “It is important because we are losing our ability to attract younger professionals to South Shore. If you want to attract something you have to become something attractive. The XChange doesn’t bring all that is needed to complete the transformation; however, it will be catalytic. Finally, our young folks need to see and believe that we can transform our communities when we come together. We must stop waiting for others to do it for us. This is for us to do.”\n\nJemal King, who is a retired Chicago police officer of 20 years, also has a wealth of real estate experience including having rehabbed over three hundred residential and commercial properties on the south side of Chicago over the past twenty years. Jemal leads numerous multi-million dollar organizations and teaches real estate fundamentals to diverse audiences throughout the world. Jemal focuses on building relationships with res ident s , business owners, and government officials. He collects public input throughout the development life cycle to ensure all voices are heard.\n\nMark Buford is experienced in institutional and private lending. He has originated several hundreds of millions in commercial real estate transactions since 2016. As a national lending professional, Mark’s efforts have created an expansive network of real estate investors and developers throughout the country. In this role with MOT-DD, he oversees all aspects of financing, debt, and equity partner relationships. He also works closely with lenders and investors to find optimal capital structures. Mark says that “we currently have equity and debt interest but are still definitely seeking other financing options. “It’s an interesting time considering the looming recession, and interest rate environment, not to mention rising labor, and material costs.” Creative financing solutions, and strong lending partners will be needed.\n\nAttorney Damon Stewart’s primary responsibilities include drafting, interpreting, and finalizing forms and contracts, managing legal due diligence, structuring joint partnerships, and much more. Damon also currently serves as a Chicago violent crimes detective who knows firsthand the harsh realities of the streets of Chicago. His motivation is “to break barriers and save lives.” “I see The XChange project as an opportunity to accomplish something significant that will outlive me,” he says.\n\nM.O.T-DD is grateful to Allstate for accepting the call to action! “They are an example of a responsible corporate citizen who gets it,” said Mark Buford, Vice President of M.O.TDD, “Allstate showed up with an army of executive level employees and literally rolled up their sleeves helping to clean our vacant lot, and then sat down with community members, and our team for a sincere, and open dialogue brainstorming potential solutions for the South Shore community at Majani vegan restaurant.” “No promises have been made.\n\n“Buford continued, “but whether it is contributing directly to our capital stack or providing other resources that can assist with financing solutions we are grateful for the relationship, and continued dialogue with their real estate executives, and team.\n\nDamon Stewart says “It’s inspiring that a corporation the size and influence of All state is philosophically aligned to make a difference in underserved communities.\n\nWe know that we are literally “in good hands”, and that this type of initiative or effort must come from the top.” We want to thank Thomas J. Wilson, the CEO of Allstate and solicit for others to join the movement.\n\nOne of the fears of many urban communities is that of displacement once a plan of revitalization is put into action. Being of and from the community, the M.O.T. Design & Development Group recognizes this fear and firmly believes in growth without displacement as well as value without compromise. Of utmost importance to the Group is developing solutions that unveil each neighborhood’s greatest potential. This is where collaborative efforts from all stakeholders intersect: We hope to continue to work with the, Alderman and other organizations to address housing and other needs outlined within the QLP.\n\nThey further explain, “We confidently identify opportunities ahead of market trends in partnership with residents, government officials, businesses, and investors. Then we use our expertise to efficiently transform blueprints into developments that will elevate communities for generations to come.”\n\nRe-energizing communities and redefining real estate development is what they do best.\n\nMOT-DD recognizes the need for collaborative efforts when revitalizing depressed or underserved areas. “Regardless of the plan, the project must feasible, and make financial sense if it’s going to be realized. The challenges in South Shore are multilayered thus requiring the solutions to be multipronged as w e l l . Together with other stakeholders we are prepared and ready to execute our part. Our intention is to provide economic opportunities to small Black and Brown owned companies via contracts for professional services on the XChange Development Project once we’re through zoning.\n\nWho would be better to carry out XChange Development Project for the South Shore Community than this full-service real estate firm with urban market expertise. Collectively, they have years of experience in innovating, developing, building, and various property types, such as the property type that will be the nucleus of The XChange Development Project.\n\nThe proclaimed mission of M.O.T-DD\n\nis to “transform and elevate communities through commercial and residential real estate development regardless of any economic , political, social, psychological complexities or barriers.”\n\nThe groups’ individual and collective experience in urban development, as well as their unique backgrounds coming from within the communities they serve, provides them with a perspective that no group coming from the outside would have in perceiving, understanding, and dealing with the complexities and barriers, puts them in a winning position from the start. Jemal King describes the vision as “Transforming vision into value and establishing communities where new and existing residents, business owners and investors have limitless opportunities to thrive. Rooted in meaningful innovation and integrity, our development projects will bring about positive change and unleash the vitality of neighborhoods across the Chicago.”\n\nM . O .T- D D ‘s commitment to excellence, their dedication to their mission statement , their extraordinary vision, and their lived and unique first-hand experiences in South Shore and other communities work together to make them the absolute dream team for helping to implement South Shore’s Quality of Life plan through The XChange Development. Powered by best in class technology and built with sustainability in mind, The XChange Project will meet the unmet demand for high end contemporary residential units, amenities, parking, and retail space.\n\nMake no mistake, South Shore is one of Chicago’s most in-demand submarkets for investment, and M.O.T. understands that. They understand that it is a prime location, ready for investment being located on Chicago’s lakefront, and sitting two neighborhoods over from the Obama Presidential Center that is under construction in Hyde Park. M.O.T.DD understands that.\n\nThey understand that residents want quality, exclusivity, amenities, and safety features such as door attendants and covered parking, with rental market data showing a substantial quantity of renovated vintage product that is priced at a premium.\n\nThey understand that there is an unmet demand for contemporary apartment products along the lakefront, which is a result of little to no residential or multi-family construction in South Shore over many years.\n\nThey understand that today’s renter\n\ndesires uniqueness and quality, and\n\nthey desire designs that will feature\n\nthe most efficient use of their space and value for their dollar. Thus, the property will offer a mixture of one, two, and three-bedroom units, with the three bedrooms perhaps on the top floors.\n\nThe XChange will offer all the most in demand amenities a contemporary building would have, such as fitness gym/fitness spa; resident lounge, entertainment room; cinema room; chef’s kitchen; resident library; resident co-working space; dog wash; swimming pool; pool deck with BBQ grills and cabanas; trash and recycling chutes on each floor; designated storage units; 24-hour doorperson/concierge; laundry and dry-cleaning pick-up; 24 hour maintenance; electric car charging stations; bike storage and next thermostats.\n\nThe building will also have 20 percent of the units set aside to meet the City of Chicago’s Affordable Housing Ordinance. Rental rates for the units will be comparable to Hyde Park, and downtown. They expect units to lease quickly as excitement grows for the unmet demand. The West Loop was not “The West Loop” fifteen years ago. It took vision, and investment. We believe in South Shore, and we believe in the people of South Shore. If you want to be considered for a unit, or Commercial space please contact us via our website to be added to our list to receive additional information.\n\nWith the expertise of M.O.T. the XChange Development Project will bring the contemporary design and convenience that will spur activation and investment in Chicago’s historic South Shore neighborhood, bringing with it a restoration and revitalization of South Shore’s quality of life.\n\nThe XChange mixed use development project not only fits perfectly with the QLP, it also meets the objectives of Mayor Lightfoot’s impactfully Invest South/West initiative even though it’s a private investment by a local, emerging, minority/veteran owned real estate development company. M.O.T-DD is quick to point out that they have self funded one hundred percent all costs to date but are open to opportunities that can assist in accomplishing the goal.\n\nINVEST South/West is an unprecedented, intentional, community development initiative designed to ensure economic opportunities happen for Black and Brown residents in the target areas. If you aren’t aware of it or understand how it’s impacting the city, please look it up. This type of initiative has never been done before in the City of Chicago. No other administration in the history of this city ha s intentionally focused on addressing underserved areas, underserved real estate developers, and underserved residents to this extent. While there are many layers to the challenges that exist in our wonderful city, economic investment is the most critical component of revitalizing, and transforming lives and neighborhoods. “We think that the Invest South/West initiative is transformative! You have to give Mayor Lightfoot credit for executing her vision and keeping a campaign promise.\n\nIt’s inspiring and motivating to see fellow developers like Phil Beckham of P3 Markets, AJ Patton with 548 Capital, Leon Walker of DL3 Realty, and many others. Congratulations to them all! They are real tangible outcomes directly from intentional efforts. The XChange project is teed up and M.O.T-DD is ready to help transform our city also. Ideally, we’d like to be in the ground by Spring/Summer 2023.”\n\nOne high rise offering all the amenities that Hyde Park residents enjoy will be a beacon of change, seeming to shout from the rooftops that South Shore disinvestment is over, equity is present and current residents and business people matter.\n\nSince we recognize that The XChange Project is a huge undertaking, especially during the cur rent economic climate. We will need all hands-on deck to bring resources that will help make our plan a reality.\n\nStatus quo efforts will not get it done. We need a transformational approach to how we look at revitalizing underserved areas. The city of Chicago, the state of Illinois, local and national corporations, residents, nonprofits, and financial institutions.\n\nThe proposed project is currently under review with zoning, and the Department of Planning and we anxiously await the green light on the needed zoning variance to create the “Miracle on 72st and Exchange.”\n\nTo fully understand and embrace the XChange Project, one must know and appreciate M.O.T., who they are and what they’re all about. Mark Buford explains:\n\n“Individually we are a model of Transformation in our own uniqueness of how we have grown as human beings navigating the reality of being Black men in America. We have beaten the odds, and achieved a level of success in business, and personal evolution , and each are philosophically aligned understanding “I Am Because We Are, and We Are Because I Am.” Together we are MOT-DD, The Model Of Transformation Design & Development, Inc. We trust in each other’s individual strengths, and equal value as key components in accomplishing goals that benefit not only us but others. we are all Generation X which I call the generation of “Go Get”; Go get your education, got get your house, car, and material things, but with no strategic focus on legacy contributions to our culture. It is time for that to change. And so, we present to you MOT-DD, and The XChange project.\n\nThe Revolution will happen at the\n\nintersect ion of XChange and\n\nTransformation Ave.\n\nMeet us there\n\nJust south of the shore Where the winds of change blow to the east. To the east my brothers and sisters, to the east.”\n\n“This pivotal development will be transformational for a high-traffic area that has been devalued by the unsightly vacant lots that are the result of decades of disinvestment. Adjacent to one of South Shore’s gateway intersections, the XChange project will be a game-changer. It can’t happen soon enough!”\n\nCarol L. Adams, Ph.D.\n\nFounder,\n\nSouth Shore Works\n\n“The XChange project continues the momentum happening in South Shore by\n\nlocal residents and local developers. We are creating the change we want to see\n\nin South Shore. Along with new development housing and retail, the XChange\n\nproject will bring long and short term jobs to the community and anchor the\n\nExchange corridor. We’re in full support of this project.\n\nTonya Trice\n\nExecutive Director\n\nSouth Shore Chamber CDC\n\n“XChange Development is an overdue vibe for South Shore. It has been decades since we have had a luxury development. I am looking forward to the Change.”\n\nVal Free\n\nLead Steward,\n\nThe Neighborhood Network Alliance.\n\n‘I am excited to work with the M.O.T. team to bring another high-level investment\n\nto the South Shore Community. As Alderman in South Shore alone, I have invested\n\nover $60 million in Capital and infrastructure improvements, closed problematic\n\nbusinesses and taken many steps to address the vacant and abandoned property\n\nproblem, all of which makes South Shore more attractive to investors. The XChange Development will be a significant economic boost to the Exchange Avenue corridor and is the perfect complement to the $100 million Thrive Exchange development, coming to the corner of 79th and Exchange. South Shore residents will experience a renewed sense of economic vitality to a vital corridor. The future of the 7th Ward is under construction.”\n\nAlderman Gregory Mitchell\n\n7th Ward\n\nChicago City Council'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://chicago.suntimes.com/fran-spielman-show/2023/6/15/23762563/jack-lavin-chicago-chamber-tax-increases-bears-stadium-outdoor-dining', 'Headline': 'Chicago’s new mayor is off to a ‘very encouraging start,’ local ...', 'Snippet': 'Jack Lavin, Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce president, still isn’t willing, however, to back $800 million in business taxes Mayor Brandon Johnson wants for social programs that are key to his ...', 'Full_text': 'One of Chicago’s most influential business leaders said Thursday he is “very encouraged with the start” of Mayor Brandon Johnson’s administration, but not yet willing to support business taxes to bankroll the social programs that form the cornerstone of Johnson’s anti-violence strategy.\n\n“The Chicagoland Chamber is a pragmatic business group. We know that government, education, public safety, critical city services are not free. We know we have a pension liability of $37 billion. All of these things … require solutions. [But] we’re looking for reforms before revenue,” chamber president Jack Lavin, told the Sun-Times.\n\nThree months ago, Lavin endorsed Paul Vallas over Johnson in the April 4 mayoral runoff in a desperate attempt to stop the $800 million in new or increased taxes that Johnson has proposed to bankroll “investments in people.”\n\nLavin was equally concerned about Johnson’s history of supporting the concept of defunding the police at a time when violent crime in Chicago and the perception of it remain stubbornly high.\n\nNow that Johnson has been in office for more than a month, Lavin is singing a different tune. He said he’s genuinely encouraged that the new mayor is reaching out and getting to know the business leaders whose support he needs to create year-round jobs for young people.\n\nSame goes for Johnson’s willingness to collaborate, be flexible and seek business input before reinstating an employee head tax Lavin has condemned as a “job killer.”\n\nEqually impressive to business is the skill Johnson demonstrated in crafting an outdoor dining compromise that eluded former Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Lavin called the program “one of the silver linings” of the pandemic. It allowed struggling restaurants to add more tables on sidewalks, parking lots or even in the street, in some cases.\n\nLavin also pointed to Johnson’s early success in Springfield on maintaining different pension benefits for new and old employees.\n\n“He stopped two pension bills that were gonna start tearing down tier 2 on the pension, which has helped bring fiscal stability to our pension system in Illinois and all of the municipalities around the state. He said, ‘Hold up. We need to take a comprehensive look at these pension bills that would have been a sweetener for the firefighters’ pension. Their pensions are about 20% funded,” Lavin said Thursday.\n\n“We’re glad, from a fiscal stability standpoint ... that he said, ‘Let’s take a step back. ... He’s forming a task force. We want business to be at the table…The business community is ready to sit down and talk on pensions and really work on a comprehensive solution.”\n\nOne of the stalled bills would have increased benefits for Chicago firefighters hired after Jan. 1, 2011, when Illinois created a two-tiered pension system, reducing benefits for new hires.\n\nIt would have made the annual cost of living adjustment for the most junior Chicago firefighters equal to the full annual increase in the consumer price index. That’s double the current cost of living adjustment.\n\nThe second bill would have changed the final average salary used in calculating a Chicago firefighter’s pension.\n\nAcknowledging Chicago’s $37 billion pension crisis already has been studied to death, Lavin said he hopes Johnson’s task force will “negotiate actual solutions.”\n\n“A constitutional amendment is ... not gonna work. I don’t think it would pass. And so, we need to look beyond that. ... Look at other things like consolidating pension funds, which Gov. Pritzker has done. But we can do more. Stop spiking salaries at the end of careers. And look at, realistically, how can we fund it,” Lavin said.\n\n“If we’re gonna raise revenue to pay the pensions, let’s put the money in a lockbox for the pensions. That way, the business community would feel better that, if revenue is being raised, it’s going to solve the specific problem,” he said.\n\nDuring the campaign, Johnson acknowledged he needs the City Council and General Assembly to enact major portions of his $800 million tax plan, but he refused to identify a “Plan B” if either body balks.\n\n“I need industry to help come up with Plans B, C and D, just like working people had to come up with Plan B, C and D even though industry ... only went with Plan A,” that is, raising property taxes, Johnson told Crain’s Chicago Business in March. “That’s the problem that we have. That’s the problem that we’re gonna fix.”\n\nOn Thursday, Lavin urged the mayor to “take a step back and look comprehensively” at the “fiscal cliffs” confronting the city, Chicago Public Schools and the CTA as federal stimulus funds dry up. Johnson’s administration must “start solving those issues before we raise new taxes for new programs.”\n\nWith the occupancy rate of downtown offices still hovering at 50%, Lavin said it’s time to face reality: The number of employees in the Central Business District will probably never again be what it was before the pandemic, he said. Employees have grown too accustomed to the work/life balance of working from home.\n\n“We need to continue working on it from many different angles, and we’ll continue to drive that number up. … One of the really important things is our transit. ... safety and reliability. A lot of employees who work downtown — that’s one of the things they raise,” he said.\n\n“We need to continue to have our cultural and museums and those kinds of things happening downtown to create an energy and a vibrancy to get people back. And businesses are doing lots of different things. They’re providing lunch, breakfast. But also it’s about a company’s culture and bringing people together and having that innovation that happens when people are together,” he said.\n\nNASCAR’s street race on the first weekend of July, plus next summer’s Democratic National Convention, are “commercials to showcase all that Chicago has to offer,” boosting tourism and driving down a 28% vacancy rate along North Michigan Avenue, Lavin said.\n\nSo-called “downtown revitalization tax credits” would help to “bring in new kinds of retail — experiential retail.” So would “a better connection to the lakefront” and more outdoor dining that makes the Magnificent Mile a “warmer place to be,” he said.\n\nAs for the Bears’ stadium sweepstakes, Lavin said only that the team’s demands — in Arlington Heights, Waukegan, Naperville or Chicago — are “very reasonable.”\n\n“Like any business, they want stability in property taxes. We want to know what our property taxes will be,” Lavin said.\n\n“Now that the Bears have taken a step back in Arlington Heights, there is an opportunity for the mayor [Johnson] to put something forward,” he said. “And part of that is gonna be what kind of stability do you have on property taxes?”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.chicagotribune.com/2022/03/29/chicago-small-businesses-weigh-raising-prices-as-inflation-takes-toll-they-feel-the-pain-a-lot-more-than-larger-corporations-do/', 'Headline': 'Chicago small businesses weigh raising prices as inflation takes toll ...', 'Snippet': 'Phil Moy, operations manager for the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, said small businesses are still having a hard time finding qualified employees, a concern echoed by others across the city.', 'Full_text': 'In 2018, Reyna Gonzalez bought Dulceria La Fiesta, a Mexican candy and party store on Clark Street in Rogers Park. About three weeks later, the building caught fire. “We lost everything,” Gonzalez said.\n\nGonzalez reopened the store in July 2020. She taught herself how to make the custom piñatas that now make up the bulk of her business. For a while, things were going well; in 2021, she said, her sales tripled. But this past winter, the omicron variant hit Chicago.\n\n“It hit us hard,” she said. “We’ve been struggling ever since.”\n\nBecause the store was closed in 2019, Gonzalez wasn’t eligible for most pandemic relief programs, such as the federal Paycheck Protection Program, which require tax documents from 2019. She said she and her husband, who maintains a job outside the business, have exhausted their savings trying to keep the doors open. Now, rising costs have compounded her woes.\n\nIn midwinter — just as she was losing business — suppliers of the Mexican candy she stocks in the store started to raise their prices. Some items are now 50 cents to a dollar more expensive, Gonzalez said.\n\nGonzalez decided to lower prices on some products in an effort to draw customers in. She soon found herself having to raise them again, because she was losing too much. In recent weeks, Gonzalez said, it’s started to seem like business is picking up again. She’s hopeful.\n\nAfter two grueling pandemic years, inflation is climbing the list of challenges for small businesses. The consumer price index rose 7.9% in February from a year ago, the highest it’s been since the early 1980s. The regional consumer price index for the Chicago, Naperville and Elgin area was up 7.1% from a year ago, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSome in the Chicago small business community are hopeful, saying business has picked up in recent weeks. But costs are rising across the board, prompting many small business owners to increase prices while others try to hold out to avoid losing customers.\n\nIn a PNC economic outlook report conducted earlier this year, just more than half of U.S. small business owners said they expected to increase their prices over the next six months. The survey was conducted before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has exacerbated existing concerns about inflation and supply chain disruptions. Meanwhile, most pandemic-specific aid programs have dried up.\n\n“Small business owners are really struggling,” said Lotika Pai, the chief financial officer for the Women’s Business Development Center. “They feel the pain a lot more than larger corporations do. Because larger businesses have access to capital markets, they have greater cash on hand, they have access to bigger lines of credit.”\n\nWhen supply chains are constrained, Pai said, suppliers tend to favor larger businesses over smaller ones.\n\nTeresa Ging, the CEO of Loop bakery Sugar Bliss, has noticed business picking up. After working for much of the pandemic on her own or only with a pastry chef, Ging has close to 10 employees in the bakery, and she’s hiring. She’s developed a packaged cookie line that will launch with Walgreens later this spring.\n\nGing’s seeing a “huge demand” for corporate orders in particular. “They’re not as conscious of prices as a consumer buying one cupcake,” she said.\n\nStill, Ging said, inflation and supply chain disruptions are a challenge. The cost of everything has gone up: flour, sugar, butter, eggs, even paper cups and cupcake boxes. “It’s not even 1 to 2%,” she said. “It’s probably 10% to 20%, depending on what it is.”\n\nGing used to use a certain kind of dipping chocolate for the cake pops at Sugar Bliss; she had to change brands because of supply chain issues. Sugar Bliss just increased the price of their coffee for the first time in about five years. Ging is expecting to raise cupcake prices, too.\n\nMartha Razo, the CEO at Guero Pallets, a family pallet business located in South Austin, said she’s losing about 12 cents per pallet due to rising costs of lumber and fuel, which adds up to about $10,000 in a month. For now, she’s eating the cost so that she doesn’t lose customers, which include food, technology and packaging warehouses that use her products to store and move their own. When her losses get up to 15 cents per pallet, Razo’s decided, she’ll have to raise prices.\n\nGeri Sanchez Aglipay, administrator for the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Great Lakes region, said inflation is particularly challenging for women-owned small businesses, which she said tend to be clustered in industries like food and retail that have been most heavily impacted by the pandemic. Still, she said, inflation and supply chain issues have not stopped Americans from opening new businesses, with more than 5 million opening last year.\n\nAfter plunging more than 30% in March 2020, the number of small businesses operating in Illinois is approaching pre-pandemic levels, according to the Economic Opportunity Insights Tracker, a project from Harvard and Brown universities tracking the economic impact of COVID-19. As of January, the number was down 10% compared with January 2020, according to the tracker.\n\n“I think it’s still hard,” said Sandi Price, the executive director of the Rogers Park Business Alliance. It seems like as soon as businesses get past one hardship, another one pops up, she said. Still, Price added, the neighborhood saw more business openings than closures in 2021.\n\nPhil Moy, operations manager for the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, said small businesses are still having a hard time finding qualified employees, a concern echoed by others across the city. Rising costs have made it hard for businesses to avoid raising prices, he said. “It’s hard to find a lunch less than somewhere in between $15 and $20, where it seems to me that lunch was a $10 item years ago.”\n\nPai said that for many of the small community-based businesses that work with the Women’s Business Development Center, raising prices isn’t an option. They’re trying to remain accessible to the communities they serve, Pai said. Instead, they’re taking a hit to their profits.\n\nIn 2021, the average family had to spend $3,500 more than the year before to purchase the same goods and services, according to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model. Low-income and working-class families were most affected, the model found, because they spend a higher proportion of their income on “necessity goods” such as food, energy and transportation. The model found that for households making between $20,000 and $100,000 a year, increases in wages offset the higher cost of living on average. Working households making below $20,000, however, saw wages increase only about one-third of the increase in their cost of living.\n\nRelief from inflation is not coming soon, said Phillip Braun, a clinical professor of finance at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. “I view inflation as continuing to rise into next year,” he said. Braun said the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates more aggressively in order to have an impact on inflation. “Right now, their policy’s not that aggressive,” he said.\n\nLike Gonzalez of Dulceria La Fiesta, Jesse Reed wasn’t eligible for most pandemic aid programs. He opened his sustainable dry cleaning business, Green Collar Cleaners in Hyde Park, in January 2021.\n\nBusiness picked up starting last fall, he said, but things have gotten challenging over the last month. He believes inflation has played a role in slowing business down, with some people afraid to spend as much as they used to. Products he needs, from invoice tags to garment bags, are more expensive. There’s a hanger shortage, so he’s offering a hanger recycling program. Reed hasn’t yet raised his prices, but he’s considering doing so for his wash-and-fold services.\n\nReed said he’s not concerned about his customers abandoning him for traditional dry cleaners, which tend to be cheaper. His customers are eco-conscious, he said, and value his services even though they might cost more.\n\nHe is worried, though, that as paychecks get stretched further, people might decide to just wash their clothes at home.\n\nThe problem is twofold, Reed said. “People are spending less, and I have to spend more on products.”\n\ntasoglin@chicagotribune.com'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.southshorechamberinc.org/south-shore-chamber-of-commerce-adds-new-leadership/', 'Headline': 'South Shore Chamber of Commerce Adds New Leadership', 'Snippet': 'Prior to joining CRF, Maureen was a Director of Development at a local southside school, and a Director at a Community Entrepreneurial Development Center in Chicago.

In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected].\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://reason.com/2022/01/04/ashli-babbitts-violent-past-doesnt-justify-her-death/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's Violent Past Doesn't Justify Her Death - Reason.com"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt\'s Violent Past Doesn\'t Justify Her Death.

In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ashli-babbitt-mother-hanging-pelosi-b2404673.html', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt’s mother makes death threat against officer who shot ...', 'Snippet': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6 riot, has called for the Capitol Police officer who shot her daughter to be hanged — along with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.', 'Full_text': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6 riot, has called for the Capitol Police officer who shot her daughter to be hanged — along with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nMicki Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, said to a crowd of people, reportedly outside of the DC jail: “The Capitol Police needs to be abolished, or at the very least investigated.”\n\nShe continued, “Michael Byrd needs to swing from the end of a rope, along with Nancy Pelosi.” Ms Pelosi was serving as Speaker of the House on January 6, 2021.\n\nMs Witthoeft has in the past posted a photo of Michael Byrd on X, formerly known as Twitter, writing, “Today is July 1, 2022 and Michael Byrd is still a murderer profiting from my daughter’s death.”\n\nThe Justice Department announced in April 2021 that it would “not pursue criminal charges against” Mr Byrd, as its investigation “revealed no evidence to establish that, at the time the officer fired a single shot at Ms. Babbitt, the officer did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to do so in self-defense or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber.”\n\nStill, Babbitt’s mother has remained steadfast in her views.\n\nIn May, Ms Witthoeft was arrested and charged with simple assault — after pushing a counter-protester at a right-wing event outside a Washington DC jail — and destruction of property.\n\nShe was previously arrested in January this year in Washington DC while protesting on the second anniversary of the Capitol attack after a group of protesters, who didn’t have a permit to demonstrate on the Capitol grounds, tried to cross a street and enter the grounds.\n\nMs Witthoeft was arrested on two infractions: disobeying an order and blocking or obstructing a roadway. However, prosecutors later dropped the charges against her.\n\nBabbitt was killed during the Capitol riot, where she was seen wearing a Donald Trump flag as a cape. She was attempting to crawl through a broken window in the interior of the Capitol where lawmakers were still present in the Speaker’s Lobby. Although Capitol police officers warned the rioters to stay out, they continued to push inside.\n\nA Capitol police officer fired a shot at her while she was midway through a window, hitting her neck; she later died at a Washington DC hospital from the gunshot wound.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist - The New York ...', 'Snippet': 'On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol ...', 'Full_text': 'A mountain of evidence shows that the rioters were supporters of Mr. Trump, but that has not stopped the cascade of specious claims seeking to pin responsibility on others.\n\nA false theory blaming agitators affiliated with antifa, a loose collection of antifascist activists, began to spread on social media before the riot had even ended. Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-breach/police-chief-turned-yoga-instructor-insists-ashli-babbitt-is-not-dead-before-jan-6-judge-locks-him-up-for-more-than-a-decade/', 'Headline': ""Alan Hostetter insists Ashli Babbitt didn't die on Jan. 6 - Law & Crime"", 'Snippet': 'Police chief turned yoga instructor insists Ashli Babbitt is not dead before Jan. 6 judge locks him up for more than a decade.

Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas. He must reportedly surrender on or after Jan. 5, 2024.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/ashli-babbitt-a-martyr-her-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/2829546/', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a Martyr? Her Past Tells a More Complex Story', 'Snippet': 'The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight ...', 'Full_text': ""The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt's birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.""}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot', 'Headline': 'Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot', 'Snippet': 'claim: ashli babbitt was killed by an officer working for democrats Babbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the ...', 'Full_text': 'Millions of Americans watched the events in Washington last Jan. 6 unfold on live television. Police officers testified to the violence and mayhem. Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.\n\nYet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public’s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained attack on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.\n\nBy excusing former President Donald Trump of responsibility, minimizing the mob’s violence and casting the rioters as martyrs, falsehoods about the insurrection aim to deflect blame for Jan. 6 while sustaining Trump’s unfounded claims about the free and fair election in 2020 that he lost.\n\nSpread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes.\n\nSeveral different conspiracy theories have emerged in the year since the insurrection, according to an analysis of online content by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs on behalf of The Associated Press. Unfounded claims that the rioters were members of antifa went viral first, only to be overtaken by a baseless claim blaming FBI operatives. Other theories say the rioters were peaceful and were framed for crimes that never happened.\n\nConspiracy theories have long lurked in the background of American history, said Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University professor who studies political misinformation. But they can become dangerous when they lead people to distrust democracy or to excuse or embrace violence.\n\n“If we’re no longer operating from the same foundation of facts, then it’s going to be a lot harder to have conversations as a country,” Carnahan said. “It will fuel more divisions in our country, and I think that ultimately is the legacy of the misinformation we’re seeing right now.”\n\nAn examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T TRUMP SUPPORTERS\n\nIn fact, many of those who came to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said — proudly, publicly, repeatedly — that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nDifferent versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa.\n\n“Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,” Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.”\n\nThe next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim.\n\nAnother Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven’t been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants.\n\nYet Carlson claimed on his show that “in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.”\n\nCarlson is a “main driver” of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal’s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.\n\n“Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,” Gaetz said.\n\nSpokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.\n\nIn truth, the rioters are just who they said they were.\n\nOne was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.\n\n“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans said on the video. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” Vice President Mike Pence was in the building to preside over the Senate’s certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. Pence went ahead despite Trump’s pleas to get Pence to block the transfer of power.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by “fake Trump protesters.”\n\n“We have not seen evidence of that,” said Wray, who was appointed by Trump.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T VIOLENT\n\nDozens of police officers were severely injured. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and died a day later of natural causes.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who rushed to the scene, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” The assault stopped only when he said he had children. He later learned he had suffered a heart attack. Fanone resigned from the department in December 2021.\n\nRioters broke into the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled under armed protection. They rifled through desks and looked for lawmakers, yelling, “Where are they?” In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.\n\nThat’s not how some Republican politicians have described the insurrection.\n\nAppearing on Ingraham’s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.\n\n“By and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has since said that he doesn’t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a “normal tourist visit.” Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.\n\nTrump called the insurrection a display of “ spirit and faith and love.”\n\nRioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose.\n\n“The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,” Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. “And, you know, I won’t be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.”\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS\n\nTrump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nImmediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been “cheated” and “defrauded” in the “rigged” election by a “criminal enterprise” that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol.\n\nAt one point, Trump did urge his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.” The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric.\n\n“We fight. We fight like hell,” he told those who would later break into the Capitol. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nNow, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.\n\n“I wasn’t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,” Trump said on Fox News in December.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN OFFICER WORKING FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nBabbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed. An investigation cleared the officer of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Capitol Police Department protects all members of Congress, as well as employees, the public and Capitol facilities. The officer wasn’t assigned to any particular lawmaker.\n\nTrump falsely claimed the officer was the head of security “for a certain high official, a Democrat,” and was being shielded from accountability. He also misstated where Babbitt was shot.\n\n“Who is the person that shot … an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?” Trump asked on Fox News.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE JAN. 6 SUSPECTS ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ARE BEING MISTREATED\n\nNo, they are not, despite some assertions from members of Congress.\n\n“J6 defendants are political prisoners of war,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted in November. She said she had visited some suspects in jail who complained about the food, medical care and “re-education” they were receiving in custody.\n\nRep.

Michael Byrd as she tried to crawl through a broken window to enter the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021 as a mob of Trump supporters were storming the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“My daughter was a proud American patriot,” Witthoeft said. “She served this country her whole adult life. She loved God, America and loved her family.”\n\nWitthoeft then claimed her daughter was “murdered by a careless, reckless” Capitol Police officer.\n\n“She came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election, and little did we know that would be the last time she heard anybody speak,” the grieving mom said.\n\nByrd was exonerated of any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death in an internal use-of-force probe.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News last August, Byrd said he was “doing my job” and saw Babbitt as a threat to lawmakers in the House of Representatives.\n\n“I was very afraid,” Byrd told anchor Lester Holt. “I’m hearing about the breaches of different barricaded areas, officers being overrun, officers being down.”\n\nWitthoeft also called for the release of 14,000 hours of video captured on security cameras in the Capitol.\n\n“I would like to say to [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi, this is not your playhouse.

When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nREAD MORE: Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot\n\nBabbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed. The officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\nHer husband, Aaron, declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris viewed her.\n\nCourt records involving the 2016 violent confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nNorris later got a judicial order that barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family.\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.'}}",91.125,1

The office declined further comment Friday.\n\nJoshua Stanton, counsel at Perry Law who is based in Washington, D.C., said that it’s not just the fake electors who face jeopardy, but those who might have misled those people before they signed the documents claiming to be the rightful electors.\n\n“There is significant evidence that a lot of these false electors it seems across the country were aware that Trump had definitely lost, that his litigation attempts were bogus, and that this was really being used as part of an effort, an illegal effort, to overturn the election,"" said Stanton, who clerked at U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.\n\nAt a previous firm he represented recording artists, professional athletes, actors and business executives.\n\nHe said prosecuting the electors might depend on what they were told by people working with Trump to overturn the election, and whether they thought they were only to be used if the elections in those states were overturned by the courts for some reason. They in fact were used even though court challenges to overturn the state elections all failed.\n\n“If the false electors, when they signed that form, honestly believed that (they would only be used if the GOP won in court), then it seems likely that they didn’t do anything wrong,” Stanton said. “It would be hard to actually prosecute them.”\n\nNone of the Arizona GOP representatives who signed false documents contacted by The Arizona Republic in recent months have agreed to talk on the record.\n\nStanton said it’s possible prosecutors already have evidence to show they knew the documents would be sent to Congress even if the courts didn\'t overturn the state elections. It appears the co-conspirators named in the indictment didn\'t plan to use the fake electors only as a contingency.\n\n“Even if the false electors themselves maybe potentially avoid liability, there are a number of people at the higher levels that could face charges in Arizona,” Stanton said.\n\nHe said that based on what is known publicly so far, charges could still come from the federal or state level for those people.\n\nThe indictment seems to offer an out to the false electors by stating they were misled by people trying to help Trump overturn the election.\n\n“It’s not necessarily the false electors who could end up getting indicted,"" Stanton said. ""It’s the folks who maybe misled them.""\n\nElection exodus: The exodus of Arizona election officials continues. This time, it\'s in ruby-red Mohave County\n\nStanton referenced emails from Arizona lawyer Jack Wilenchik, reported last year in The New York Times, including one in which Wilenchik referred to the electors as ""fake.""\n\n“We would just be sending in ‘fake’ electoral votes to Pence so that ‘someone’ in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the ‘fake’ votes should be counted,” Wilenchik wrote in a Dec. 8, 2020, email to Boris Epshteyn, a strategic adviser for the Trump campaign, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik later wrote that “alternative” was a better term than “fake.”\n\nWilenchik also wrote the idea that it could launch an objection in Congress to certifying the vote for Biden, and acknowledged that the electors\' votes should not count, according to another email reported by the Times.\n\n“His idea is basically that all of us (GA, WI, AZ, PA, etc.) have our electors send in their votes (even though the votes aren’t legal under federal law — because they’re not signed by the Governor); so that members of Congress can fight about whether they should be counted on January 6th,” Wilenchik wrote in the email on Dec. 8, 2020, to Epshteyn and others, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik told The Arizona Republic on Friday that in those emails he was only offering an opinion on the plan for Trump\'s campaign staff when asked, and he believed the actions were legal.\n\n""I believed then and I believe now it is completely legal, as do a number of legal scholars,"" Wilenchik said. ""There is no crime I can even conceive of here.""\n\nHe referenced recent comments from legal scholar Alan Dershowitz supporting the idea that submitting alternate electors is the proper way to protest an election.\n\nDershowitz, a nationally recognized constitutional lawyer, recently said during a FOX News appearance that submitting the alternate electors was the proper way to address state elections where the rightful winner is undecided.\n\n""The way you protest an election is to come up with an alternate slate of electors. That was done in 1960,"" Dershowitz said, referencing the race in Hawaii that year between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.\n\nNixon was certified the winner by the state governor after prevailing by 140 votes that year, but a recount was underway the day electors met to cast votes. Electors for both candidates signed certificates and delivered them to Congress.\n\n""And a court in Hawaii said that\'s the right way to do it,"" continued Dershowitz, who was recently among a team of lawyers sanctioned for filing a meritless lawsuit on behalf of Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake that sought to force counties to hand count ballots.\n\nWilenchik said Dershowitz\'s comments support the move as legitimate, and he called the prosecution in Michigan ""bogus and political.""\n\n“What these people put on their certificates here in Arizona was just that we believe we are the duly elected electors. They didn’t say they were certified. They weren’t certified,"" Wilenchik continued. ""That is what I was pointing out in the email. Certified means the governor and secretary of state were signing off on it.”\n\nWilenchik said he did not mislead any of the people who signed the documents or tell them the documents would only be submitted if courts overturned Arizona’s election.\n\nExpert says state charges more likely than federal\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political sciences in the School of Global Politics and the Sandra Day O\'Connor College of Law at ASU, said state charges are more likely than federal charges for the Arizona fake electors.\n\n“It may be that the federal government has concluded this is best left to the state attorneys general to prosecute,” she said.\n\nLindquist clerked for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia and practiced law at Latham and Watkins in Washington, D.C.\n\nEven setting aside the possibility of charging the electors with a criminal conspiracy, Arizona has a statute that criminalizes creating a public record ""knowing that it has been falsely made,"" that could apply to the document the electors sent to Congress, she said.\n\nIt doesn\'t help the Arizona fake electors that two states, Pennsylvania and New Mexico, offered conditional language in their documents stating they would only be valid if those state elections were overturned, while Arizona and the other states did not.\n\nThe federal indictment states that Trump’s allies wanted to prevent the other fake electors from using similar conditional language, which she said was improper on their part.\n\n“What a cynical, fraudulent thing to do to these dupes in the state legislatures,” she said. “It’s not that these people shouldn’t have known better. I think they should have. There’s no doubt they were manipulated by the conspirators.”\n\nIt’s possible the Justice Department intentionally let the electors off the hook so that it might secure testimony from those people to help prosecute Trump or the co-conspirators, she said.\n\nThe states where fake electors submitted documents were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe fake electors in Arizona were: Tyler Bowyer, an executive with Turning Point USA and a committeeman for the Republican National Committee; Nancy Cottle, who chaired the Arizona Trump electors; lawmaker Jake Hoffman; state senator Anthony Kern; Jim Lamon, a failed U.S. Senate candidate; Robert Montgomery of the Cochise County Republican Committee; Samuel Moorhead of the Gila County Republican Party; Loraine Pellegrino, the secretary of the Arizona Trump electors; Greg Safsten, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; Kelli Ward, the state GOP chair at the time; and Michael Ward, her husband and a GOP activist.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/21/us/jan-6-hearing-trump/rusty-bowers-arizona-trump-jan-6', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Hearings Day 4: Panel Ties Trump to False Electors Plan - The ...', 'Snippet': 'An aide to Senator Ron Johnson tried to arrange for the senator to provide fake electors from Michigan and Wisconsin to Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021. ... of Arizona’s electors for ...', 'Full_text': 'The hearing demonstrated the human costs of the waves of threats and intimidation set off by Mr. Trump and his supporters as they pressured state officials and election workers to find a way to deprive Joseph R. Biden Jr. of his victory.\n\nHere are four takeaways.\n\nTrump was directly involved in the ‘fake electors’ plan.\n\nThe committee showed evidence that Mr. Trump was directly involved behind the scenes in trying to put forward the alternate slates of Trump electors that he hoped could replace the electors awarded to Mr. Biden through his victories in swing states like Arizona and Georgia.\n\nMr. Trump called Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, to ask her to talk to one of his outside lawyers, John Eastman, who was on the line, about the plan, Ms. McDaniel said in a video clip of her deposition to the committee. Mr. Trump wanted Ms. McDaniel, she said, to talk to Mr. Eastman “about the importance of the R.N.C. helping the campaign gather these contingent electors” if Mr. Trump’s legal challenges were successful.\n\nAs Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman were undertaking the scheme, the White House Counsel’s Office held a meeting with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani; the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and other aides, where they were told that the plan was not legally sound, according to recorded testimony from a West Wing aide, Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nThe committee did not say whether Mr. Trump was told about the meeting with the White House Counsel’s Office. Last week, the panel revealed that Mr. Trump had been told by Mr. Eastman that the broader effort they were pursuing to convince Vice President Mike Pence to block or delay certification of the Electoral College count in Mr. Biden’s favor had no legal basis — a fact that legal experts say could help prosecutors build a criminal case against Mr. Trump.\n\nG.O.P. elected officials pushed the electors scheme.\n\nThe committee showed that Republicans in Congress were pushing the alternate electors plan even on Jan. 6, hours before the day’s violence, which had the effect of stopping the certification of the electoral count as Mr. Pence was whisked away from the mob.\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, told an aide for Mr. Pence on Jan. 6 that Mr. Johnson wanted to give Mr. Pence a list of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, two states won by Mr. Biden.\n\n“Johnson needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise,” Sean Riley, an aide to Mr. Johnson, texted an aide to Mr. Pence, according to messages released by the committee.\n\n“What is it?” Chris Hodgson, the aide to Mr. Pence, replied.\n\n“Alternate slate of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Mr. Riley said.\n\n“Do not give that to him,” Mr. Hodgson texted back.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Johnson, Alexa Henning, said on Twitter that he “had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office.”\n\nThe communications with the vice president’s office, she said, were “staff to staff” and the documents were never sent to Mr. Pence.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, another Trump ally on Capitol Hill, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, reached out to Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and a Republican, to see if he would support the decertification of Arizona’s electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Mr. Bowers recounted telling Mr. Biggs.\n\nTrump’s allies could not produce evidence of election fraud.\n\nThe committee showed examples of how Mr. Trump and his allies knew that there was no evidence that the election had been stolen.\n\nMr. Bowers recounted how Mr. Giuliani acknowledged to him at one point in a phone call that they could not find the evidence of fraud that they needed.\n\n“He said, ‘We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence,’” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani telling him. “And I don’t know if that was a gaffe or maybe he didn’t think through what he said, but both myself and others in my group, the three in my group and my counsel, both remembered that specifically, and afterwards, we kind of laughed about it.”\n\nAt another point, Mr. Eastman was pressing Mr. Bowers to embrace the plan to push a slate of Trump electors from Arizona despite the state’s certification of Mr. Biden’s victory there. Mr. Bowers said that he questioned how he could legally participate in the scheme and that Mr. Eastman responded by saying, “Just do it and let the courts sort it out.”\n\nThreats and intimidation started well before Jan. 6.\n\nThe public pressure that Mr. Trump and his allies put on state election officials resulted in the officials being targeted in frightening and intimidating ways by Trump supporters.\n\nShaye Moss, an elections worker in Fulton County, Ga., who, along with her mother, had been falsely accused by Mr. Giuliani of committing election fraud, provided a dramatic portrait of the harassment that Mr. Giuliani’s false claims had spawned. She described the racist messages she received on Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me, telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, ‘Be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Ms. Moss said.\n\nShe said that the entire episode, and the attention that came with it, had “turned my life upside down.”\n\n“I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” she said. “I don’t want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something. I don’t go to the grocery store at all. I haven’t been anywhere at all. I’ve gained about 60 pounds. I just don’t do nothing anymore. I don’t want to go anywhere.”\n\nShe said she loved her job as an election worker but ultimately quit.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, recounted how the home of his son’s widow had been broken into.\n\nMr. Bowers was the target of protests and threats as his daughter was dying. And he described how his office had received over 20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voice mail messages and texts that made it impossible for him and his staff to communicate.\n\n“It is the new pattern or a pattern in our lives to worry what will happen on Saturdays because we have various groups come by and they have had video panel trucks with videos of me proclaiming me to be a pedophile and a pervert and a corrupt politician and blaring loudspeakers in my neighborhood,” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nChris Cameron contributed reporting.\n\nNeither Mr. Holder nor the committee has disclosed the contents of the full trove of videos, and neither has commented on whether it provides substantial new information about Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss.\n\nBut the small piece of it seen by The Times was striking for how it shows Ms. Trump using a different tone in describing her father’s efforts to overturn the outcome than she did in the portion of her deposition to the House committee that has been made public so far.\n\nThe interview for the documentary was conducted on Dec. 10, 2020, the person with access to the video said. That was nine days after a public statement by Attorney General William P. Barr, who declared at the time that there was no widespread fraud impacting the election’s outcome, a rare public rebuke of Mr. Trump’s claims at the time.\n\nIn her recorded interview with the House committee, Ms. Trump said that Mr. Barr’s comments “affected my perspective.”\n\n“I respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he said,” she said. The committee may release additional video of her recorded testimony.\n\nPeople close to Ms. Trump have insisted that she had distanced herself from what was taking place around her father at that time. Those people have said that, after the race was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Trump began focusing on winding down her office and looking toward a new life in Miami.\n\nYet in the video with the filmmaker, Ms. Trump, describing her father’s gains in votes among key demographic groups, had a different reaction when asked whether she had a “take” on her father’s “very clear position on the results and what’s going on.”\n\n“I think that, as the president has said, every single vote needs to be counted and needs to be heard, and he campaigned for the voiceless,” Ms. Trump replied. “And I think a lot of Americans feel very, very disenfranchised right now, and really, question the sanctity of our elections, and that’s not right, it’s not acceptable.”\n\nShe went on, “And he has to take on this fight. Look, you fight for what you love the most and he loves this country and he loves this country’s people, and he wants to make sure that their voice is, is heard and not muted.”\n\nShe said that he “will continue to fight until every legal remedy is exhausted and that’s what he should do.”\n\nAn aide to Ms. Trump did not respond to a message about the new video.\n\nThe filmmaker was connected to Mr. Kushner by Jason Greenblatt, a former lawyer at the Trump Organization and then the White House envoy to the Middle East. The film was envisioned as a legacy project for Mr. Trump, according to two people familiar with how it came about.\n\nMr. Bowers, who spoke about the Constitution in reverential and spiritual terms, had tears in his eyes as he described his gravely ill daughter enduring some of the harassment outside their house. (She died in late January.)\n\n“It was disturbing,” he said. “It was disturbing.”\n\nThe effort to persuade him to take steps to flip the outcome in Arizona to Mr. Trump’s column — the state was won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. — began with pressure from Mr. Trump, and one of his lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who maintained that he had evidence of fraud. “Aren’t we all Republicans here? I would think we would get a better reception,” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani saying at one point.\n\nSoon after Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, certified the state for Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani and an associate, Jenna Ellis, met with Arizona lawmakers, including Mr. Bowers, Mr. Bowers recalled. Mr. Bowers described Ms. Ellis asserting that they had evidence of widespread voter fraud, only to provide none.\n\n“I said, ‘I want the names. Do you have the names of the supposedly dead or fraudulent voters?’” Mr. Bowers said. “She said, ‘Yes.’”\n\nNothing was produced. Eventually, he recalled, Mr. Giuliani said, “We’ve got lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”\n\nMr. Bowers also recalled speaking to Mr. Trump, making clear to the president that he “wouldn’t do anything illegal for him,” as one questioner, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said. Nonetheless, another lawyer advising Mr. Trump, John Eastman, called Mr. Bowers in early January and urged him to schedule a legislative vote to “decertify the electors, because we had plenary authority to do so.”\n\nMr. Eastman, Mr. Bowers testified, said that he should “just do it and let the courts figure it all out.”\n\nMr. Bowers again rejected the push, saying, “I took an oath — for me to take that, to do what you do would be counter to my oath.”\n\nFinally, he testified, there was a call from another Trump supporter, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, when the Electoral College vote was to be confirmed by a joint session of Congress. Mr. Biggs, he said, pushed him again to undo the state’s certification of its electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“We have no legal pathway” to “execute such a request,” Mr. Bowers recalled saying. He also recalled his reaction when he learned that Trump advisers pushed ahead with a scheme to put forward slates of “alternate” electors. “I thought of the book, ‘The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,’” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nMr. Bowers’s personal journal contained an entry in which he said, “I do not want to be a winner by cheating. I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” He was invited to read it into the testimony.\n\nHe was also asked for his reaction to a statement from Mr. Trump criticizing Mr. Bowers’s testimony in advance, in which he claimed that Mr. Bowers had told him the election was “rigged” and that he had won the state.\n\n“I did have a conversation with the president,” Mr. Bowers said. “That certainly isn’t it.”\n\nA moment later, more emphatically, he said, “Anywhere, anyone, any time has said that I said the election was rigged — that would not be true.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/11/court-turns-down-request-for-relief-in-arizona-leaderships-voting-law-dispute/', 'Headline': 'Court turns down request for relief in Arizona leadership ... - SCOTUSblog', 'Snippet': 'The Arizona state legislative buildings in Phoenix.

In a brief unsigned order without any noted dissents, the justices turned down an emergency filing from Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and Warren Petersen, the president of the Arizona Senate.\n\nThe laws at the center of the dispute were enacted in 2022. They require would-be voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship or face penalties, such as a ban on voting in most elections or an outright bar on voting by mail. The Biden administration and other plaintiffs, including the Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party, went to federal court to challenge the laws, arguing that they violated (among other things) the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection and federal voting laws.\n\nToma and Petersen joined the case to defend the laws after the state’s attorney general, Democrat Kris Mayes, declined to do so in full. The challengers then sought discovery from them, including to depose them about the legislature’s intent in passing the laws. Toma and Petersen argued that an order requiring them to appear for a deposition would violate the legislative privilege – that is, the idea that legislators are shielded from both criminal and civil liability, as well as being compelled to answer questions or produce documents, regarding anything that is an integral part of the legislative process.\n\nThe district rejected that argument, ruling that Toma and Petersen had waived their privilege when they opted to join the case, and both the district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that the depositions could go forward.\n\nToma and Petersen came to the Supreme Court on Nov. 20, asking the justices to put the depositions and discovery on hold to give them time to file a petition for a writ of mandamus – an order directing the lower court to reverse its order on the legislative privilege question. They told the justices that the district court’s “unprecedented ruling will chill both the atmosphere for all legislators to freely express their views during the legislative process and the ability and willingness of present and future legislative leaders to participate in litigation to defend the constitutionality of state laws.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party urged the justices to turn down the request. They emphasized that the discovery requests do not seek information about the legislators’ personal motives, but instead about the legislature’s intent, which “is a proper subject for discovery because plaintiffs’ claims in this litigation include that the challenged laws violate the Equal Protection Clause; one element of such a claim is discriminatory intent or purpose by the legislature.”\n\nAnd Toma and Petersen have other options besides a writ of mandamus, the Democrats argued. For example, they could decline to “comply with the discovery order and then appeal any resulting sanctions or contempt order.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rusty-bowers-censured-arizona-republican-party-house-january-6-committee-witness/', 'Headline': 'Arizona GOP censures Rusty Bowers, who testified before Jan. 6 House ...', 'Snippet': 'Bowers told the committee the scheme to replace Mr. Biden\'s electors with a fake slate for Trump was a ""tragic parody"" and emotionally discussed protesters showing up at his home after he defied ...', 'Full_text': 'Washington — The Republican Party of Arizona\'s executive committee censured Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the state House who testified on Capitol Hill about the events surrounding the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, on Tuesday night.\n\nKelli Ward, chairwoman of the Arizona GOP, announced the condemnation by the panel on Twitter, saying Bowers is ""no longer a Republican in good standing & we call on Republicans to replace him at the ballot box in the August primary.""\n\nThe censure resolution from the state party criticized Bowers for a number of actions as a state House member, including on election integrity, immigration and gender identity.

It would mandate, for instance, that election workers hand-count ballots instead of using electronic equipment to tabulate results.\n\nThe bill would “create a system where losers can set aside the will of the people,” said Alex Gulotta, who runs the Arizona chapter of the voting rights group All Voting is Local. “This is an all-out assault on the freedom to vote.”\n\nThe bill’s lead sponsor, GOP Rep. John Fillmore, told CNN in a telephone interview that he’s trying to “ensure the integrity of the voting process.”\n\nUnder his proposal, lawmakers would meet to either “accept or reject election results” following primary and general elections. If legislators reject the results, any qualified voter “may file an action in the Superior Court to request that a new election be held,” according to the bill.\n\nFillmore said lawmakers should possess authority as “representatives of the people” to review the vote count. But, he said, “if there’s a problem, we’re not overturning anything. We’re just trying to put the skids on it and say, ‘This has to be adjudicated.’ “\n\nCurrently, in Arizona, the secretary of state certifies the statewide election results, which also are signed by the governor, state attorney general and chief justice of the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe bill also would eliminate the state’s widely used early voting-by-mail program and prohibit officials from requiring voters to wear masks at polling places.\n\nFifteen other lawmakers have cosponsored Fillmore’s bill, including state Rep. Mark Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state. Former President Donald Trump has endorsed his bid to become Arizona’s election chief.\n\nFinchem did not respond to a CNN inquiry.\n\n“The fact that (Arizona lawmakers) are willing to put their names on these democracy-ending bills is a sign of where we’re going to go if we don’t, as a country, start speaking out against this stuff,” Gulotta said.\n\nArizona – a state President Joe Biden flipped by fewer than 11,000 votes – has been at the forefront of brazen attempts by Trump loyalists to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate last year commissioned an error-plagued hand count of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix.\n\nThe review, undertaken by a Florida firm called Cyber Ninjas, affirmed Biden’s win, but election officials widely discredited the company’s methods and most of its conclusions. The firm recently shut down.\n\nThe state will hold one of the marquee US Senate contests this year as Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly seeks reelection to a full term. Kelly, one of the chamber’s most vulnerable incumbents, won a special election in 2020 to fill the seat once held by late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican.\n\nIt’s not clear that Fillmore’s measure will gain traction in the legislature.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers, but by narrow margins. As a result, a handful of GOP defectors can sink legislation pushed by others in their party. Last year, a GOP proposal that would have allowed the state legislature to revoke presidential electors chosen through the popular vote and appoint its own slate failed.\n\nFillmore’s proposal – along with his recent remarks suggesting the state return to what he described as 1950s voting practices – sparked rebukes.\n\n“We need to get back to 1958-style of voting,” Fillmore said during a House committee meeting Wednesday – as he argued that voters should cast paper ballots, in person, on Election Day.\n\nOfficials with the Democratic Leadership Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to state legislatures, denounced the comments.\n\n“Republicans have started saying the quiet part out loud: their restrictive voting laws have nothing to do with promoting safe and accessible elections — they just want to drag us back to before the Civil Rights Movement,” Gabrielle Chew, the group’s vice president of communications, said in a statement.\n\nIn the interview with CNN, Fillmore said that by calling it a “1958 bill” he was describing the procedures he prefers, not an era. “In person, no electronics, on paper, count the ballots that day,” he added, ticking off his preferred voting rules.\n\nSo far this year, Arizona Republicans have introduced dozens of bills they say are needed to restore voter trust in elections.\n\nOne, approved by a House committee this week, would ban the use of unmonitored ballot drop boxes. Another bill would create a new “bureau of elections” in the governor’s office with a $5 million budget and subpoena powers to “investigate allegations of fraud in any state county or local government election.” (It follows a proposal that Florida’s Republican Gov.

Rusty Bowers, but the Arizona House speaker has quietly made a name for himself in the state as the stealth killer of his party’s most extreme election ideas.\n\nFirst up was a bill that would have ripped up most voting rules in this battleground state and handed the state legislature the power to reject election results it didn’t like.\n\nIn a bit of parliamentary jiu jitsu, Bowers assigned the bill to 12 committees at once, ensuring it would go nowhere. Its sponsor, GOP state Rep. John Fillmore, called it a “12-committee lynching.”\n\nArizona Mirror journalist Jeremy Duda offered a colorful take – describing Bowers’ takedown as “killing the bill, chopping it up, setting the pieces on fire, then digging up the ashes and throwing them into the ocean.”\n\nThen came Rep. Mark Finchem’s resolution this month on Arizona’s 2020 election results. Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state this year with Trump’s endorsement, makes mostly debunked claims of fraud to call for the results to be set aside in three counties. It includes Maricopa, the state’s most populous county, targeted last year in a problem-plagued ballot review ordered by Republicans in the state Senate.\n\nBowers’ response to the proposal, per The Arizona Republic: “Mr. Finchem’s obviously unconstitutional and profoundly unwise proposal will receive all of the consideration it deserves.”\n\nBowers, a professional painter and sculptor who represents a district east of Phoenix, has a contrarian history – at least when it comes to some of his party’s most outlandish maneuvers in recent years.\n\nHe has described Trump and the then-President’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani calling him after the 2020 election, asking Bowers to somehow inject the legislature into the certification process before the state sent its slate of 11 presidential electors to Congress.\n\nBowers told CNN’s Dianne Gallagher that he voted and campaigned for Trump but rebuffed that. “I said, ‘No, I won’t,’” Bowers recounted in a CNN interview last year, adding, “‘3.5 million people voted here, I’m not gonna unilaterally do that.’”\n\nBowers is term-limited in the Arizona House, and last week announced plans to run for the state Senate.\n\nArizona at ground zero\n\nEven as headline-grabbing election bills falter in Arizona, Republican lawmakers still are weighing a raft of proposals that could alter voting practices in a battleground state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes.\n\nThey include bills that would:\n\nA database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows that Arizona accounts for nearly 10% of all the election-related bills in states this year.\n\nAlex Gulotta, a voting rights activist who runs the Arizona branch of All Voting is Local, said he credits Bowers with “holding the line” to block some of the most blatantly undemocratic ideas floated in the state.\n\nBut, he said, “there are actually a lot of bad things” moving through the legislature “that people are being silent about.”\n\nThe stakes are high in Arizona this year.\n\nVoters will fill an open gubernatorial seat, now held by term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, and decide whether to return one of most vulnerable Senate incumbents, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, to Congress.\n\nThe filing deadline for candidates in Arizona is April 4.

Viral online posts distorted his comments to misleadingly claim that half of employees at federal health agencies “are refusing” the vaccines, which Fauci never said.\n\nAt the time, NIAID told us that 67% of the NIH staff were vaccinated, but the “actual number may be higher” because reporting was voluntary.\n\nSee, “Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations,” May 21, 2021\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. But a Gateway Pundit story shared on Facebook in June 2021 declared, “SMOKING GUN: FAUCI LIED, MILLIONS DIED — Fauci Was Informed of Hydroxychloroquine Success in Early 2020 But Lied to Public Instead Despite the Science.”\n\nThe story was based on two emails that were sent to Fauci in February 2020. In one email, two doctors expressed the possibility that the drug could be effective against COVID-19. Fauci forwarded the email to an NIH deputy director who works in microbiology and infectious diseases and wrote: “Please take a look and respond to them. Thanks.”\n\nIn the other email, a pharmacologist made reference to “data from 2005 showing inhibition of SARS infection,” which is a different disease caused by a different coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) from the one that leads to COVID-19. We previously wrote about a 2005 study that found the drug prevented the spread of that SARS virus in cell culture — which is not the same as working in humans.\n\nThose emails are not evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, or that Fauci kept this from the public. In fact, randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The drug was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nA viral social media post falsely claimed that Fauci was “pushing” remdesivir because he “invented” it with Bill Gates and they would profit from its use.\n\nFauci does not hold a patent for remdesivir, and a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told USA Today that the foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of the drug.\n\nSee, “Fauci Didn’t Invent, Won’t Profit from Remdesivir,” May 21, 2020\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nIt is still uncertain how SARS-CoV-2 originated, but many scientists suspect the virus “spilled over” into humans from an animal. There is no evidence the virus was created in a lab, let alone as part of any U.S.-funded research.\n\nA June 2021 Facebook post claimed that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” because of an email he received from Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. In that Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” He mentioned others, too, found “the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\n\nBut Andersen said in his email that more analysis was necessary and “opinions could still change,” which is what later happened.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists that said they determined that the coronavirus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The authors added that they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.”\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nFormer White House trade adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that Fauci “killed a lot of people” by funding some bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is in Wuhan, China, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified.\n\nNIAID did provide a multimillion-dollar grant to fund some of the lab’s research, but the NIH has explained that those experiments could not have led to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because the viruses that were being studied were very different.\n\n“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” then-NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20, 2021, statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”\n\nSee, “Navarro Falsely Links Fauci to Pandemic Origin,” May 19, 2022\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul accused Fauci of lying when Fauci said in a May 2021 Senate hearing that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” But there’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in a July 20, 2021, hearing, about funding gain-of-function research — which the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to “increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.”\n\nFauci has said that the research that was funded “was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,” and the NIH has said the same. The issue is that scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul has posited that Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” if the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research. But there is no proof of a lab leak, and there is evidence that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant could not have caused the pandemic.\n\nSee, “The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,” May 21, 2021, and “Fauci and Paul, Round 2,” July 22, 2021\n\nIn December 2014, the NIH posted a photo of Fauci and former President Barack Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The photo showed Obama speaking about Ebola research with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, and Fauci was shown standing next to Sylvia Burwell, who was the health and human services secretary at the time.\n\nBut the years-old photo was circulated in 2020 along with the false claim that the image showed “Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015,” suggesting a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee, “Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab,'”July 17, 2020\n\nOther Claims\n\nA series of reports in 2021 from a group that opposes federal funding for research relying on animal testing prompted dozens of readers to ask us if Fauci had a history of cruelty to animals, specifically beagles.\n\nThe NIAID admitted to FactCheck.org in a statement that Fauci was involved in the process of awarding funding for a number of research projects that used beagles as test subjects. But the agency denied that it funded one particular project in Tunisia that went viral on social media because of images from a published study that showed sedated beagles with their heads stuck in mesh cages filled with diseased sand flies.\n\nSee, “Answering Questions About #BeagleGate,” Nov. 2, 2021\n\nFauci is among the many federal employees who are required to submit an annual public financial disclosure report to their employing agency or department. His reports — which list his assets, income, employment agreements and other financial information — are available upon request from the NIH’s FOIA office.\n\nBut in a January congressional hearing, Republican Sen. Roger Marshall asked Fauci if he would be willing to publicly release “a financial disclosure form,” suggesting that Fauci’s reports are not available to the public and are being hidden by “the big tech giants.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.heritage.org/public-health/commentary/how-fauci-and-nih-leaders-worked-discredit-covid-19-lab-leak-theory', 'Headline': 'How Fauci and NIH Leaders Worked to Discredit COVID-19 Lab Leak Theory', 'Snippet': 'Collins, the NIH director, echoed these sentiments, saying that without a case for COVID-19’s natural origins, ”the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate, doing great potential harm to ...', 'Full_text': 'House of Representatives investigators just issued an interim report on Tuesday detailing a sophisticated effort by leaders at the National Institutes of Health and a select group of researchers—including those who had received substantial NIH grant funding—to disprove the hypothesis that COVID-19 originated in a Chinese research laboratory and push the narrative that it instead emerged from nature.\n\nRepublican staff of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic chaired by Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, have collected more than 8,000 documents, including emails and other communications, plus nearly 25 hours of witness testimony.\n\nTheir report details the January through March 2020 activities of Dr. Anthony Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins in encouraging an international team of prominent scientists to attempt to debunk the notion that the pandemic could have originated in a lab.\n\nThe Means\n\nFollowing a Feb. 1, 2020, conference call, Fauci and Collins “prompted” the scientists to act. According to the report:\n\nThrough its investigation, the select subcommittee has learned that Dr. Fauci and NIH exerted more influence over the conference call than previously disclosed. Further, by the end of the Feb. 1 conference call, Dr. Fauci had suggested the drafting of a paper regarding the potential of a lab leak to Dr. [Kristian] Andersen twice. This suggestion was what ‘prompted’ Dr. Andersen to draft ‘Proximal Origin.’\n\n“Proximal Origin” refers to “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2,” the paper that ultimately was published in a scientific journal.\n\nThe end of this exercise was not a disinterested scientific effort, but rather an elaborate scheme to create a preferred political narrative that would dominate public discussion of the novel coronavirus. The means was publication in a high-powered, peer-reviewed professional journal that would discredit the “lab leak” theory.\n\nEncouraged by Collins and Fauci, the authors submitted their initial draft to Nature, but the journal turned it down because the editors wanted a stronger dismissal of the lab leak theory. As Andersen testified to the subcommittee, “They thought that we came down too strongly on the side that the virus had been of possible lab origin.”\n\nSo, the authors revised their paper, adding language that the lab origin was implausible, and successfully submitted it to Nature Medicine, part of the Nature portfolio of journals. The finished product—titled “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2”—was published in Nature Medicine on March 17, 2020.\n\nThe Nature Medicine article, according to the subcommittee report, “is one of the single most impactful and influential scientific papers in history, and it expressed conclusions that were not based on sound science nor in fact, but instead on assumptions.”\n\nData Problem\n\nIn arguing for a natural or zoonotic (transferred from animals to humans) origin of the pandemic, the fact that SARS-CoV-2 had certain genetic features not found in previous coronaviruses was a problem, but an even greater difficulty was the absence of hard data. On Jan. 3, 2020, Communist Chinese authorities shut down the sharing of any COVID-19 data or information without government approval.\n\nAs noted in a Senate staff report sponsored by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.:\n\nScientists have not yet succeeded at tracing the origin because they have been denied access to the data that would facilitate a retrospective study of its genomic epidemiology. The epidemiological data released by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) appears to have been curated to create an informational maze that leads to perpetual puzzlement.\n\nTherefore, none of the scientists engaged by Fauci or Collins in February 2020 had, or could have had, access to any hard Chinese data on the novel coronavirus—especially information of an intermediate animal host—that could have proven, or at least strongly supported, the Chinese-endorsed narrative of the zoonotic or natural origin of the pandemic.\n\nSeveral potential candidates for the intermediate animal host, including pangolins and raccoon dogs, have been floated; but to this day, no such host has been identified.\n\nNumerous emails among the multiple authors during the Nature Medicine article’s drafting in February 2020 are especially revealing. Dr. Robert Garry of Tulane University, for example, initially expressed the view that the virus could have been genetically manipulated in a lab. Based on a previous select subcommittee report, he was not alone among this group of virologists in his initial impressions.\n\nAccording to this week’s subcommittee report, Andersen, of Scripps Research Institute, who completed the initial draft, admitted in an email on Feb. 8, 2020:\n\nOur main work over the last couple of weeks has been focused on trying to disprove any type of lab theory, but we are at a crossroad where the scientific evidence isn’t conclusive enough to say that we have high confidence in any of the three main theories considered.\n\nIn a Feb. 11 email, Dr. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University said the paper provided a “plausible argument against genetic engineering,” but it did not close the door on an “inadvertent release” of the virus from the Wuhan lab. It stated:\n\nGiven the scale of the bat Cov [a wide range of bat-borne coronaviruses] research pursued there and the site of its emergence of the first human cases, we have a nightmare of circumstantial evidence to assess.\n\nThen again, on Feb. 20, Andersen—seemingly struggling with the task of refuting a lab origin conclusively—admitted in an email, “We all really, really wish we could do that (that’s how this got started), but unfortunately, it’s just not possible given the data.”\n\nSo, in the absence of scientific data, Andersen and his team proposed a theoretical construct of how SARS-CoV-2 emerged in nature.\n\nMotives\n\nFuture congressional inquiries into this controversy should, of course, focus on the motivation behind this extraordinary effort to disprove the lab leak theory.\n\nBased on the email exchanges among the key participants, this little platoon seemed inordinately obsessed with maintaining good relations with Communist China. In a Feb. 2 email, Dr. Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh wrote:\n\nGiven the s— show that would happen if anyone serious accused the Chinese of even accidental release, my feeling is we should say that given there is no evidence of a specifically engineered virus, we cannot possibly distinguish between natural evolution and escape, so we are content with ascribing it to natural process.\n\nScientists must keep their priorities in order, emphasized Dr. Ron Fouchier, a Dutch virologist: “Further debate about such accusations [of a lab leak] would unnecessarily distract top researchers from their active duties and do unnecessary harm to science in general and science in China in particular.”\n\nCollins, the NIH director, echoed these sentiments, saying that without a case for COVID-19’s natural origins, ”the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate, doing great potential harm to science and international harmony.”\n\nIn short, the email traffic follows the politics.\n\nConcerning Fauci, the subcommittee report simply recounts that he knew at the time, or should have known, that his agency had funded EcoHealth Alliance, a firm engaged in “dangerous experiments” with the Wuhan Institute of Virology; that these coronavirus research activities were conducted with “very little oversight”; that EcoHealth Alliance was not in compliance with the federal government’s grant requirements and failed to report on its work in a timely fashion; and that the Wuhan Institute’s biosafety levels were “substandard”—a fact recently confirmed by the director of national intelligence. Congressional investigators will surely need to probe Fauci’s memory of these matters.\n\nThough the hypothesis of a lab leak as the origin of a pandemic that has killed more than 1.1 million Americans is no longer dismissed today as a “conspiracy theory,” the damage to democratic discourse has been done.\n\nThe Nature Medicine article became the seminal scientific paper that drove the dominant narrative of COVID-19’s natural origins for the past three and half years. It also provided the strongest justification to marginalize alternative scientific opinion.\n\nThat corrosive impact on public discourse was itself a scandal. As New York Times columnist Bret Stephens observed: “The reasons for this—rank partisanship and credulous reporting—and the methods by which it was enforced—censorship and vilification—are reminders that sometimes the most destructive enemies of science can be those who claim to speak in its name.”\n\nEditor’s note: This article was updated on March 25, 2024, to correct the excerpt from Dr. Kristian Andersen’s email of Feb. 8, 2020.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/politics/biden-admin-suspends-wuhan-lab-funding/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden administration suspends funding for Wuhan lab', 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that ...', 'Full_text': 'The Biden administration has suspended funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology following a monthslong review that determined that the Chinese research institute “is not compliant with federal regulations and is not presently responsible,” according to a memo from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHHS, which conducted the review, also proposed barring the Wuhan Institute from doing business with the federal government going forward, according to the memo, which is dated to Monday and was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe lab has not received any federal funding from the US National Institutes of Health since July 2020, according to an HHS spokesperson.\n\nThe determination came after the research institute failed to provide the National Institutes of Health with requested documents amid reported safety concerns at the lab.\n\n“This action aims to ensure that WIV does not receive another dollar of federal funding,” an HHS spokesperson said in a statement. “The move was undertaken due to WIV’s failure to provide documentation on WIV’s research requested by NIH related to concerns that WIV violated NIH’s biosafety protocols.”\n\nIn Monday’s memorandum, HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for acquisition concludes that the Wuhan Institute’s “disregard of the NIH’s requests” and the NIH’s conclusion that the institute’s research likely violated biosafety protocols present a risk that the institute “not only previously violated, but is currently violating, and will continue to violate, protocols of the NIH on biosafety.”\n\n“Therefore, I have determined that the immediate suspension of WIV is necessary to mitigate any potential public health risk,” the official, whose name is redacted, writes in the memo.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology is at the center of a theory that Covid-19 escaped from the lab in late 2019, triggering the global pandemic and nearly 7 million recorded deaths. The virus was first identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report last month that stated the US intelligence community could not determine whether researchers at the lab who fell ill in the fall of 2019 were infected with Covid-19, but identified safety and security issues at the lab. Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/extremely-disconcerting-nih-didnt-track-us-funds-going-to-chinese-virus-research-watchdog-finds-004808475.html', 'Headline': ""NIH didn't track U.S. funds going to Chinese virus research ... - Yahoo"", 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, a new government ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, according to a new government report that is sure to raise new questions about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe report is evidence of “major failures in past NIH oversight of high-risk research on enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” Rutgers molecular biologist Richard Ebright told Yahoo News in an email.\n\nIssued by the inspector general of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the new report says nothing about the origins of the coronavirus. For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners. But he has also conceded that much about how the virus came to be remains unknown.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://fee.org/articles/nihs-letter-to-wuhan-lab-confirms-rand-paul-was-right-and-fauci-was-wrong-about-gain-of-function/', 'Headline': 'NIH’s Letter to Wuhan Lab Confirms Rand Paul Was Right and Fauci Was ...', 'Snippet': 'NIH’s letter to Wuhan comes more than three years after the agency first axed its grant to EcoHealth Alliance, which had been funding Shi’s research, a decision that caused great controversy at the time.

The agency then asked for lab notebooks and other files pertaining to the experiments, and EcoHealth reported that it would relay the request to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the new NIH letters, the Wuhan institute never delivered.\n\n“NIH has requested on two occasions that [EcoHealth] provide NIH the laboratory notebooks and original electronic files from the research conducted at [the Wuhan Institute of Virology]. To date, [the institute] has not provided these records,” Lauer told Comer. NIH verified to the Bulletin that the letters were authentic.\n\nA letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide the requested records, and [EcoHealth’s] failure to include the required terms in [the] subaward agreement represent material failures to comply with the terms of award,” the letter said.\n\nBetween June 2017 and May 2019, scientists working on EcoHealth’s grant tested genetically engineered coronaviruses with the backbone of one virus and the spike proteins—which bind to host cells—of another on mice that expressed human cell receptors. In one case, the NIH reported last fall, one of the chimeric viruses caused mice to become “sicker.” EcoHealth reports show that in the infection experiments, conducted in years four and five of the grant, chimeric viruses replicated faster in mice lungs and killed a higher percentage of mice than the unmodified virus. Last fall, the NIH said that EcoHealth was supposed to report the increased viral growth to the agency “immediately” to assess whether further biosafety measures were necessary.\n\nThe NIH said the Wuhan institute’s experiments under the EcoHealth grant involved viruses that were too genetically distant to have evolved to become SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But some critics of so-called gain-of-function experimentation—in which pathogens are enhanced in way that makes them, say, more transmissible—have said last fall’s revelations point to risky research projects being undertaken at the laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the first reported cases of COVID were reported. Research published recently in Science points to the pandemic having sprung from a seafood market in the city where animals that could have harbored coronavirus infections were kept. That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth has not responded to a request for comment about NIH’s decision to partially terminate its grant.\n\nAccording to the new NIH letters, EcoHealth can work with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to revise the grants without involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If that is not possible, the NIH will ask that the grant be “bilaterally terminated.” Should a reworked grant be possible, the agency will add new terms to it, including increased NIH oversight over EcoHealth for at least three years and increased reporting requirements for the nonprofit. The nonprofit will also be required to visit its sub-awardees every six months to ensure compliance with the grant.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-suspends-federal-funding-wuhan-lab-over-non-compliance-2023-07-19/', 'Headline': 'US suspends federal funding to Wuhan lab over non-compliance', 'Snippet': 'WIV has not received federal funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. medical research agency, since July 2020, according to an HHS statement on Wednesday.', 'Full_text': ''}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/covid-origins-researchers-house-subcommittee-hearing/index.html', 'Headline': 'Scientists at House hearing refute claims they were bribed and ...', 'Snippet': 'Members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei, Province on January 11 ...', 'Full_text': 'Democrats on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic said they aimed to use a hearing Tuesday to set the record straight on Republicans’ claims that Drs. Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins steered scientists investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic away from the idea that the virus was created in a lab in Wuhan, China.\n\nIn a report released in advance of the hearing, Democrats highlighted sworn testimony by authors of the “Proximal Origin” paper that was published in March 2020 in the journal Nature – the paper that first concluded that the pandemic was most likely caused by a viral spillover event from animals to humans.\n\nThat testimony, they said, shows that Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British biomedical scientist who was then director of the Wellcome Trust health research charity and is now chief scientist for the World Health Organization, organized and led the scientific effort that produced both that paper and the February conference call that laid the groundwork for it, rather than Fauci or Collins. Fauci was then head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Collins was head of the National Institutes of Health. Both played critical roles in the nation’s pandemic response.\n\nThe conference call and the paper have become fodder for conspiracy theories claiming that Fauci and Collins pressured scientists to abandon the “lab leak” theory in favor of the natural origins hypothesis.\n\nDr. Kristian Andersen, who studies the genetics of infectious diseases at the Scripps Research Institute, testified Tuesday that in the early days of the pandemic, he first thought the virus that causes Covid-19 had genomic features that might have pointed to laboratory manipulation.\n\n“My initial hypothesis was that SARS-CoV-2 was likely an engineered virus,” Andersen told the committee. “This was based on limited data and preliminary analyses where I had observed features that appeared to be unique.”\n\nHe shared those early concerns with Fauci, who advised him to draft a scientific paper outlining his theory. But Andersen said he changed his mind after learning more about these kinds of viruses.\n\n“We soon discovered that those features are readily found in related coronaviruses, and the virus itself looks to be a clear product of natural selection and not actual engineering,” he said.\n\nHe said scientists often adjust their thinking in the face of evidence. It’s not a flip-flop but how the scientific process works.\n\nAndersen, who said he found his name on online “kill lists” because of allegations that he was part of a coverup, also disputed allegations that he and his co-authors were bribed to change their public statements with promises of grant money.\n\n“It has also been suggested that a grant awarded to myself and colleagues from five different countries was a quid pro quo for changing our conclusions. These allegations are false,” he said.\n\nRepublicans on the committee weren’t happy with those explanations.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican, pressed Andersen to explain the change in his thinking.\n\n“Within a matter of days, something changed,” she said, between Andersen’s emails and calls to Fauci in late January 2020 and the February 1, 2020, conference call with about a dozen other researchers from around the world. “And that’s what this committee is trying to get to the bottom of. What happened within that three-day period between the conference call and the paper that all of a sudden you did a 180, and it couldn’t possibly come from a lab?” she asked. “What happened in those three days?”\n\nDr. Robert Garry, a microbiologist and immunologist at Tulane University, explained that they examined the genomes of other coronaviruses.\n\n“Well, we examined the genomes more closely. We looked at other coronaviruses. And there was some new data that came. There was the data come from the scientific literature,” he said.\n\nGarry said the publication of a similar coronavirus isolated from animals called pangolins showed some of the same changes as the virus that eventually infected humans.\n\n“It was a very important piece of data, because it showed that a lot of the theories about the virus having been engineered or put together in a laboratory were not true, because here was a virus in nature that had a receptor-binding domain with exactly” the same features, he said.\n\nAndersen said the genetic adaptation that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans was “suboptimal,” suggesting to him that it was of natural origin. If the virus had been engineered in a lab, he said, the changes probably would have been more precise.\n\nAndersen also pushed back on the timeline repeated by Republicans on the committee: He said he didn’t change his mind in three days but within about 45 days, as he drafted the Nature paper.\n\nBoth scientists said that if convincing evidence were to emerge that supported the theory that the virus came from lab manipulation, they would consider it.\n\n“It is still my opinion that there is no credible scientific evidence for a lab-based origin for SARS-CoV-2,” Garry said.\n\nRep. John Joyce, a Republican physician from Pennsylvania, asked how some US intelligence agencies – namely the Department of Energy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation – had concluded that the virus probably came from a lab.\n\n“Dr. Andersen, you also said in your testimony, ‘we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,’ and yet two conclusions by the Department of Energy and the FBI directly contradict your position. How do you bring that together?” Joyce said.\n\n“I think you could say that our conclusions completely contradict their conclusions, too,” Andersen said. “I think it’s important to understand that we’re looking at different things here. You’re talking about the intelligence community. If you look at the scientific literature, the scientific evidence for this pointing to a single market in the middle of Wuhan is overwhelming.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Raul Ruiz, an ER doctor who is ranking member of the committee, said that months of the panel’s work had been a biased effort that had shed no additional light on the pandemic’s origins but had sown mistrust in science and the nation’s scientists.\n\n“We have undertaken all of this work, but to what end? Has targeting these researchers and probing the publication of this paper meaningfully advanced our efforts to prevent and prepare for future pandemics?” he asked.\n\n“Or has it been about fishing for evidence to prove their confirmation bias, their theories with a goal of advancing a predetermined partisan narrative targeting Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins and our nation’s scientists and public health officials.”\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, chided her Republican colleagues for feeding public hatred of scientists and public servants.\n\n“I am so offended by some of the things I’ve heard today, of baseless allegations against our nation’s scientists, our public health experts, including Drs.

The pair’s seminal paper in 2005 described how they were able to successfully deliver modified mRNA into the body and trigger an immune response—the kind that trains the immune system for future viral infections. Over the years, their research with mRNA vaccines solved some of the major issues confronting the technique, such as the inflammatory response by the body that involves the production of harmful cytokines. During the pandemic, this mRNA technology led to the production of highly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-causing virus, and particularly ones that were adaptable for large-scale rollout.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

This was “largely due to ... improvements in the technology and this basic discovery.”\n\nKarikó was born in 1955 in Szolnok, Hungary. In 1989 she became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained until 2013. She was a senior vice president at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals—a major manufacturer of an mRNA COVID vaccine—and is now an external consultant for BioNTech. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWeissman was born in 1959 in Lexington, Mass. In 1997 he established his research group at the Perelman School of Medicine. Weissman is Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation.\n\n“The award, to me, is really a victory for vaccines and the potential for vaccines to advance health and improve equity,” says Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccinology professor and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nMany vaccines had been created with weakened or deactivated whole viruses, but in recent decades many researchers have been investigating smaller viral parts, such as viral genetic material: DNA or RNA. When Karikó and Weissman injected the foreign in vitro mRNA into human cells, they found that it created a strong immune reaction that elevated protective antibodies. Subsequent inflammation, as well as enzymes in human blood and cells, would degrade the mRNA, however. Despite these scientific roadblocks, skepticism and difficulties with funding, Karikó and Weissman continued to search for solutions.\n\n“It was nonstop technical hurdles for 25 years,” Weissman reflects. “We couldn’t get funding, Kati [Karikó] kept getting demoted and pushed out. It was very difficult to do this research, but we saw early on the potential and how important RNA was likely to be. And that kept us going. We never gave up.”\n\nThe team found a way to modify mRNA to be less inflammatory—replacing uridine, one of its building block molecules, with a similar molecule called pseudouridine. They also developed a more efficient delivery system that used lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA and help it to enter cells for protein production.\n\n“In the early days of vaccinology, we would take a bacteria, we would take a virus, and we would weaken it, or we would combine it with another antigen. But here this was really a targeted immune system approach, both from the use of the mRNA and the use of the lipid nanoparticle,” Neuzil says. “So, to me, that was quite impressive—that they took an entirely different approach to vaccine delivery.”\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, Karikó and Weissman conducted several animal trials with mRNA vaccines for a variety of different pathogens such as Zika, influenza and HIV. “In every animal model we looked at, HIV was the only one that didn’t work well,” Weissman says. “Just about every single one of them gave us 100 percent protection.”\n\nThe research unlocked a new path for possible therapy and vaccine development—one that would prove critical during the COVID pandemic.\n\nAdapting for a Global Public Health Emergency\n\nWhen SARS-CoV-2 began to spread worldwide, Weissman and Karikó’s mRNA research quickly became a candidate and basis for vaccines against the virus. The mRNA vaccine approach had several advantages, Weissman explains. Only a sequence of the original pathogen was needed rather than an actual piece or full virus. “There’s no growing a virus and inactivating it. It’s a very simple procedure, and that’s because it’s a simple enzymatic reaction,” Weissman says. “It was two months from the sequence being released to the first patients getting the vaccine.”\n\nClinical trials, production and rollout of the vaccines greatly expanded, with companies creating hundreds of millions of doses within a year. “Switching over to COVID, it was just a technical thing,” Karikó told Scientific American in a 2021 interview. “It was already ready.”\n\nThe mRNA COVID vaccines work by injecting the genetic material specifically for SARS-CoV-2’s spike proteins—surface proteins on the virus that allow it to bind to healthy cells. Modified mRNA in the vaccine is taken by cells, which then decode it and produce those spike proteins so that the immune system can better identify and neutralize the real virus in the event of a future infection.\n\n“We’re coming off the worst pandemic in more than a century, and certainly these vaccines contributed to lives saved and to less morbidity,” says Neuzil, who has also been working on mRNA vaccines for malaria. “I think an adaptation of this technology and mRNA vaccines could really be transformative, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, because of the adaptability and flexibility of the platform.”\n\nFuture Therapies\n\nFor future vaccines, the application can be quite broad, Weissman says. When Karikó first became interested in mRNA research, she wasn’t initially seeking to develop vaccines. “I was making this modification in the RNA because I always wanted to develop it for therapies,” she told Scientific American in 2021.\n\nWhile the mRNA technology has helped to tackle the COVID pandemic, a tremendous number of people will benefit from the technology, says Niek Sanders, a principal investigator at Ghent University’s Laboratory of Gene Therapy in Belgium. “It can also be used to treat any disease that is due to a malfunctioning protein as it allows patients produce their own therapeutic proteins,” Sanders says. “Nobel Prizes with such a high impact on society are rare and occur only once in 25 or 50 years.”\n\nWeissman, Karikó and other research groups are already trying to apply the technology to autoimmune diseases, cancers, food and environmental allergies, bacterial diseases and insect-borne diseases. In July Weissman and his colleagues published a paper in Science that showed they could deliver RNA gene-editing machinery directly to bone marrow stem cells. This could be key for treating diseases such as sickle cell anemia, in which stem cells are typically taken from an individual, cultured and treated, and then put back into the body. “Now we can give them an off-the-shelf injection of RNA and cure their disease, and that has applicability to thousands of other bone marrow diseases. And then you can expand that to liver, to lung, to brain, to every other organ therapeutics,” Weissman says. “The potential is just enormous.”\n\nWeissman hopes that the mRNA treatment will be available to sickle cell anemia patients in a year and a half. He also has many mRNA clinical trials underway, including a phase 1 trial for the disease amyloidosis and vaccine trials for HIV, norovirus and malaria. Wiessman’s team is also planning to start clinical trials soon on a pan-coronavirus mRNA vaccine, which could help prevent future coronavirus epidemics.\n\n“The future is now,” Weissman says. “These therapeutics are in people right now.”""}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-10-02/kariko-weissman-mrna-covid-vaccine-nobel-prize', 'Headline': 'Scientists whose work paved way for COVID vaccines win Nobel - Los ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists whose work on mRNA paved the way for first COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel Prize. Dr. Drew Weissman, left, a physician-scientist, and biochemist Katalin Karikó won the Nobel Prize in ...', 'Full_text': 'Katalin Karikó and Dr. Drew Weissman, American scientists whose long collaboration has revolutionized the making of vaccines and raised the prospect of new treatments for a range of afflictions, were awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine Monday for their work on messenger RNA.\n\nHungarian-born biochemist Karikó, 68, spent nearly a decade at BioNTech, the German pharmaceutical firm that collaborated with drug giant Pfizer to produce the COVID-19 pandemic’s first vaccine against the virus that causes COVID-19. Physician-scientist Weissman, 64, is a professor of vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nTheir work has armed scientists and drug companies with the means to turn the body’s cells into manufacturers of its own medicine.\n\n“This year’s Nobel Prize recognizes their basic science discovery that fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with the immune system and had a major impact on society during the recent pandemic,” said Rickard Sandberg, a member of the Nobel Assembly, noting that mRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 shots, “have been administered over 13 billion times.”\n\nThomas Perlmann, the secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly, said both Karikó and Weissman were “overwhelmed” when he notified them of the award, especially Karikó, given her tumultuous professional history.\n\n“Ten years ago, she told me that she was terminated from her current position and had to move to Germany for another position without her family and so forth,” Perlmann said. “So it’s been a dramatic change in her circumstances.”\n\nAlthough mRNA rose to public prominence for its use in COVID-19 vaccines, the technology is expected to become a major basis for flu vaccines, enabling shorter lead times and more accurate matching between circulating influenza strains and yearly shots.\n\nBeyond that, it could play a key role in treating sickle-cell disease and shows promise for the autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis. Its potential use in treating cancers is also opening new avenues for arming the immune system against malignancy.\n\nHIV could be the next target. Three new experimental vaccines to protect against HIV infection, all based on an mRNA design similar to that used in the COVID-19 jab, are now undergoing early human clinical trials.\n\nThe techniques pioneered by Karikó and Weissman have enabled scientists to nimbly customize the proteins targeted by vaccines, a key for thwarting shape-shifting viruses such as the coronavirus and HIV.\n\nSuch capabilities more than proved their worth during the pandemic. The mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were both designed within weeks of the release of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome, and were the first to come off manufacturing lines for worldwide use. Today, the two COVID-19 vaccines are in use in at least 164 countries, and roughly 270 million Americans have received at least one dose.\n\nThat “impressive success story” alone would make recognition of Karikó and Weissman by the Nobel Committee “proper and appropriate,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to President Biden. But advances the pair made in the use of mRNA have only begun to be felt in medicine, he added.\n\nKarikó was first introduced to ribonucleic acid, or RNA, in 1978 and said she’s been “passionate about this fragile molecule ever since.” She was exploring DNA’s use of messenger RNA to deliver specific work orders to cells when she met Weissman over a photocopy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1997.\n\nAntiretroviral medications were just entering wide use against HIV/AIDS at the time, and Weissman was trying to design a vaccine against a disease that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. He had been intrigued by the possibility that mRNA could induce cells to produce proteins that the body was missing or that it needed to heal itself. But he knew that efforts to repurpose this delicate nucleic acid for medical purposes had hit a host of stumbling blocks.\n\nKarikó was intimately familiar with the obstacles to mRNA’s use. And she was well aware of the skepticism directed its way by the scientific community. After earning a doctorate in biochemistry at Hungary’s University of Szeged and immigrating to the United States in 1985, she had been determined to find ways to harness mRNA for treatments.\n\nBy the time she met Weissman, Karikó had been an itinerant postdoctoral researcher for more than a decade. At Temple University in Philadelphia, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., and the University of Pennsylvania, she had tried to drum up support for work on mRNA’s biomedical uses. She had a drawer full of rejected grant proposals to show for it.\n\nWeissman’s research pedigree was more promising. A biochemistry major at Brandeis University, Weissman earned his medical degree and a doctorate at Boston University and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship in Fauci’s lab at the National Institutes of Health. While there, he studied a key node of the mammalian immune system — dendritic cells — and their perturbation in HIV/AIDS.\n\nWeissman knew that messenger RNA had an incidental effect on dendritic cells: Their interaction touched off an immune response that ignited dangerous inflammation across the body.\n\nWeissman and Karikó both realized that until that problem could be fixed, mRNA would be of limited biomedical use, and no use at all in making vaccines. There was also the problem of mRNA’s fragility outside of cells: Unpackaged, it was easily chewed up by enzymes, and getting it through cells’ outer walls was no picnic either.\n\nThe two scientists formed a partnership of grit and grace. Over more than two decades, Karikó’s and Weissman’s experiments shed more light on how mRNA could be repurposed to enter cells and safely order up the production of certain proteins. They watched how other nucleic acids snuck past the immune system unnoticed and devised a fix that enabled mRNA to ferry new work orders into cells without causing flares of inflammation.\n\n“Each spark of something interesting, whether a finding we expected — or even more exciting, the ones we didn’t — motivated us to continue,” Weissman said in a speech accepting the 2021 Lasker Award, one of several prestigious scientific honors the pair have won in recent years.\n\n“Together we designed and conducted experiments, often trading emails into the early hours — unable to wait until the next day to share particular findings or ideas,” Weissman said. “We just kept at it.”\n\nBy 2004, the two had produced a paper that detailed their success at reengineering mRNA for use in mammals. In an interview with the journal Cell, the two recalled that their first paper together was rejected by the three premier science journals — Cell, Science and Nature. One reviewer dismissed the work as a mere “incremental improvement” over existing research in the area.\n\nKarikó said she had to look up “incremental” in the dictionary. Undeterred, the pair got their paper published in a specialty journal, Immunity, in 2005. Then they waited for the conference invitations to pour in.\n\n“We sat and stared at the phone, and nothing happened,” Weissman said. After presenting the paper at one conference, Karikó said a fellow scientist came up and asked who had supervised her work — the kind of question no one would ask a man of her age.\n\nNot until 2010, after the pair published findings that further improved the prospects for mRNA’s use, did the medical establishment start to take notice. By 2012, Weismann and Karikó led a team that showed that mRNA, introduced into mice, could prompt the temporary production of red blood cells.\n\n“They had to do some really fancy manipulation to allow it to persist long enough” inside the body to ferry genetic instructions into cells, Fauci said. “They were persistent, resilient, and they stuck to it,” he added. “It’s a great example of the scientific process.”\n\nIn 2013, Karikó left the University of Pennsylvania to join BioNTech, reasoning that pharmaceutical companies would eclipse universities in devising treatments using mRNA technology.\n\nWhen the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in China in 2019, BioNTech had already used mRNA technology to design a vaccine against the Zika virus, which had infected hundreds of thousands of pregnant women and caused grievous birth defects across the world. Moderna, too, had been working on a Zika vaccine, as well as vaccines against cytomegalovirus infection and cancers.\n\nWithin two weeks of the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ genetic sequence, both companies had what they needed to build a vaccine. They used different formulations for the delivery of mRNA, but once inside a human cell, the vaccines provided the genetic specifications for producing harmless replicas of the coronavirus’ spike proteins. The human immune system would take it from there.\n\nWhen health officials in the U.S. and United Kingdom ordered up a new crop of COVID-19 booster shots that targeted the Omicron variant, all Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna had to do was insert a key piece of genetic code that matched the desired strains. The updated shots were ready in mere months.\n\nWeissman has established laboratories in Thailand, South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries to devise COVID-19 vaccines that can be produced locally. His research continues to explore ways for mRNA vaccines to provide more enduring protection against COVID-19 by training the immune system to recognize pieces of the virus that are much less prone to mutation.\n\nIn addition, Weissman has joined with other scientists to counter the misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 shots that has made many people unwilling to roll up their sleeves.\n\n“As important as the vaccine is, if you don’t take it, it doesn’t work,” he said in an interview Monday with nobelprize.org, adding that the endorsement from the Nobel committee might help sway some of those who have been hesitant.\n\nHe remains at the University of Pennsylvania, and is married to Mary Ellen Weissman. They have two daughters, Rachel and Allison.\n\nKarikó left BioNTech in 2022 but is still a consultant for the company. She is now a research professor at the University of Szeged and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nKarikó is married to Béla Francia, who she said encouraged her decision to commute to BioNTech in Germany when she lost her position at Penn. The couple and their daughter, Zsuzsanna “Susan” Francia, arrived in the United States in 1985 with their life savings — about $1,000 — sewn into the stuffing of a teddy bear. (Susan Francia grew up to become a decorated rower, winning two Olympic gold medals for the United States.)\n\n“I try to tell fellow female scientists that you don’t have to choose between having a family, you can have it,” she told nobelprize.org on Monday. “Your child will watch you and they will do, because that’s what counts, the example that you present.”\n\nThrough it all, Karikó has said she was not deterred by her lack of funding, the lack of interest from the medical establishment or the slow pace at which she and Weissman uncovered mRNA’s secrets.\n\n“I am so glad it helped humanity,” Karikó told a University of Pennsylvania interviewer. But for decades, the process of scientific discovery was its own reward, she added.\n\n“So many enigmatic things about RNA I find very, very exciting,” Karikó said. She and Weissman would ask questions and then design experiments to answer them.\n\n“And of course, instead of the answer, we got 100 more questions,” she added. “It was very enjoyable. I would like to emphasize that to be a scientist is a joy.”'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/02/1202941256/nobel-prize-goes-to-scientists-who-made-mrna-covid-vaccines-possible', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize goes to scientists who made mRNA COVID vaccines possible', 'Snippet': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.', 'Full_text': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nKatalin Karikó and Drew Weissman met at copy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and collaborated for decades to try to find ways to use genetic material called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to make vaccines.\n\nThe scientists discovered that modifying a chemical building block of mRNA kept the immune system from destroying the material and enabled it to instead stimulate protection against viruses.

Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020. And that success is seeding mRNA-based strategies across a number of different conditions, including other infectious diseases as well as cancer.\n\nKariko’s husband answered the call from Stockholm early in the morning on Oct. 2 at their home in a Philadelphia suburb. She told nobelprize.org that she initially thought “somebody was just joking.” While she said the conversation involved detailed scientific information that would have been hard to fake, “you never know in these days,” she said.\n\nTrue to their long-time partnership, Kariko then called Weissman to break the good news. In fact, the early morning call likely reminded him of years of similar emails he and Kariko would exchange at dawn when they were working to crack the problem of turning mRNA into reliable therapies.\n\nThat collaboration began at the copy machine between their offices at the University of Pennsylvania. Kariko was obsessed with mRNA, which is the part of DNA that codes for proteins, convinced that it would be the key to developing new treatments for heart disease, stroke and other conditions. Few scientists at the time agreed, since RNA was much less stable than DNA, and despite years of dedicated, unflagging research, Kariko had little to show in the form of results.\n\nThen came the chance meeting with Weissman at the copier in 1997. Weissman is an immunologist and physician and had come to Penn from the National Institutes of Health to continue developing a vaccine against HIV. The more gregarious Kariko tried to sell her colleague on the merits of mRNA, and Weissman listened.\n\nTo make mRNA a useful tool for treating people, however, Kariko needed to find a way to suppress its tendency to aggravate the immune system, which ended up creating a dangerous inflammatory reaction and destroying the very mRNA that was supposed to be therapeutic. Their personalities couldn\'t be more different—according to Kariko, Weissman said she tended to zig and zag to generate ideas, while he preferred the more straightforward approach. Still, “we worked side by side,"" said Weissman. But their research wasn\'t popular, either with the leadership at the university, or with the scientific community. ""We couldn’t get funding [for our research] we couldn’t get publications [for our work], we couldn’t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,” Weissman said during a press briefing after the Nobel announcement. “RNA had failed in clinical trials, and pretty much everybody had given up on it.”\n\nBut the over the next decade or so, Kariko and Weissman tenaciously proved the doubters wrong. They eventually figured out that changing one portion of the mRNA code would make it less likely to stimulate the immune system. Not only that, the change also led cells in animals to produce more of the desired protein coded for by the mRNA—exactly what they needed to turn mRNA into a robust vaccine or other treatment.\n\nBut even when the scientists published what they thought was their ground-breaking finding in 2005, the scientific community barely noticed. Doubters still prevailed, and Kariko was “kicked out from Penn, and forced to retire,” she said. Eventually, she was hired by BioNTech, a German biotech that shared Kariko’s vision about the promise of mRNA technology. When reached for comment, a spokesperson at Penn did not directly address the circumstances of Kariko\'s leaving the university.\n\nThat faith was finally borne out when two mRNA-based vaccines, including one made by BioNTech and Pfizer and another by U.S. biotech Moderna, became the first to be authorized and approved to treat SARS-CoV-2, and remain the foundation for the pandemic response. Kariko’s conviction was finally justified—more than two decades later—that mRNA would make an efficient, and potentially more powerful platform for treating disease. Now, researchers are developing mRNA-based vaccines to target other infectious diseases such as mpox and influenza, and the strategy is even showing promise against cancer, as a way to train the immune system to recognize tumors. Because the technology is still so new, scientists are still learning about any side effects of the platform—mRNA vaccines have so far been linked to a slightly higher risk of some heart inflammation, for example—but given that millions of people have received the shots, so far the benefits appear to outweigh the risks.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03119-x', 'Headline': 'mRNA COVID vaccines saved lives and won a Nobel - Nature', 'Snippet': 'COVID advances win US$3-million Breakthrough prizes. “This is a perfect use of mRNA,” says Rossi, who co-founded a company called Intellia Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that is ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/nobel-prize-medicine-1.6984244', 'Headline': 'Scientists who spurred development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving ...', 'Full_text': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries they made at the University of Pennsylvania that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving body said on Monday.\n\nKariko and Weissman were honoured for ""their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19,"" the body said.\n\n""MRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 vaccines, have been administered over 13 billion times.

""Pretty much everybody gave up on it.""\n\nMessenger or mRNA, discovered in 1961, is a natural molecule that serves as a recipe for the body\'s production of proteins.\n\nThe technology breaks from established biotech medicines, generated in complex reactors by genetically modified living cells, then isolated and purified.

The rapid development of these vaccines changed the course of the pandemic, providing protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nBut these vaccines would not have been possible it if weren’t for the pioneering work of this year’s winners of the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine decades earlier.\n\nDr Katalin Karikó and Dr Drew Weissman, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, have been given the prestigious award for their discoveries into mRNA biology. The pair were the first to discover a way of modifying mRNA that allowed it to successfully be delivered to cells and replicated by them.\n\nTheir discovery was not only integral to COVID-19 vaccine development, but may also lead to the development of many other therapies – such as vaccines for cancer.\n\nLife’s work\n\nKarikó is a Hungarian biochemist and Weissman an American physician scientist. The two began working together in 1985 when Karikó was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, where Weissman was already working as an immunologist. They had a shared interest in how mRNA could be used to make new therapies.\n\nMessenger RNA (better known as mRNA) is an essential molecule to life. It’s made in the body from our very own DNA in a process called translation. DNA is our special encoded handbook of instructions for manufacturing proteins, which are the building blocks for material in the body.\n\nOur mRNA copies and carries these genetic instructions from our DNA to our cells. The cells then make whatever protein they’ve been instructed to, such as haemoglobin which helps red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.\n\nKarikó and Weissman thought that if it was possible to commandeer this process, mRNA could be used to instruct cells to essentially make their own cures. But at the time they started working together, attempts by other researchers to do this had been unsuccessful.\n\nThe researchers faced two major challenges as they began their work. The first was being able to prevent the host from mounting an immune response against the modified mRNA. The second was being able to deliver the mRNA into the host safely without it degrading.\n\nTo understand how they overcame the first barrier, it’s important to understand mRNA’s structure. Normally, mRNA molecules contain four types of smaller molecules known as bases (nucleosides): A (adenine), U (uridine), G (guanine), and C (cytosine). Different sequences of these bases can be strung together to produce the basis of an mRNA molecule.\n\nIn early experiments, Karikó and Weismann found that injecting normal mRNA molecules into mice led to an immune response. This meant the mouse’s immune system saw the new mRNA as an invading pathogen and the immune cells would destroy it, instead of replicating it.\n\nSo the researchers modified the U nucleoside to create a pseudouridine, a chemical compound which stabilises RNA’s structure. When they repeated their experiment with the modified mRNA, the mice exhibited no immune response.\n\nBut Karikó and Weismann still faced the second challenge of being able to deliver the bespoke mRNA without it degrading.\n\nThey decided to use lipids (a nanoparticle) to deliver it. These fatty chemical compounds are an essential part of the cell membrane, controlling what enters and leaves the cell. Specially created lipids allowed the mRNA molecules to be delivered without being degraded or broken down by the immune system.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s research had successfully eliminated the obstacles that had previously stood in the way of using mRNA clinically. Being able to instruct the body to replicate virtually any harmless protein could have potential for treating a range of diseases and even protect against viral infections.\n\nCOVID vaccines\n\nWhen their research was first published, it didn’t garner much attention. But in 2011, two biotech companies – Moderna and BioNTech – took notice and began research into mRNA medicines.\n\nIt’s no wonder why. Traditional vaccine production methods are time consuming, expensive and don’t work for every vaccine. But Karikó and Weissman’s work showed that synthetic mRNA could be made at a large scale.\n\nResearchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest. But in 2020, when COVID-19 began spreading around the globe, vaccines were needed quickly to offer protection.\n\nUsing the foundational work of Karikó and Weissman, scientists developed a bespoke mRNA sequence which mimicked the spike protein (which allows the virus to enter our cells). This produced a harmless COVID particle which our cells then replicated, allowing our bodies to protect us from severe COVID infections when it encountered the real virus.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s discoveries years earlier were critical in making the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines possible. But these aren’t the only ways their work could be applied.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.wired.com/story/mrna-vaccine-revolution-katalin-kariko/', 'Headline': 'Katalin Karikó’s Nobel Prize Marks the Beginning of an mRNA Vaccine ...', 'Snippet': 'Nobel Prize winners Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman pioneered the technology that produced a Covid-19 vaccine in record time. Next, mRNA could tackle flu, malaria, and HIV.', 'Full_text': 'No one expected the first Covid-19 vaccine to be as good as it was. “We were hoping for around 70 percent, that’s a success,” says Dr Ann Falsey, a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester, New York, who ran a 150-person trial site for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in 2020.\n\nEven Uğur Şahin, the co-founder and CEO of BioNTech, who had shepherded the drug from its earliest stages, had some doubts. All the preliminary laboratory tests looked good; having seen them, he would routinely tell people that “immunologically, this is a near-perfect vaccine.” But that doesn’t always mean it will work against “the beast, the thing out there” in the real world. It wasn’t until November 9, 2020, three months into the final clinical trial, that he finally got the good news. “More than 90 percent effective,” he says. “I knew this was a game changer. We have a vaccine.”\n\n“We were overjoyed,” Falsey says. “It seemed too good to be true. No respiratory vaccine has ever had that kind of efficacy.”\n\nThe arrival of a vaccine before the close of 2020 was an unexpected turn of events. Early in the pandemic, the conventional wisdom was that, even with all the stops pulled, a vaccine would take at least a year and a half to develop. Talking heads often referenced that the previous fastest-ever vaccine developed, for mumps back in 1967, took four years. Modern vaccines often stretch out past a decade of development. BioNTech—and US-based Moderna, which announced similar results later the same week—shattered that conventional timeline.\n\nNeither company was a household name before the pandemic. In fact, neither had ever had a single drug approved before. But both had long believed that their mRNA technology, which uses simple genetic instructions as a payload, could outpace traditional vaccines, which rely on the often-painstaking assembly of living viruses or their isolated parts. mRNA turned out to be a vanishingly rare thing in the world of science and medicine: a promising and potentially transformative technology that not only survived its first big test, but delivered beyond most people’s wildest expectations.\n\nBut its next step could be even bigger. The scope of mRNA vaccines always went beyond any one disease. Like moving from a vacuum tube to a microchip, the technology promises to perform the same task as traditional vaccines, but exponentially faster, and for a fraction of the cost. “You can have an idea in the morning, and a vaccine prototype by evening. The speed is amazing,” says Daniel Anderson, an mRNA therapy researcher at MIT. Before the pandemic, charities including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) hoped to turn mRNA on deadly diseases that the pharmaceutical industry has largely ignored, such as dengue or Lassa fever, while industry saw a chance to speed up the quest for long-held scientific dreams: an improved flu shot, or the first effective HIV vaccine.\n\nAmesh Adalja, an expert on emerging diseases at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in Maryland, says mRNA could “make all these applications we were hoping for, pushing for, become part of everyday life.”\n\n“When they write the history of vaccines, this will probably be a turning point,” he adds.\n\nThe race for the next generation of mRNA vaccines—targeted at a variety of other diseases—is already exploding. Moderna has over two dozen vaccine candidates in development or clinical trials; BioNTech a further eight. There are at least six mRNA vaccines against flu in the pipeline, and a similar number against HIV. Nipah, Zika, herpes, dengue, hepatitis, and malaria vaccines have all been announced. The field sometimes resembles the early stage of a gold rush, with pharma giants snapping up promising researchers for huge contracts—Sanofi paid $425 million (£307m) to partner with a small American mRNA biotech called Translate Bio in 2021, while GSK paid $294 million (£212m) to work with Germany’s CureVac. Even Moderna and BioNTech, buoyed by the success of their Covid vaccines, have started to buy up companies to help with product development.\n\n“Biotech generally doesn’t have as much disruption as the computer tech industry—development times are long, it’s heavily regulated. So you can usually see change coming,” says Hartaj Singh, an industry analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. “Covid turned that on its head; mRNA vaccines quickly came out as the big winner. Lots of older vaccine platforms will be gone—replaced—in a few years, or at least greatly diminished.”\n\nŞahin would go further. “It will be transformative, there’s no question. It will be absolutely transformative. Many older vaccine platforms will not survive.” But, he says, the impact will go beyond what we already know. “There are so many more things we can do. This is not just a replacement; we will be coming up with other new medical innovations that wouldn’t otherwise be possible.”\n\nNot everyone was so surprised that mRNA vaccines passed their first test with flying colors. Katalin Karikó, a Hungarian biochemist, started working with mRNA as early as 1989; her research at the University of Pennsylvania in the mid-2000s laid the foundation for both the BioNTech and Moderna vaccines (Karikó is a consultant on RNA pharmaceuticals for BioNTech, and was previously a senior vice president at the company). On October 2 2023, she and immunologist Drew Weissman were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on mRNA technology.\n\nKarikó is one of the nerve centres of the mRNA world. She is an inveterate scientist, peppering conversations with references in academic format—name, experiment, year—and constantly looking to the next frontier. She was deeply impressed with the scale of the Covid vaccine rollout, but seems almost impatient with how long it took people to come around to her fascination with mRNA. The science always said it would “work like a charm,” she says, rattling off small-scale studies from the past two decades.\n\nThe concept behind mRNA as a drug is strikingly simple: it is the molecule that your own cells use to carry instructions from your genes, written in a simple four-letter chemical language. If you can synthesize it in a lab and deliver it to cells, you can theoretically tell them to make a specific tool—a viral antigen, or a cancer-blocking molecule, or more heart tissue—all in their own language. Moderna has taken to calling mRNA therapies the “software of life,” or an “operating system” for medicine.\n\nBut, like so many other theoretically attractive propositions in science, it was stacked with practical problems. The body violently rejects RNA from outside sources—probably to avoid being hijacked by viruses and other pathogens—and often the RNA proved so toxic that it killed the lab animals it was tested on. “We couldn’t dream of using it on humans,” Karikó says. For years, this was such a major obstacle that few scientists even considered using it for vaccines. “It was so theoretical at that time, no-one was really doing this stuff,” says Dr David Scales, an assistant professor of medicine at Cornell University who worked with Karikó as a student.\n\nWorking with Weissman at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 2000s, Karikó engineered synthetic mRNA molecules that could avoid the body’s defenses. It was a painstaking process that, Weissman says, killed a lot of mice before they finally found the successful formula. But in 2004, one of her constructs worked. In effect, this opened the lines of communication between our cells and mRNA messages created by scientists.\n\nKarikó always believed mRNA could do anything. “For years I was going to scientific meetings and approaching people to say, ‘What are you working on? Maybe this RNA technology could help’—whatever it was, a disease, baldness even. They probably all thought I was crazy,” she says, laughing.\n\n“She was so passionate about the things that RNA could do,” Scales says. “She was an evangelist and a translator. She helped you think about all the possibilities.”\n\nNearly 20 years later, the vaccines enabled by her work have turned Karikó into a scientific celebrity—something that will only ratchet up following her Nobel. That bit, the fame, she says, “does make me nervous.” Requests for interviews encroach on her work. And more important than any plaudits is the fact that thousands of scientists have now come around to her way of thinking.\n\nUnlike the early days of mRNA research, we won’t be waiting decades for its next big test. The pandemic has put it in the spotlight, and scientists are eager to find out if its success against coronavirus can be replicated.\n\nThe next big mRNA vaccine breakthrough probably won’t be against another exotic new disease, but a very familiar one. “Flu is the number one target,” Falsey says. A disease that most people consider under control, influenza still kills over 300,000 people worldwide most years. This is despite more than one billion yearly flu shots. “The vaccines aren’t as effective as we want them to be,” she says.\n\nThat may be putting it mildly. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which tracks the efficacy of the vaccine in the US every year, they rarely achieve even 50 percent protection. For the 2018-2019 flu season it was just 29 percent; some years it is as low as 10 percent. Scientific papers, not usually prone to expressive language, often refer to an improved flu vaccine as the “holy grail” of the field.\n\nOne scientist chasing that dream is Norbert Pardi, who works in Katalin Karikó’s old department at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was recruited by Karikó in 2011. (He is also from Hungary, and proudly shows me a black-and-white picture of his grandfather alongside Karikó’s father in a small-town butcher shop.) His main project, stretching back to before the coronavirus pandemic, targets flu. “The seasonal vaccine simply isn’t very good; we can make a better one.”\n\nThe problem with current flu vaccines lies in the mismatch between the elusive nature of the influenza virus and the rather antiquated and slow method we use to make a vaccine against it—a process mRNA seems tailor-made to replace. The illness we call flu is caused by several different species of the influenza virus, and each species is highly mutable (meaning it can change very rapidly). This means a new vaccine is required each year against the deadliest strains, and even as the vaccine is being made, the virus continues mutating. The former head of vaccination for the CDC, Bruce Gellin, calls it a “moving target,” and says a vaccine that is a good match early in the year might be evaded a few months later.\n\nThis would seem to require a rapidly adaptable and changeable vaccine—and the seasonal flu vaccine is not that. The first commercial flu vaccine was licensed in the US in 1945, and we make it nearly the very same way today. The vaccine is made by growing the target flu virus strains in fertilized hens’ eggs, then purifying it from their whites—a process just as messy as it sounds. The viruses are then chemically inactivated, and shot into patients’ arms. The whole thing is slow, taking several months from ID-ing the target strains to growing the eggs to harvesting the vaccine.\n\nNot every vaccine is made this way—so-called “killed-virus” vaccines are the oldest of the old school. For most pathogens, this approach has long since been supplanted by a technology called recombinant protein vaccines, where a single piece of the virus—a viral protein—is grown in a laboratory. If the right target is chosen, just that single piece can prime the immune system as effectively as a whole virus—with significantly less mess.\n\nBut they have their own downsides. Proteins are complex molecules, and they can be tough to grow in a laboratory. “I spent a lot of time as a biochemist purifying proteins; they can be very complicated, very particular,” Pardi says.\n\nmRNA does away with all of this. It has sometimes been described in the press as “turning your body into a vaccine factory,” but that suggests a sort of coercive power. Your body is already a wondrous protein factory. A million times more efficient than any lab on Earth, its cells make trillions of proteins for normal bodily function every single day. An mRNA vaccine is just a tiny genetic instruction in the factory’s native language—a work order to add a few little viral proteins to the queue. “Your cells are constantly doing this anyway. We’re just hijacking this process a little to make the viral protein we want the immune system to recognize,” explains Anna Blakney, an RNA researcher at the University of British Columbia.\n\nThis gives mRNA a massive speed advantage over traditional methods, meaning the flu virus would have less time to mutate before a vaccine arrives. “The lead time to make the vaccine is so much shorter. You could make a huge batch in two weeks. You could even have multiple different flu vaccines across the winter if it changes in real time,” Blakney says.\n\n“We can get in front of it every season,” says Şahin. BioNTech’s flu vaccine is currently in Phase 3 human trials, being tested for efficacy in 25,000 people.\n\nA more effective flu vaccine would already be a big step, but Pardi and his group are reaching beyond that, trying to create a vaccine that targets the core, unchangeable structures of the influenza virus. “A universal vaccine, one shot that would last for years,” he says. Decades of research suggest many likely targets on the influenza virus for such a vaccine, but targeting multiple sites across multiple influenza strains quickly ramps up the complexity and costs for the traditional approach. Not so with mRNA, says Pardi: “We can easily have 12 or 14 targets in a single shot. Four proteins, and their variants, in multiple strains.”\n\nPardi’s group and their collaborators have already demonstrated good results for a vaccine in mice and ferrets—with human testing now in sight. It’s possible that if their universal vaccine works out, it won’t compete with traditional flu vaccines but with the mRNA-based seasonal vaccines that BioNTech and Moderna are testing now. “For many years we had to convince people this technology was viable—the world has totally changed in that respect,” he says. Like Karikó, he’s happy to see more scientists piling in. “We like to see that. In the next few years we will learn a lot about how the technology works.”\n\nInfluenza is an obvious target for mRNA, says Dr Lynda Stuart, deputy director for vaccines at the Gates Foundation. She expects the platform will “transform flu vaccines,” and that there are many other vaccines that it could improve or replace. But beyond that, it could also help with what she calls the “real, hard, intractable problems and diseases.” Because the platform can produce new RNA so quickly and cheaply, “you don’t have to go through this long process of manufacturing with every idea. It becomes quicker to test them. We can get to new ideas faster.”\n\nPerhaps no virus has proved harder or more intractable than HIV. “We are nearly 40 years on from the discovery of HIV,” Mark Feinberg, head of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, says, and despite advancements in treatments and prophylaxis, a cure is “not close.” There are a thicket of problems. HIV is a long-term infection—hiding quietly inside our cells rather than fighting an immediate, pitched battle with the immune system, like Covid-19 or the flu. It mutates unbelievably quickly, often creating multiple variants inside a single patient, so it doesn’t have a single, stable target to aim a vaccine at. One biochemist described the coronavirus spike protein to me as a “juicy target,” which is why so many different vaccines work against it. “A spike gets a very good immune response. HIV proteins not so much,” Feinberg says.\n\nBut scientists believe they have a roadmap to a vaccine. As Derek Cain, professor at the Human Vaccine Institute at Duke University, explains, a small fraction of people with long-term HIV infections do eventually develop what are called “broadly neutralizing antibodies” against the virus, capable of stopping it before it enters cells. At that point in the disease, he says, those antibodies are like “a fire extinguisher against a four-alarm house fire.” They can’t reverse the infection on their own. But if a person newly exposed to HIV had the same antibodies, “suddenly it’s a fire extinguisher against a match,” and the infection could be halted.\n\nIt is as if those patients’ immune system is a coach that hit on a winning strategy in the waning minutes of a match, too late to help their own team. But, Cain says, “We can recreate that fight with a series of vaccinations,” by showing an untested immune system vaccine snapshots of the same HIV infections that progressed over years in the other patients. It will take lots of trial and error, multiple vaccinations and fine-tuning—what Stuart calls potentially “swarms of vaccines, with many targets.”\n\nUsing traditional vaccine methods, this would be a massive war of scientific attrition. Feinberg says that, with protein-based vaccines, “the interval between having an idea and getting into a trial could easily be two years.”\n\n“It’s hard to fathom having to go through this process for every immunogen, every target,” says Cain. But RNA can not only be made quicker, because it’s just the chemical signal rather than a protein itself—it also always has the same ingredients. It doesn’t need a new set of lengthy safety tests before going to trial. “You can go from a sequence to getting a vaccine into the clinic in an unprecedented short time. It would allow us to move much more quickly,” says Feinberg.\n\nSuddenly, the scientific timeline for this incredibly ambitious project is compressed by years—decades even, says Cain. “The million dollar question is still whether this will work,” Cain says, but the mRNA approach could return an answer far sooner than anyone thought possible just a few years ago. “That scale was unimaginable before. We’re at a very exciting point,” says Feinberg.\n\nThe same story is playing out across hundreds of different scientific fields. 2020 opened the floodgates. It isn’t just that the Covid-19 vaccines validated mRNA as a scientific approach; the vaccine rollout also built up a vast regulatory and manufacturing network for a brand-new technology in under a year. In a sense, Covid built the infrastructure for the mRNA future. Researchers had always promised it would be cleaner and faster than traditional methods, but now companies are also building the capacity to make billions of doses a year, and it has been tested and found safe in millions of people. “This safety data, the manufacturing scale, it’s all added value that could have taken years to develop,” says Stuart. So many of the barriers that face other blue-sky technologies were swept away by the urgency of the pandemic.\n\nBecause of this, the number of new projects is exploding. A recent report from Roots Analysis counted more than 195 mRNA vaccines and other therapies in development. If mRNA is truly a new era in vaccinology, we will likely know in the very near future, from the sheer number of drugs going into testing. BioNTech is working on at least eight new vaccines, some “with the same approach as with Covid,” says Şahin. Moderna has dozens in its pipeline. New labs and biotech companies are also lining up to try their hand, attracted by the growing community and the promise of rapid results.\n\nZiphius Vaccines, a small Belgian company founded in 2019 to focus on mRNA treatments for cancer, pivoted towards infectious disease during the pandemic. “Nobody believed you could produce a vaccine so quickly; but suddenly, with the [mRNA] platform, you can get a target within six weeks,” says Mathieu Ghadanfar, the company’s chief medical officer. Ziphius quickly chose ten targets, including dengue, hepatitis, and tick-borne encephalitis, and is in the preclinical testing stage with its dengue and chlamydia vaccines. Because of the advances of the past year, larger companies have the know-how to rapidly scale up promising results coming from a smaller laboratory. “There are all these facilities that can now produce any mRNA vaccine, and those are here to stay,” says Ghadanfar. “Every day I see a new company getting into mRNA.”\n\nEven the already-streamlined manufacturing process for these vaccines may be about to shrink even further—allowing them to be made not just easier, but virtually anywhere. Because its chemical makeup is relatively simple compared to the whole viruses or living cells we extract for traditional vaccines, mRNA factories need just a fraction of the space. From the size of a “football pitch to a front lawn,” one engineer quipped to me. But there’s no reason they couldn’t get even smaller and simpler. “Like fitting on a desktop, the size of a photocopier. You have your chemicals in a cartridge, and there you go,” says Harris Makatsoris, a professor of sustainable manufacturing systems at King’s College London.\n\nMakatsoris is working on a prototype to do just that. It’s part of a UK government-funded project called the Future Vaccine Manufacturing Research Hub, which was set up to find ways for nations in the global south to make their own vaccines. Makatsoris imagines these personal-scale machines used for small-scale operations in hospitals, but in the event of a pandemic, becoming a sort of national vaccine grid. “With something like 60 machines, you could do the entire population of England,” he says.\n\nOr, pop them in a box and send them wherever they’re needed. “Technically it is quite challenging —but it’s small, it doesn’t involve any hazardous material. It is very transferrable,” says Cleo Kontoravdi, a professor of biosystems engineering at Imperial College. Robin Shattock at Imperial College, who heads the hub, envisions it in similar terms to the personal computing revolution. “The lab-in-a-box is the PC, and companies or labs make software—vaccines or other medicines,” he says. As long as you have the hardware, you can run the program anywhere in the world.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting thing about the next few years is that, as Blakney puts it, there are “so many things we don’t yet know” about what exactly this technology can do. The foundational RNA biologist James Eberwine says that as we learn more about how it functions inside our cells, and how to manipulate that, the more powerful it can become. “The future really is RNA,” he says. “I’ve been a proponent of that for all this time.”\n\nIn the immediate future, the basics of RNA delivery could be hugely improved. Right now, mRNA vaccines work like traditional vaccines, shot into a muscle and sucked up by the cells they encounter there. “It’s a very blunt tool,” says Blakney. She focuses on the lipid nano-particle coating, the globule of fat that surrounds the mRNA vaccine payload like a soap bubble. “People are finding ways now to change the composition to make it act differently in the body, to target the spleen or target the lungs. We’re just starting to understand how to control this system,” she says. Karikó envisions adding new instructions that play on the body’s own signals for shuffling and organising its RNA—preventing it from being used in certain cell types, or changing the timing and length of its action. This could make delivery more precise, less toxic, and ultimately more effective.\n\n“There are real blue-sky possibilities,” says Stuart. mRNA creating proteins is the basic template. She suggests the technology could also be used for protein replacement (treating diseases such as cystic fibrosis, where the body makes a vital protein incorrectly) and monoclonal antibodies (small immune cells that can target diseased and cancerous cells for destruction). At BioNTech, Şahin has been working on both of these since well before Covid, and he’s also excited about what he calls “immune engineering,” using mRNA to deliver instructions for improved versions of the body’s own immune molecules, topping up its existing defenses to last longer, or recognize invaders better.\n\nAll of this is music to Karikó’s ears. The last time I speak to her she is excited about a laboratory that is using mRNA to try and extend human telomeres—long DNA caps at the end of our chromosomes that many believe determine the rate of human aging. She had a similar idea 15 years ago but wasn’t able to pursue it. Now, so much of what she had dreamed of is happening, carried forward by scientists across the world. “When I started this work decades ago, I kept a list of 30 diseases I thought RNA would be good for,” she says. Telomeres were there, cystic fibrosis, emphysema—all have research programs dedicated to them now. And there’s still much more to do. “There are 25 left,” she wrote to me, when I asked about progress so far. “So many things are still out there.”\n\nThis article first appeared in the July/August 2021 issue of WIRED UK.

The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Hanke\n\nhttps://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Perspectives-_1_Did-lockdowns-work__June_web.pdf\n\nAbstract\n\nThe purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the effect of lockdowns, also referred to as ‘Covid restrictions’, ‘social distancing measures’ etc., on COVID-19 mortality based on available empirical evidence. We define lockdowns as the imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). We employ a systematic search and screening procedure in which 19,646 studies are identified that could potentially address the purpose of our study. After three levels of screening, 32 studies qualified. Of those, estimates from 22 studies could be converted to standardised measures for inclusion in the metaanalysis.\n\nThey are separated into three groups: lockdown stringency index studies, shelter-in-place-order (SIPO) studies, and specific NPI studies. Stringency index studies find that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 3.2 per cent. This translates into approximately 6,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 4,000 in the United States. SIPOs were also relatively ineffective in the spring of 2020, only reducing COVID-19 mortality by 2.0 per cent. This translates into approximately 4,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 3,000 in the United States. Based on specific NPIs, we estimate that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 reduced COVID-19 mortality by 10.7 per cent. This translates into approximately 23,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 16,000 in the United States. In comparison, there are approximately 72,000 flu deaths in Europe and 38,000 flu deaths in the United States each year. When checked for potential biases, our results are robust. Our results are also supported by the natural experiments we have been able to identify. The results of our meta-analysis support the conclusion that lockdowns in the spring of 2020 had a negligible effect on COVID-19 mortality. This result is consistent with the view that voluntary changes in behaviour, such as social distancing, did play an important role in mitigating the pandemic.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Herby-Jonung-Hanke meta-analysis found that lockdowns, as reported in studies based on stringency indices in the spring of 2020, reduced mortality by 3.2 per cent when compared to less strict lockdown policies adopted by the likes of Sweden\n\nThis means lockdowns prevented 1,700 deaths in England and Wales, 6,000 deaths across Europe, and 4,000 deaths in the United States.\n\nLockdowns prevented relatively few deaths compared to a typical flu season – in England and Wales, 18,500–24,800 flu deaths occur, in Europe 72,000 flu deaths occur, and in the United States 38,000 flu deaths occur in a typical flu season\n\nThese results pale in comparison to the Imperial College of London’s modelling exercises (March 2020), which predicted that lockdowns would save over 400,000 lives in the United Kingdom and over 2 million lives in the United States\n\nHerby, Jonung, and Hanke conclude that voluntary changes in behaviour, such as social distancing, played a significant role in mitigating the pandemic – but harsher restrictions, like stay-at-home rules and school closures, generated very high costs but produced only negligible health benefits\n\nCOVID-19 lockdowns were “a global policy failure of gigantic proportions,” according to this peer-reviewed new academic study. The draconian policy failed to significantly reduce deaths while imposing substantial social, cultural, and economic costs.\n\nThe comprehensive 220-page book, began with a systematic review of 19,646 potentially relevant studies. For their meta-analysis, the authors’ screening resulted in the choice of 22 studies that are based on actual, measured mortality data, not on results derived from modelling exercises. A meta-analysis is considered the ‘gold-standard’ for evidence, as it combines comparable, independent studies to determine overall trends.\n\nThe authors, including Professor Steve H. Hanke of the Johns Hopkins University, also consider a range of studies that determined the impact of individual lockdown restrictions, including stay at-home rules to school closures and travel restrictions.\n\nIn each case, the restrictions did little to reduce COVID-19 mortality:\n\nShelter-in-place (stay at home) orders in Europe and the United States reduced COVID mortality by between 1.4 and 4.1 per cent;\n\nBusiness closures reduced mortality by 7.5 per cent;\n\nGathering limits likely increased COVID mortality by almost six per cent;\n\nMask mandates, which most countries avoided in Spring 2020, reduced mortality by 18.7 per cent, particularly mandates in workplaces; and\n\nSchool closures resulted in a between 2.5 per cent and 6.2 per cent mortality reduction.\n\nA second approach employed by the authors to estimate the effects of lockdowns on mortality combined studies that looked at specific lockdown measures (such as school closures, mask wearing, etc.) on how single non-pharmaceutical interventions were actually used in Europe and the United States. Using this approach, the authors estimate that lockdowns reduced mortality by 10.7 per cent in the spring of 2020 – significantly less than estimates produced by epidemiological modelling.\n\nThe study compares the effect of lockdown measures against the effect of ‘doing the least,’ rather than doing nothing at all. Sweden’s response to COVID was among the least stringent in Europe, but still imposed some legal restrictions and included an extensive public information campaign.\n\nYou can read the press release for the book here.\n\nFullscreen Mode'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2878711/new-study-confirms-covid-19-lockdowns-did-more-harm-than-good/', 'Headline': 'New study confirms COVID-19 lockdowns did more harm than good', 'Snippet': 'A new Johns Hopkins University study published this week found that COVID-19 lockdowns toward the beginning of the pandemic had “little to no effect” on the COVID-19 mortality rate and ...', 'Full_text': 'The researchers, led by the head of Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, conducted a meta-analysis of 34 studies from the first wave of the pandemic and found that U.S. and European lockdowns, which were held up as an effective tool at limiting deaths, “reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.2% on average.”\n\nIf anything, the shelter-in-place orders and forced limiting of gatherings outdoors might have actually “increased” the death rate by requiring people to stay at home with vulnerable family members, the authors argued.\n\n“We find no evidence that lockdowns, school closures, border closures, and limiting gatherings have had a noticeable effect on COVID-19 mortality,” they wrote.\n\nThe decision to shut down “non-essential” businesses, such as bars, was the only lockdown policy the researchers found to be somewhat effective. But even that policy did more harm than good, they argued, citing several of the lockdowns’ “devastating effects.”\n\n“They have contributed to reducing economic activity, raising unemployment, reducing schooling, causing political unrest, contributing to domestic violence, and undermining liberal democracy,” the report read.\n\nIn other words, the lockdowns were a failure that might have cost more lives than they saved. For example, from May 2020 to April 2021, drug overdose deaths increased by 28.5% from the year before. Domestic violence incidents increased 8.1%. Depression rates tripled in adults in all demographic groups, and suicide attempts among young children and teenagers skyrocketed.\n\nOur response to the pandemic has had severe consequences, and it is well past time for the public health officials who engineered it to admit as much.

We’ve seen video montages, political ads, and politicians’ social media posts that harken to statements they say he’s made and describe those statements as lies.\n\nAt the heart of these claims is widespread misunderstanding about how the scientific method works.\n\nIt is a perspective informed in part by frustration. Changing guidelines impact people’s daily lives. But the claims ignore the realities and challenges presented by a global pandemic caused by an emerging virus, researchers and science experts told us.\n\nScientists and doctors are worn down by the narrative.\n\n""These kinds of charges are frustrating,"" said Sarah Richardson, a science historian at Harvard University. ""They reflect a misunderstanding of how science works, how public health policy is created, and how empirical science and public health policy relate to one another.""\n\nScientific findings are often confusing and conflicting. But evolving research and changing guidelines aren’t unprecedented or shocking, nor are they indicative of something nefarious.\n\n""I can hardly blame people for feeling confused, but the problem is how this has been used politically,"" said Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. ""I think there has been a deliberate effort to take advantage of that kind of confusion by accusing people of purposely misleading the public and there is no way that that has been happening — it’s not reality.""\n\nHow COVID-19 impacted science\n\nMarilyn Mar, right, and Nai-Hua Jeng analyze samples from suspected COVID-19 patients at the Stanford Clinical Virology Laboratory on Feb. 3, 2021, in Palo Alto, Calif. Scientists analyze samples for genetic changes, watching for mutations. (AP)\n\nScience is hard. COVID-19 made it harder. One reason is simply the unusually lengthy timeline of this pandemic.\n\nMost traditional epidemics run though communities over intervals of several months, said Dr. David Jones, an epidemiology professor at Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health and professor of the culture of medicine at the university’s history of science department.\n\n""Too short of a time for researchers to launch and analyze studies that could have changed their thinking,"" he said.\n\nThe scientific process takes time. It involves a series of observations and hypotheses that are followed up with tests and experiments that are tweaked and fine-tuned along the way. Heading into three years of COVID-19, it’s to be expected that scientific consensus — when it can be achieved — would change. When you add in a rapidly-evolving virus like SARS-CoV-2 which has impacted vaccine efficacy and the need for boosters, things get more complicated.\n\n""Someone has an observation, they do a study to test it, they learn something about it. And, as we learn more over time, we find out nuances,"" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director at the American Public Health Association. ""With COVID-19, we didn\'t have a static physical or biological object. It has been changing rapidly and we are altering the research along with it. The facts of the science haven\'t changed, the experiments and the virus have.""\n\nAs scientists did their work, thousands were dying every day. Public health officials still had to give guidance with the goal of trying to keep as many people as safe as possible.\n\nThere were so many mysteries to solve when SARS-CoV-2 first emerged. No. 1: How was it transmitted? At first, many scientists believed, wrongly in hindsight, that it would behave similarly to SARS, a coronavirus that caused an outbreak in 2003. That virus, formally called SARS-CoV-1, caused an outbreak that lasted a short period. This is due, in part, to the fact that asymptomatic people could not spread it.\n\nWith its asymptomatic spread, COVID-19 turned out to be to SARS what a fox is to a dog, Goldman said: ""They\'re both canines, but they’re very different animals.""\n\nThere was no handbook for this new virus.\n\n""Even just logically giving advice on how other members of the very same family of coronaviruses — a lot of that didn’t work,"" Goldman said. ""Controlling those viruses is completely different from controlling COVID. But I think people tried very hard to do everything they could to save lives.""\n\nAmong pandemics in history, COVID-19 stands alone. But experts said the 1918 influenza pandemic provides a good example of how scientific understanding develops in such a crisis.\n\nThe 1918 pandemic had three main waves spanning one to two years. Scientists kept trying to identify its cause. At the time, they believed that a number of bacteria were responsible for the outbreak, only to discover years later in the 1930s that the cause was a virus.\n\nBut the scientists who had incorrectly proposed a bacterial origin weren’t ""lying,"" experts said. They were doing hard science in a crisis setting with inadequate tools, which can lead to wrong answers.\n\nIt’s also important to acknowledge the role that interest groups play in challenging what are sometimes unpopular scientific findings. There is a long history, going back to tobacco in the 1950s or climate change in the 1980s, where interest groups highlighted the imperfections of the scientific process in order to advance their own interests.\n\nScience is easy to critique as studies vary in terms of scale and robustness, Jones said. If science is used to regulate interests that profit from lack of regulation, it makes sense that those groups would characterize the scientists as liars.\n\n""Messaging from the CDC and NIH has left a lot to be desired, and political interests shape it, but that doesn’t mean that Fauci was ‘lying,’"" Jones said.\n\nConfusion over masks\n\nKindergarten teacher Karen Drolet, left, works with a student at Raices Dual Language Academy, a public school in Central Falls, R.I., Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2022. (AP)\n\nMask-wearing quickly became one of the most volatile aspects of the pandemic. Answers to questions about which masks to wear, where to wear them and who should wear them have fluctuated with time and understanding.\n\nBefore COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, Fauci advised the general public against wearing masks. This was due to initial confusion about how COVID-19 was transmitted and concerns about mask shortages for essential workers. When it became clear that there wouldn’t be a shortage and that public mask-wearing, along with social distancing, could greatly reduce transmission, recommendations changed.\n\nScientists still believe that masks are effective at preventing illness — that hasn’t changed. But public health guidance around masks has. That’s because scientific understanding has changed about what types of masks are most effective in the face of different COVID-19 variants and in different settings. Once used widely outside, masks are now known to be most useful indoors and in crowded spaces, where risk of transmission is far higher.\n\n""The first message of no masks was absolutely wrong, because (not wearing a) mask completely exposes you. Cloth masks that are multi-layered offer better protection, but the best is a well-fitting N95 mask,"" Benjamin said. ""But it’s a spectrum of protections, and we really need to talk about this in terms of risk and degrees of protection.""\n\nAlso at play in masking recommendations: rises and falls in infection rates and an upward trend in vaccination rates. With the CDC poised in late February to again revise its masking guidelines amid dropping COVID-19 infections, Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said it makes sense to think about masks as we think about raincoats.\n\n""You wear it when it\'s raining,"" he said in a Feb. 23 interview with NPR. ""You take it off when it stops raining. And if we think of masks in that way, then yeah, during surges, we should have masks, and everybody should be wearing them. And when the surge ends, we should take off our masks.""\n\nMasks have also been hard to study, experts said\n\nMasking can be ""highly context-specific,"" Harvard’s Richardson said: ""Are other people masking? Are they vaccinated and boosted? What kinds of masks? What is the level of transmission in the community? Are they mandated? Are other mitigation policies in place?""\n\nThe question gets more complicated when it’s about masking in schools.\n\n""Do mask mandates in elementary schools help? I suspect you could find scientific articles that have drawn different conclusions from their data,"" Jones said. ""This is in part because good science is hard to do — some studies might be methodologically better than others and therefore closer to the ‘right answer’ — in part because contexts matter. Was the study done in warm or cold weather? Were the students indoors for eight hours at a stretch, or for less time? etc. Will a clear answer ever emerge? I’m really not sure.""\n\nThese uncertainties are essential to the scientific process, but are like firewood for skeptics.\n\nThen there’s political pressure. As public sentiment about the pandemic shifts, we’ve seen a number of Democratic lawmakers take action to lift mask mandates and ease other restrictions.\n\nWhile politics most certainly plays a role in some of these decisions, criticism of those actions fails to recognize that the landscape looks different now than it did when these rules were put in place. Among the many new factors are vaccines, case declines, optimism over news of milder variants, and mounting public concern about mental health struggles.\n\n""Creating public health policy requires uniting a wide range of constituencies around a shared platform, weighing costs and benefits,"" Richardson said. ""This is a slow-moving process, embedded in our democratic systems of governance, with its own constraints and inertias.""\n\nPublic messaging errors\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021. (AP)\n\nPublic health officials have attempted to alter their messaging in response to the science, but the end result hasn’t always been very effective or clear.\n\n""If we could go back, I think people would have given a lot more caution in their responses,"" Benjamin said. ""I think we would\'ve seen officials say, ‘This is what we know today, but it may be different later.’ There would be a lot more humility and detailed explanations about why things change.""\n\nIt’s all had an impact on how Americans view science. A Pew Research Center survey published Feb. 15 found 29% of U.S. adults said they have a great deal of confidence in medical scientists to act in the best interests of the public, down from 40% in November 2020.\n\nAnd a 2021 study by sociologists at the University of New Hampshire found that 31% of Americans surveyed said they believe scientists ""adjust their findings to get the answer they want."" Another 16% weren’t sure.\n\nWhat seems to be behind that belief, according to the sociologists? A ""misunderstanding of scientific methods, uncertainty, and the incremental nature of scientific inquiry.""'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/10/opinions/covid-19-pandemic-lockdowns-sepkowitz/index.html', 'Headline': 'Opinion: No, Covid-19 lockdowns were not a mistake | CNN', 'Snippet': 'Responding to an excerpt from the book “The Big Fail,” which points to what the authors deem public health missteps during the Covid-19 pandemic — most notably lockdowns — Kent Sepkowitz ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: Kent Sepkowitz is a physician and infectious disease expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nAs the clear and present danger of the Covid-19 pandemic begins to fade, discussions and judgments have been swirling as to whether the various battlefield public health decisions to confront the crisis were effective.\n\nEarlier this year, an analysis of the efficacy of wearing a mask caused such an uproar that the estimable Cochrane Review issued a very unusual statement to clarify just what the article said (the study limitations were too great to conclude much) and didn’t say (masks don’t work, full stop).\n\nMore recently, a British government inquiry into the country’s day-to-day pandemic management has suggested that decisions (“over-confidence and lack of planning”) and attitude (“misogyny and lack of humanity in the government’s response”) were sorely lacking.\n\nAnd now, business reporters Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera have published a book, “The Big Fail,” excerpted in a New York Magazine article headlined: “Covid Lockdowns were a Giant Experiment. It was a Failure.” (Full disclosure: I have read only the magazine excerpt, not the full book.) Given this provocative title, it is unsurprising to find a withering assessment of the lockdowns used in the US and many other countries as a means to control Covid-19.\n\nThe authors make some good points: The lockdown dislocated students from schools and customers from places of business. Medical care was delayed for some (though needed surgeries continued when hospital beds were available). And, most dramatically, young students lost the educational and social advantage of a physical classroom. (As for the students, by some accounts, the academic impact seems to have been transient.)\n\nThey summarize the issue this way: “Did the many social, economic, and medical downsides make [lockdowns], in the aggregate, not worth whatever short-term benefits they might yield?” Their answer is a loud “no.”\n\nTo which I, having read the same dozens of primary articles they did, say: You bet it was worth it.\n\nYes, lockdown was a blunt instrument that caused a great deal of collateral damage. The difference between my view and theirs, I think, is that they consider the lockdown a single activity stretched across the entire pandemic; in contrast, I would distinguish the initial lockdown, which was crucial, from the off-and-on lockdowns as therapies, vaccines and overall care improved. There is an argument to be made that these were not anywhere near as effective.\n\nIn other words, I consider the “short-term benefits” to be absolutely critical in allowing the medical world to steady itself and gain a much firmer grasp of the task at hand. One only had to work in health care in New York City to see the difference between early 2020, when the explosion of cases overwhelmed the city, versus later in 2020 when an effective therapy had been identified, supplies and diagnostic testing had been greatly improved (though still completely inadequate) and the makeshift ICUs and emergency rooms had been set in place.\n\nIt was still a nightmare to be sure, but it was a vastly more organized nightmare.\n\nThe “short-term benefits” at the start of the pandemic are simple to characterize: Every infection that was delayed due to the lockdowns was a day to the good, a day closer to the release of the mRNA vaccines in December 2020, a less-hectic day for the health care workers, a day for clinical trials to mature. Therefore, the authors’ statement that lockdowns “were a mistake that should not be repeated” because they had no “purpose other than keeping hospitals from being overrun in the short-term” is to me a fundamental misunderstanding of the day-to-day work that was being done.\n\nMost disturbing to me about this assessment and the others that have come along are the minimal mention of the death and debility the infection caused. A reminder for those who have forgotten just how brutal the pandemic was: Worldwide there have been 7 million deaths. In the US, there have been more than a million deaths, millions have some post-infection debility and many health care workers remain profoundly demoralized.\n\nIn this context, many of the outcomes of concern listed by Nocera and McLean — suicidal thoughts in teens, alcoholism and drug use increases, violence — are as easily explained by this staggering death toll as by the cabin fever brought on by lockdowns. Once again: About 1 out of every 350 Americans died in the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnother way to consider the impact of so many deaths is examination of life expectancy. Of note, life expectancy in the US fell in 2020 (1.8 years) and 2021 (0.6 years), the sharpest drop since the 1920s; per the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 74% of the drop was attributed to Covid-19. This perspective makes a simple point for those who consider many deaths among the elderly and very elderly as sad but without larger societal implications. From the society perspective, if only the old and very old die, there should be little if any impact on life expectancy. To fall more than two years so precipitously requires the deaths of many in their 30s and 40s and 50s, as occurred with the first year of the pandemic.\n\nDespite endless studies, the debate about lockdowns will continue. The data is not clean. Real data — not prissy data from a generic randomized placebo controlled double-blind trial run by a pharma company with deep pockets (albeit with a desired outcome as well) — is never clean. Therefore, in its uncertainty there is room for all sorts of interpretations, crazy and not, and the issue will not be settled, though I agree that we must try.\n\nI do think that a practical conclusion that we may send to those caught up in a future pandemic of respiratory virus is this: Lock down hard and quickly until you and the world can get your bearings. Maintaining a functional health care system is crucial.\n\nThis of course shifts the hard debate to follow-up decisions. Once started, how quickly can one lift a lockdown? For me, this is the very unclear and very difficult problem and one that can frustrate an already overwhelmed public. The back and forth of the lockdown edicts seemed like more governmental dithering to many and requires a great deal of focused consideration.\n\nBut one large caveat to making the decisions that lie ahead: Historians — the tweedy tenured types — understand they stand at a safe remove from the events they are recounting. They acknowledge that being in the middle of total chaos is very different than writing about those who were in the middle of total chaos. The eminent historian Bernard Bailyn warned against the distortion this can impose: “The fact — the inescapable fact — is that we [historians] know how it all came out…and they [those involved in the events] did not.”\n\nTrue, those of us now giving our own analyses on the effectiveness of lockdowns lived through the pandemic. But still, we should consider context of the Covid reality that we are now somewhat removed from in our assessments. We now know that Covid-19 faded slowly in 2023; the public health experts in the center of the crisis did not. They followed what little science was available and made their best judgments. So let’s perhaps follow the decent path and evaluate but not castigate as we together try to understand just what happened.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-rfk-jr-s-covid-19-deceptions/', 'Headline': 'RFK Jr.’s COVID-19 Deceptions - FactCheck.org', 'Snippet': 'One of Kennedy’s most notable recent comments is the false claim that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may have been “targeted” to attack Caucasians and Black people — and that ...', 'Full_text': 'Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s battle against vaccines — and against the institutions that promote them — goes back to at least the mid-2000s, as we explain in the first article of this series. But the arrival of COVID-19 gave the environmental attorney fresh grounds to intensify his attacks and a timely platform to gain new followers and revenue.\n\nKennedy’s organization, Children’s Health Defense, has published thousands of stories about COVID-19, many including misleading claims, some of which we’ve written about. During the pandemic, CHD increased its reach and doubled its funds, according to an investigation by the Associated Press. The extra money allowed the group to open new branches in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia; translate stories into Spanish, French, Italian and German; launch an internet TV channel; and start a movie studio. (Kennedy took a leave of absence starting on April 1 for his presidential campaign.)\n\nIn 2021, researchers identified Kennedy as one of the “Disinformation Dozen,” or the top 12 most prolific spreaders of COVID-19 misinformation online. That same year, Instagram took down Kennedy’s account for spreading false information, although it was reinstated in June because of his campaign. In 2022, Meta removed CHD’s Facebook and Instagram accounts for “repeatedly” violating its COVID-19 misinformation policies (the local chapters are still active on the platforms).\n\nCOVID-19 has given Kennedy a new base that shares a mistrust in health and governmental institutions, and he has consistently associated himself with the anti-vaccine movement. In Kennedy’s 2021 book, “The Real Anthony Fauci,” he presents the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as the villain, carrying out a Machiavellian plan in partnership with pharmaceutical companies to profit from vaccines, while describing a list of prominent anti-vaccine figures to whom the book is dedicated as “heroic.”\n\nIn December 2021, Kennedy falsely called the COVID-19 vaccine “the deadliest vaccine ever made,” citing deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which is part of the nation’s vaccine safety monitoring systems. But as we have explained, the reports are unverified and, as the VAERS website warns, any report “to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event.” Expanded reporting requirements and intense scrutiny of the widely given COVID-19 vaccines did increase reporting to VAERS, but this doesn’t mean the shots are unsafe.\n\nThis is one installment in a three-part series correcting RFK Jr.’s false and misleading health and science claims.\n\nMore recently, during his campaign, Kennedy hosted a virtual roundtable with some top COVID-19 misinformation spreaders, including Dr. Joseph Mercola, Del Bigtree and Dr. Pierre Kory. And in the first episode of his campaign YouTube series “Running on Truth,” the only three people featured are Dr. Christiane Northrup, Dr. Robert Malone and Kory — each of whom have pushed COVID-19 disinformation.\n\nTime and again, Kennedy has misrepresented or distorted the science about the pandemic or the COVID-19 vaccines. Here, in the final installment of this three-part series, we review some of his claims on those topics that he’s made so far during his campaign challenging President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWe reached out to his campaign for this series, but we haven’t received a response.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 23: Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign on Aug. 23 and encouraged his supporters in key swing states to vote for former President Donald Trump.\n\nDeep Misrepresentation of Early Pandemic Genomic Study\n\nOne of Kennedy’s most notable recent comments is the false claim that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may have been “targeted” to attack Caucasians and Black people — and that Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people are the “most immune” to the disease.\n\n“In fact, COVID-19 — there is an argument that it is ethnically targeted. COVID-19 attacks certain races disproportionately,” Kennedy said while talking about bioweapons and “ethnically targeted microbes,” during a press dinner in New York, made public by the New York Post. “COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.”\n\nIt is not known, he added, “whether it was deliberately targeted or not, but there are papers out there that show the … racial and ethnic differential and impact to that.” As we will explain, studies do not support his claims.\n\nHis comments, published the morning of July 15, were widely and strongly criticized and condemned.\n\nHours after publication, Kennedy took to Twitter, which is now known as X, to defend himself. He said the New York Post story was “mistaken,” since he had “never, ever suggested” that SARS-CoV-2 “was targeted to spare Jews,” referring to the Post’s headline.\n\nBut then he added that he had “accurately pointed out … that the U.S. and other governments are developing ethnically targeted bioweapons and that a 2021 study of the COVID-19 virus shows that COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect certain races since the furin cleave docking site is most compatible with Blacks and Caucasians and least compatible with ethnic Chinese, Finns, and Ashkenazi Jews. In that sense, it serves as a kind of proof of concept for ethnically targeted bioweapons. I do not believe and never implied that the ethnic effect was deliberately engineered.” His post included a link to a study published in July 2020, not 2021.\n\nAs we’ve written, all U.S. intelligence agencies agree that COVID-19 is not the result of a biological weapon.\n\nIn addition, the study’s findings “never supported” Kennedy’s claim, one of the authors told CBS News.\n\nThe study was done early in the pandemic, before any treatment was available, and the authors wanted to find out if genetic factors contributed to COVID-19 susceptibility, since that information could help in the development of personalized treatments.\n\nBut the study didn’t test whether certain gene variants actually make people more susceptible to the coronavirus — and it did not find that “COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect certain races” because of genetic factors, as Kennedy claimed.\n\nInstead, the authors probed around 81,000 human genomes for mutations in two proteins that allow the coronavirus to enter cells, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. They then used computer programs to identify 124 mutations that might make COVID-19 worse, and looked to see how common those mutations were in different populations.\n\nThe team found that certain groups, specifically African or African American and Non-Finnish Europeans, were more likely to have these possibly harmful variants than others — and that for ACE2, no mutations were identified in genomes from Ashkenazi Jewish or Amish populations (East Asian, along with Finnish, South Asian and Latino populations, were in between).\n\nBut as the authors acknowledged, the results only “suggested possible associations” between certain gene variants and COVID-19 susceptibility — and needed to be validated in COVID-19 patients.\n\nOne genomics expert noted on X that it’s possible the paper’s findings simply reflect the bias in the genome sampling, since very few genomes were from Ashkenazi Jewish or Amish people, while far more were from African or African American or European people.\n\nMoreover, most of the possibly harmful mutations are rare in the populations — often 0.01% or less — so they hardly represent a good way of creating an ethnically-targeted bioweapon, even if the findings were to be validated.\n\n“Even if there are links to certain genetic makeups that MAY put you at higher or lower risk,” Florian Krammer, a virologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told PolitiFact, “these influences have a low effect size.”\n\nAnother study, published in April 2021, which did perform some biochemical assays to try to confirm some results, found ACE2 variants that increase or decrease COVID-19 susceptibility “to be rare, which is consistent with the overall low number of ACE2 receptor population level polymorphisms.” The researchers also said they didn’t find any statistically significant difference in the frequency of ACE2 variants in different population groups.\n\nStudies have found that racial disparities in COVID-19 cases and deaths are explained mostly by structural social and economic inequities, such as access to quality healthcare, not by genetic differences. Research has not suggested that Jewish or Chinese people have any kind of genetic “immunity” to COVID-19.\n\nThis is not the first time Kennedy has made controversial comments about Jewish people during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a rally against vaccine mandates in 2022, he said Jewish people were in a better situation in Nazi Germany than people in the U.S. under public health policies adopted to slow the spread of COVID-19. “Even in Hitler’s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland. You could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did,” he said.\n\nDuring a hearing convened by House Republicans in July, Kennedy denied accusations of racism and antisemitism, and in an exchange with Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida, falsely claimed he had “never ever” compared public health measures during the pandemic with Hitler’s Germany.\n\nKennedy’s Misunderstanding of COVID-19 Vaccines and Transmission\n\nDuring an interview with the New Yorker, published July 7, Kennedy said he knew early on that COVID-19 vaccines “should be dead in the water” because they “won’t prevent transmission.”\n\n“[T]he scientists all, at one point, believed that the COVID vaccine prevented transmission,” he said. “I said, No, they don’t prevent transmission, because I read the monkey studies in May of 2020, and I saw that the amount of the concentration of the virus in the nasal pharynx of the vaccinated monkey was identical to the unvaccinated monkeys.”\n\nFirst, as we’ve explained before, stopping disease transmission is not a requirement for a vaccine. While some vaccines do reduce the spread of disease, others do not — and an inability to do so doesn’t mean a vaccine has failed. Often, the main goal of a vaccine is to prevent disease or severe disease, which is the case for the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines were authorized for emergency use based on their ability to prevent symptomatic disease in clinical trials, not for any effect on transmission. In December 2020, when the Food and Drug Administration authorized the first COVID-19 vaccine, the agency even warned that it wasn’t known whether the vaccine would prevent spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThat didn’t mean the COVID-19 vaccines would do nothing for transmission, though. In the following months, data showed that vaccination did reduce spread, either because vaccinated people were protected against infection in the first place or because they were less contagious if infected.\n\nWith the emergence of the omicron variant, however, which is more transmissible and immune evasive, the vaccines were no longer as good at preventing infection or reducing onward spread of the virus. The vaccines likely do still reduce transmission, but only a little bit, and for a shorter period of time, research has shown. That doesn’t mean the shots don’t work. The vaccines still provide some protection against symptomatic disease and reduce the risk of severe disease and death.\n\nKennedy is also wrong to claim that studies of the then-candidate vaccines in monkeys showed no difference in viral concentration in the nasopharynx and indicated the vaccines would have no effect on transmission. In a study published in July 2020, animals vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine and then purposely infected with the virus showed much lower levels of virus in samples from the nose and lung than purposely infected unvaccinated animals.\n\nThe authors even wrote that their study “showed early prevention of viral replication in the upper and lower airways after a high-dose challenge,” noting that “the ability to limit viral replication in both the lower and the upper airways has important implications for vaccine-induced prevention of both SARS-CoV-2 disease and transmission.”\n\nThe results were similar for Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose adenoviral COVID-19 vaccine. In a study published in Nature in July 2020, only one of the six vaccinated monkeys had any detectable virus in its nose at any time point — in sharp contrast to the unvaccinated animals, which had much more virus for a longer time.\n\nThe monkey results were more ambiguous for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. One vaccine design, BNT162b1, showed a more clear reduction in the viral load in nasal samples, while another, BNT162b2 — the one that was ultimately used in the vaccine — did not. But it’s not true that the amount of virus in the unvaccinated and vaccinated animals was “identical.” One day after infection, the BNT162b2-vaccinated animals had higher amounts of virus in their noses than unvaccinated controls, but for all other tested subsequent days, starting on day 3, none of the BNT162b2-vaccinated animals had any detectable virus at all in their noses, unlike the unvaccinated animals. Swabs taken from the back of the throat also showed both vaccine designs reduced the amount of virus there.\n\nIt’s possible Kennedy is thinking of the monkey test results for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Those results, released in May 2020, did not show any difference in the viral load in the nose among vaccinated and unvaccinated animals — something that the Moderna authors commented on and contrasted with their results. But the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a different design than the mRNA shots and was never used in the U.S. And despite the monkey results, subsequent research suggests the AstraZeneca vaccine did reduce transmission in people.\n\nWhat the Cleveland Clinic Study Shows About Vaccine Effectiveness\n\nIn recent interviews, Kennedy also has cited a study by the Cleveland Clinic to bolster a false claim that the COVID-19 vaccines provide “no advantage.”\n\nIn a June 15 episode of the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast, he said, “What that study shows, the more vaccines you get, the more likely it is that you’re going to get sick and that the people who are most vaccinated have … 3.5 times the risk of illness that people who are unvaccinated. So, I mean, that’s not a good profile for, you know, a medical product.”\n\nKennedy relayed the same Cleveland Clinic study results in a June 25 episode of the podcast “Club Random with Bill Maher.” After Maher followed up with a question about the protection vaccines provide against severe COVID-19, Kennedy said, “My belief about that is there is no advantage to the vaccine.”\n\nAs we’ve said, there is clear evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines have prevented severe disease and death, and provided some protection against infection and more mild disease.\n\nAs with many of Kennedy’s statements, there is a grain of truth that has been misinterpreted.\n\nAs we explained in a prior article, observational studies like the Cleveland Clinic one can appear to show relationships between things that are not in fact directly related. The study of Cleveland Clinic workers showed that in the months after the bivalent omicron booster became available, employees who had received more doses of the original COVID-19 vaccines and boosters were statistically more likely to test positive for COVID-19. In one analysis, people who got more than three prior vaccine doses were around 3.5 times more likely to have a COVID-19 diagnosis than those who had no prior doses.\n\nBut the finding doesn’t show that the COVID-19 vaccines caused greater COVID-19 risk, experts told us, or that “the more vaccines you get, the more likely it is that you’re going to get sick,” as Kennedy claimed.\n\nStudy co-author Dr. Nabin Shrestha, an infectious disease physician at the Cleveland Clinic, told us that “a study like this, one study, is not going to prove any cause-effect relationship.”\n\nExperts told us about many factors that could make it appear that vaccines increased COVID-19 risk when in fact they did not. For instance, it’s possible that people who got more prior doses were more likely to seek out testing, to be older and less healthy, or to have more exposure to the virus — and less likely to have been recently infected. Any of these factors could increase COVID-19 risk.\n\nFurther, the Cleveland Clinic study’s main finding was that the bivalent omicron booster did provide some initial protection against testing positive for COVID-19, in keeping with results from other studies. Research has generally shown that additional COVID-19 shots broaden the immune response to the virus.\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Trial Result Claims\n\nKennedy also provides a misleading description of the trial results for the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine by focusing on the COVID-19 deaths in the vaccine and placebo groups — and doing some bad math.\n\n“[D]uring that six-month period in the vaccine group, one person died of COVID, and in the placebo group, two people died from COVID. So that allows Pfizer to tell the public — and, you know, FDA to tell the public — Oh, this vaccine is 100% effective because two is 100% of one,” he told Rogan during his interview.\n\nFirst, neither Pfizer/BioNTech nor the FDA ever said the vaccine had an efficacy of 100% based on deaths from COVID-19, which wasn’t even an endpoint in the trial. And of course, that’s not how the math works anyway — there would have to be zero deaths in the vaccine group to get an efficacy of 100%.\n\nThe main way the COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated for efficacy was their ability to prevent symptomatic COVID-19, which was the basis of the emergency use authorizations. Pfizer/BioNTech first reported the vaccine had 95% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in November 2020, and the same number was used by the FDA for the authorization almost a month later. In 2021, the updated trial results showed an efficacy of 91%. Moderna’s final trial data showed an efficacy of 93%.\n\nA secondary efficacy measurement was against severe COVID-19, which included death. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was either 95% or 100% effective, depending on the definition of severe COVID-19, according to the trial data. That figure was calculated comparing the number of severe cases starting seven days after the second dose, which was one in the vaccine group versus 21 in the placebo group (95%), or zero in the vaccine group versus 31 in the placebo group (100%).\n\nThe efficacy of the vaccine was not measured against COVID-19 deaths because they are much less common than the symptomatic disease. Maria Sundaram, a researcher at the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Population Health at Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, told us a much larger trial would have been required for that, which would have taken longer.\n\n“[W]e were also worried about COVID-19 symptomatic illness,” she told us in an email. “For nearly all cases of severe COVID-19, including COVID-19 related deaths, a key component is a symptomatic COVID-19 illness. So an important logical step here is that a population reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 illness would also likely represent a population reduction in more severe COVID-19 outcomes.”\n\nSubsequent observational studies, she noted, have shown the vaccines work to prevent COVID-19-related death.\n\nDuring the same interview, Kennedy noted that 17 people died in the placebo group, while 21 died in the vaccine group. He proceeded to incorrectly claim that those data show that “if you take the vaccine, you’re … 21% more likely to die over six months.”\n\nKennedy is right in that, according to updated trial data available in an FDA document, there were a total of 38 deaths starting from when participants got their first dose of the vaccine or placebo up to March 13, 2021; 21 in the vaccine group and 17 in the placebo group. But these are deaths from all causes. “None of the deaths were considered related to vaccination,” the trial document adds.\n\n“The 17/21 figure does not mean that the vaccine causes harm,” Sundaram told us. “We hope that the randomization procedure has the result of making the treatment groups as similar as possible. Because life is random and there are many factors outside of our control, sometimes there is a small difference in a clinical trial that is due to random chance.”\n\n“There has not been any suggestion of an increased risk of death associated with vaccine in any vaccine safety study of COVID-19 vaccines in the US,” she added.\n\nKennedy’s Attack on Pandemic Policies\n\nDuring his campaign, Kennedy has repeatedly associated pre-vaccine public health measures to control the pandemic, such as business closures and stay-at-home orders, with what he calls an “attack” on the middle class.\n\n“There’s been a systematic attack on our middle class, and the coup de grâce was a lockdown,” he says in an eight-minute campaign video.\n\nThe “lockdowns,“ Kennedy told Michael Smerconish during a town hall in Pennsylvania in June, were a “16 trillion dollar expense for which we got nothing.”\n\n“Lockdowns robbed four trillion [dollars] from the middle class and the poor in this country and transferred it to the super rich. We created five hundred new billionaires—a billionaire a day, every day,” he also told the New Yorker.\n\nAs we’ve written, several studies have found the restrictions imposed by the government in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus did reduce COVID-19 cases and/or deaths. (What many people have called “lockdowns” in the U.S. were not true lockdowns, such as the ones seen in China. Stay-at-home orders, for example, limited daily movement to essential activities and were loosely enforced.)\n\nKennedy did not respond to our requests asking for the source of his figures, but $16 trillion appears in a viewpoint article published by two Harvard economists in JAMA in October 2020. The early estimate, however, isn’t specific to the cost of “lockdowns,” but rather, covers the total cost of the pandemic. It considered all economic losses, including premature deaths and long-term health impairment, and assumed that the pandemic would be “substantially contained by the fall of 2021.”\n\nThe 500 new billionaires number likely comes from Forbes, which in 2021 reported a record 493 people joined its “World’s Billionaires” list during the pandemic, “meaning the world on average gained a new billionaire every 17 hours” since March 18, 2020. But contrary to Kennedy’s suggestion that the billionaires are all in the U.S., the number is for the entire globe. China alone had 205 new billionaires, while the U.S. had 98.\n\nThe $4 trillion figure could come from a 2022 Oxfam analysis, which found that the net worth of billionaires across the globe increased by $3.8 trillion during the pandemic (a newer Oxfam analysis says billionaires increased their wealth by $5 trillion during the pandemic). But again, the figure isn’t specific to the U.S.\n\nOr, Kennedy could be referring to an approximate figure for the federal response to the coronavirus, which totaled $4.6 trillion as of Jan. 31, 2023, according to the Government Accountability Office. While some of the funds were stolen, wasted or misspent, a good portion of the money went to programs to help lower and middle class people, including unemployment insurance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps.\n\nClaims About Unproven COVID-19 Treatments\n\nDespite the fact that several large, randomized controlled trials have found that neither the antiparasitic drug ivermectin nor the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine benefits COVID-19 patients, Kennedy continues to push these unproven drugs as effective treatments against the disease.\n\n“They had to destroy ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and discredit it, and they had to tell everybody it’s not effective because if they had acknowledged that it’s effective … the whole $200 billion vaccine enterprise would have collapsed,” he told Rogan, during his June interview.\n\nIn Kennedy’s logic, “they,” presumably the government and scientists, “had to” lie about the effectiveness of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine because by law, “you cannot issue … an emergency use authorization to a vaccine if there is an existing medication that has been approved for any purpose and that is demonstrated effective against the target illness,” he said.\n\nOne of the legal requirements of an EUA, according to the FDA, is that “there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.” But as Georgia State University College of Law professor Allison M. Whelan told us in an email, “RFK Jr. misunderstands what this provision means in practice and how the FDA interprets that provision.”\n\nFirst, the FDA distinguishes between products that treat a disease and those that prevent a disease, such as a vaccine.\n\n“An EUA for a safe and effective treatment would have no impact on an EUA for a safe and effective vaccine. In broader terms, one EUA does not preclude other EUAs,” California Western School of Law professor Joanna Sax told us in an email.\n\nAnd even if a drug had approval, rather than authorization, to treat COVID-19, that would not prevent the FDA from authorizing or approving a vaccine, and vice-versa. Sax mentioned the antiviral Paxlovid as an example, which got an EUA as a COVID-19 treatment in December 2021, even though Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine was already approved.\n\nKennedy is still wrong even if he is thinking of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as preventives. In that case, Whelan said, “the FDA could have still had the flexibility to issue EUAs and, ultimately, approvals, for both.”\n\nAs an FDA guidance document explains, the existence of an approved product doesn’t preclude an EUA for another product — the approved product must also be “adequate” and “available.” The guidance explains that, for example, a product may be considered “unavailable” if there’s not enough supply of it, or “inadequate” if the approved alternative has contraindications for specific populations.\n\nLegally, then, Kennedy’s argument is bogus. It’s also predicated on the incorrect notion that these drugs work for COVID-19, when they do not.\n\nAs we’ve written, clinical trials of both ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine have shown no evidence of effectiveness against COVID-19.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, which recommends against the use of ivermectin, reviewed at least a dozen randomized controlled trials, including three large ones — the Together trial, the ACTIV-6 trial and COVID-OUT trial — and all of them showed that ivermectin had no significant impact on symptoms, emergency department visits, hospitalization or death associated with COVID-19.\n\nHydroxychloroquine was briefly authorized for emergency use in 2020, but as we reported, the agency revoked the EUA after randomized controlled trials found no benefit to COVID-19 patients and it became clear that the risks of using the drug to prevent the disease were greater than the benefits. The Recovery trial in the U.K. found no significant difference in mortality among hospitalized patients using hydroxychloroquine — 27% of them died within 28 days, compared with 25% of the patients who received standard care.\n\nThe results of these randomized controlled trials — considered the gold standard in evaluating safety and efficacy — have not stopped Kennedy from promoting these drugs as effective.\n\nMoreover, in a July 10 interview with Jesse Watters, Kennedy said Fauci, the former NIAID director, “caused a lot of injury” by not providing ivermectin and other unapproved COVID-19 treatments to people in the U.S.\n\n“[W]e racked up the highest death count in the world. We only have 4.2% of the globe’s population, but we had 16% of the COVID deaths in this country, and that is … that was from bad policy. There’s … countries that did the opposite of what we did — that provided ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, other early treatments to their populations — and had 1/200th of our death rate,” he told Watters.\n\nThe U.S. does have the highest number of total deaths by COVID-19 in the world and the highest rate of deaths among wealthy countries. But there’s no evidence that’s because people weren’t taking unproven treatments such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which, as we’ve said, haven’t been shown to benefit people with COVID-19 in multiple studies.\n\nAccording to a New York Times analysis, the U.S. did worse than other wealthy countries in part because it had a smaller share of people fully vaccinated.\n\nIt is also worth noting that countries that authorized the use of unproven treatments did not do particularly well compared with the rest of the world. In Peru, for example, ivermectin was used extensively. Yet as of this March, when the data was last updated, the country had the highest per capita COVID-19 death rate in the world, according to a tracker from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCOVID-19 Origins\n\nKennedy has promoted false theories about the origins of the 1918 flu pandemic, HIV, RSV and Lyme disease. He also brings up unfounded claims about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and has a forthcoming book on the topic.\n\nTo summarize the state of the evidence: There is no ironclad proof of how SARS-CoV-2 originated. Four U.S. intelligence community agencies, the National Intelligence Council and many scientists say the virus most likely jumped from animals to humans in a natural spillover. There is a strong case this happened at the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market in Wuhan, China, some scientists argue.\n\nAnother theory, that SARS-CoV-2 first infected staff who were doing research on coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, cannot be ruled out. Two intelligence community agencies say they cannot determine the origins of the pandemic, and another two say a laboratory-associated incident is the most likely explanation. However, there remains no evidence that WIV was doing research on SARS-CoV-2 or a close progenitor.\n\nIf the virus did come from WIV, scientists have said, it is unlikely that it was bioengineered. “Almost all” agencies agree that SARS-CoV-2 was not genetically engineered, according to an intelligence community report, and all the agencies “assess that SARS-CoV-2 was not developed as a biological weapon.”\n\nIn a June 16 appearance on the Hill’s “Rising,” Kennedy named a WIV scientist who was supposedly among the first humans to become ill with COVID-19. But as we have written before, the scientist in question has denied being ill at the time, and the intelligence community report states that information on sick WIV researchers “neither supports nor refutes either hypothesis of the pandemic’s origins.”\n\nKennedy also has said, including on “Rising” and in the Watters interview, that the National Institutes of Health taught WIV scientists how to engineer viruses as bioweapons and funded research at WIV.\n\nAs we have said, there is agreement among scientists and intelligence community agencies that SARS-CoV-2 was not engineered as a bioweapon. We have previously covered the lengthy discussion about whether WIV’s work on genetically engineered chimeric viruses, indirectly funded by the NIH, constituted “gain-of-function” research. But regardless, the viruses being used were not similar enough to SARS-CoV-2 to have had anything to do with causing the pandemic.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 23: Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign on Aug. 23 and encouraged his supporters in key swing states to vote for former President Donald Trump.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/misconceptions/quarantine-and-lockdown/', 'Headline': 'Quarantine and Lockdown Archives - FactCheck.org', 'Snippet': 'Plenty of peer-reviewed studies have found government restrictions early in the pandemic, such as business closures and physical distancing measures, reduced COVID-19 cases and/or mortality ...', 'Full_text': 'Plenty of peer-reviewed studies have found government restrictions early in the pandemic, such as business closures and physical distancing measures, reduced COVID-19 cases and/or mortality, compared with what would have happened without those measures.

Civil liberties at their most basic are personal freedoms and the ability to avoid governmental intrusion on those freedoms. Mandates put restraints on those civil liberties. The question then becomes what is a restraint that is acceptable and what is a restraint that is unacceptable. Examples of mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic deemed legally acceptable include lockdowns, mask requirements under certain conditions, and shutdowns of venues.\n\nThe reasons for such measures, which legal scholars would refer to as a restraint or restriction on individuals’ civil liberties, are grounded in the responsibility of the government to protect those same individuals who believe their civil liberties are being restricted, and society as a whole, from harm, in this case, COVID-19.\n\nAccording to research by Xiaoshuang Liu et. al., in the article “Differential impact of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions on COVID-19 epidemics in the United States,” interventions such as mask mandates, gathering bans, and non-essential business closures, while having a restriction on civil liberties, safeguarded the public and their health. The study looked at nine different interventions in terms of their capacity to control COVID-19. Stay at home orders were the most effective at controlling COVID-19. Restricting gathering sizes, closing non-essential businesses, and face masks were also found by the study researchers to be effective in reducing COVID-19 rates. The researchers concluded that such restrictions “played critical roles on epidemic control in the U.S. in the past several months.”\n\nOne of the most important legal cases regarding public health and civil liberties is Jacobson v. Massachusetts 197, U.S. 11 (1905). On July 17, 1902, the board of health of Cambridge, Massachusetts set a deadline for all individuals residing in the city to either be vaccinated or re-vaccinated for the disease of smallpox. Those who did not comply were sentenced to pay a fine of $5. The plaintiff in the case, Henning Jacobson, refused to get vaccinated and was forced to pay a $5 fine. The court in the Jacobson case focused on several issues, including the role of the government at the local level to safeguard the public, and requirements that the government can put on individuals to keep everyone safe, but what we have not seen is forced vaccinations of individuals by the government.\n\nAccording to the Jacobson court, “the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint.”\n\nIn fact, government mandates around public health are deeply rooted in American history. Phillips v. City of New York, 775 F. 3d 538 (2015) upheld a law requiring that all children going to school in the City of New York are required to be vaccinated in order to attend public school unless they meet a religious exemption. \u200b\u200bThe plaintiffs in the case argued that New York’s requirement that all children be vaccinated in order to attend public school was unconstitutional. Under the New York Public Health Law section 2164(7)(a) “[n]o principal, teacher, owner or person in charge of a school shall permit any child to be admitted to such school, or to attend such school, in excess of fourteen days” without evidence that the child has been immunized. The court in the case concluded that the New York Public Health Law was constitutional, the statute permissible, and the safeguards of protecting the public an important state interest.\n\nUltimately, while mandates can be a tool in ensuring compliance with necessary public health measures, according to researcher and author Anudeep Pant in an interview with the AmNews, “[t]here are several ways to combat vaccine hesitancy. Since we know some of the measures of vaccine hesitancy, these data points should be utilized to develop pointed interventions. For example, public health officials can get ahead of false narratives by monitoring misinformation that is circulating in their communities and developing education campaigns tailored to fill knowledge gaps and clarify misconceptions. Since different communities will have different reasons for refusing vaccination, specialized public health campaigns are key, this is no one-size-fits-all solution.”\n\n“Lastly, partnerships between local trusted leaders, faith-based leaders, local politicians, healthcare workers, social workers, culture bearers, scientists…can be a powerful tool when everyone is working toward the same goal. The background and expertise of each stakeholder will be diverse so complementary knowledge, skills, and experience can create grassroots movements that can be critical in tipping the scale,” he added.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://health.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2022-02-02/a-johns-hopkins-study-says-ill-founded-lockdowns-did-little-to-limit-covid-deaths', 'Headline': ""A Johns Hopkins study says 'ill-founded' COVID lockdowns did more harm ..."", 'Snippet': 'Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have concluded that lockdowns have done little to reduce COVID deaths but have had “devastating effects” on economies and numerous social ills.

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years.

After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe.

Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://apnews.com/article/durham-report-fbi-trump-clinton-2016-campaign-f3039e651eeb35a09091c363419e6766', 'Headline': ""Durham report takeaways: A 'seriously flawed' Russia investigation and ..."", 'Snippet': 'A 306-page report by Justice Department special counsel John Durham is refocusing negative attention on one of the most politically significant investigations in FBI history: the probe into whether Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign was colluding with Russia to tip the outcome of the election.

Flawed research by a former British spy tasked with a sensitive, and political, assignment. And an FBI scrambling against the election-season clock to untangle suspicions about foreign government collusion that it feared could have grave national security implications.\n\nA 306-page report by Justice Department special counsel John Durham is refocusing negative attention on one of the most politically significant investigations in FBI history: the probe into whether Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign was conspiring with Russia to tip the outcome of the election.\n\nThe findings aren’t flattering for the FBI, with Durham asserting that it rushed into the investigation without an adequate basis and routinely ignored or rationalized evidence that undercut its premise. The report catalogs a series of errors — though many were already documented years ago by a separate Justice Department inspector general report, and the FBI says it’s taken several dozen corrective steps on its own.\n\nA look at some of the major findings of the Durham report.\n\nA ‘SERIOUSLY FLAWED’ INVESTIGATION\n\nThe report devotes considerable space to the FBI’s decision to open, on July 31, 2016, an investigation into possible criminal collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nThe probe was initiated after it learned from an Australian diplomat that a Trump campaign associate named George Papadopoulos had claimed to know that Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of emails. By that point, it was well known that Russian operatives had hacked Democratic emails, and Trump had even appeared to publicly invite Moscow to go looking for Clinton’s communications.\n\nBut, according to Durham, the FBI rushed into the probe without having any evidence that anyone from the Trump campaign had had any contact with any Russian intelligence officers. It identifies by name the Russia experts in the FBI and other agencies who were never consulted before the investigation was begun and says that had they been, they would have said there was no information pointing to a conspiracy between Russia and the campaign.\n\nThe report contends that the FBI fell prone to “confirmation bias,” repeatedly ignoring, minimizing or rationalizing away evidence that undercut the premise of collusion, including a conversation in which Papadopoulos vigorously denied knowing about any cooperative relationship between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nIt also says investigators did not corroborate a “single substantive allegation” in a dossier of Democratic-funded research that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, and yet continued to cite it in applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.\n\nBUT DID IT UNCOVER ‘THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY’ AS TRUMP PREDICTED?\n\nNo, it did not. Despite identifying abundant errors, the report and the broader investigation failed to live up to Trump’s hype. The former president claimed that it would reveal the “crime of the century” and expose a “deep state conspiracy” by high-ranking government officials to derail his candidacy and later his presidency.\n\nBut the report yielded only one conviction — a guilty plea from a little-known FBI employee — and the only two other cases that were brought both ended in acquittals at trial. And though Durham accused the FBI of confirmation bias, he did not allege that political bias or partisanship were guiding factors for the FBI’s actions.\n\n‘RIGOR, OBJECTIVITY AND PROFESSIONALISM’\n\nThe FBI responded to criticism of its actions by noting that the conduct occurred under different FBI leadership, months before current Director Christopher Wray took the top job. It also said it had already taken dozens of corrective measures designed to prevent the same problems from recurring.\n\nThose include steps designed to ensure the accuracy of applications the FBI files with the secretive surveillance court when it wants to eavesdrop on the communications of suspected spies and terrorists. For instance, the FBI said, agents must now provide more information, including identifying and disclosing evidence that might undercut their premise that probable cause exists for surveillance. In addition, the FBI has worked to improve oversight of confidential human sources.\n\nThe FBI said in a letter to Durham that it was confident that had those steps been in place in 2016, the “failures detailed in your Report never would have happened.” In a separate statement, it said the report “reinforces the importance of ensuring the FBI continues to do its work with the rigor, objectivity, and professionalism the American people deserve and rightly expect.“\n\nWAS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TREATED DIFFERENTLY?\n\nYes, Durham argues. He notes that the FBI in 2016 also investigated allegations in the book “Clinton Cash,” authored by a conservative writer who alleged foreign governments were funneling money to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for access. Both Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, and former President Bill Clinton have long denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe FBI labeled its reviews linked to “Clinton Cash” as “preliminary investigations,” Durham said. But the Trump Russia probe, he said, “was immediately opened as a full investigation despite the fact that it was similarly predicated on unvetted hearsay information.”\n\nHe argues the FBI showed caution about possibly influencing Hillary Clinton’s campaign that it did not show for Trump’s campaign.\n\nTo underscore his point, he quotes some of the text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, whose privately expressed dislike for Trump has long been cited as evidence of bias.\n\n“One more thing: (Clinton) may be our next president,” Page is said to have written Strzok. “The last thing you need (is) going in there loaded for bear. You think she’s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi?”\n\nAN UPHILL CLIMB IN CONGRESS GETS STEEPER\n\nThe Durham report is another blow to the FBI as it’s trying to persuade Congress that it is a responsible steward of intelligence.\n\nLawmakers are beginning to debate whether to renew a U.S. surveillance program that captures huge swaths of foreigners’ emails and phone calls. The program authorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act expires at the end of this year.\n\nThe Durham report calls attention to mistakes that Republicans have already cited as reasons for overhauling Section 702. The FBI did not use Section 702 in surveilling Page. But its omissions before the primary surveillance court have long rankled Republicans, who have signaled they won’t renew Section 702 without changes targeting the FBI.\n\n“It is essential that Congress codifies clear guardrails that prevent future FBI abuses and restores the public’s trust in our law enforcement institutions,” said Rep. Mike Turner, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, in a statement.\n\nA significant number of Democrats, meanwhile, separately want limits on when the FBI can search foreign surveillance data collected under Section 702.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-did-it-robby-mook-michael-sussmann-donald-trump-russia-collusion-alfa-bank-11653084709', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton Did It - WSJ - The Wall Street Journal', 'Snippet': 'The Russia-Trump collusion narrative of 2016 and beyond was a dirty trick for the ages, and now we know it came from the top—candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.

In one instance, according to the report, FBI headquarters and Justice Department officials “required defensive briefings to be provided to Clinton and other officials or candidates who appeared to be the targets of foreign interference.”\n\nIn another, the FBI “elected to end an investigation after one of its longtime and valuable confidential human sources went beyond what was authorized and made an improper and possibly illegal financial contribution to the Clinton campaign on behalf of a foreign entity as a precursor to a much larger donation being contemplated.” And in a third example related to investigating the Clinton Foundation, both senior FBI and DOJ officials “placed restrictions on how those matters were to be handled such that essentially no investigative activities occurred for months leading up to the election.”\n\nDurham also pointed to the “markedly different” handling of the Trump investigation and Clinton’s private email server.\n\nThe special counsel also singled out Marc Elias for criticism. Elias was the Clinton campaign’s general counsel in 2016 and hired the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which hired Steele. Elias met with Steele in 2016 and periodically briefed the campaign about the findings from Fusion and Steele. The lawyer also coordinated closely with Michael Sussmann, his former Perkins Coie law firm colleague, on anti-Trump research in 2016. Sussmann had been charged by Durham with making false statements. However, he was found not guilty in 2022.\n\nThe dossier and Russian disinformation\n\nDurham said, “Within days of their receipt, the unvetted and unverified Steele Reports were used to support probable cause in the FBI’s FISA applications targeting” targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page.\n\nThe special counsel noted: “This was done at a time when the FBI knew that the same information Steele had provided to the FBI had also been fed to the media and others.”\n\n“Our investigation determined that the Crossfire Hurricane investigators did not and could not corroborate any of the substantive allegations contained in the Steele reporting,” Durham wrote. “Nor was Steele able to produce corroboration for any of the reported allegations, even after being offered $1 million or more by the FBI for such corroboration.”\n\nDurham concluded, “Russian intelligence knew of Steele’s election investigation for the Clinton campaign by no later than early July 2016” and “Steele’s sources may have been compromised by the Russians at a time prior to the creation of the Steele Reports and throughout the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane investigation.”\n\nThe report also said dossier source Igor Danchenko provided Steele with “rumor and speculation.” Durham charged Russian analyst Danchenko. However, he was found not guilty last year.\n\nNo collusion\n\nDurham’s report assessed “neither U.S. law enforcement nor the intelligence community appears to have possessed any actual evidence of collusion in their holdings at the commencement of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,” and the FBI then “discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support the narrative of a collusive relationship between Trump and Russia.”\n\nThe special counsel noted the claims in British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier “would eventually fall apart, but not before it had been continuously adopted by the FBI as supportive of its underlying theory regarding collusion.”\n\nDurham added that when ex-Obama Director of National Intelligence James Clapper spoke with the special counsel’s office, he: “Advised that he knew of no direct evidence that would meet the legal standard of conspiracy or collusion on Trump’s part.”\n\nThe special counsel also said Adm. Mike Rogers, who served as the director of the National Security Agency during the relevant time period, told them “he did not recall any intelligence that supported the collusion assertions.” Durham also concluded former Obama CIA Director John Brennan similarly likely “had no actual knowledge of such information.”\n\nThe special counsel also pointed out since-fired FBI agent Peter Strzok said in May 2017 he was hesitating to join the Mueller investigation “in part, because of my gut sense and concern there’s no big there there.” Durham wrote: “Although the ‘there’ does not appear to have been explicitly identified, it may well have been a reference to the Russia-Trump collusion investigation.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nNo further crimes charged\n\nDurham has obtained one guilty plea during the investigation from FBI ex-lawyer Kevin Clinesmith. Clinesmith pleaded guilty to falsifying a document during the bureau’s efforts to renew FISA surveillance against Carter Page. Durham brought charges against Sussmann and Danchenko but was unsuccessful with both at trial.\n\nThe special counsel didn’t charge anyone else in his new report.\n\n“The law does not always make a person’s bad judgment, even horribly bad judgment, standing alone, a crime. Nor does the law criminalize all unseemly or unethical conduct that political campaigns might undertake for tactical advantage, absent a violation of a particular federal criminal statute,” Durham wrote. “If this report and the outcome of the Special Counsel’s investigation leave some with the impression that injustices or misconduct have gone unaddressed, it is not because the Office concluded that no such injustices or misconduct occurred. It is, rather, because not every injustice or transgression amounts to a criminal offense, and criminal prosecutors are tasked exclusively with investigating and prosecuting violations of U.S. criminal laws.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/03/hillary-clinton-dnc-fined-by-fec-over-trump-russia-collusion-hoax/', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton, DNC fined by FEC over Trump-Russia collusion hoax', 'Snippet': 'Clinton was fined $8,000 and the DNC was fined $105,000.

Durham said the dossier was “unvetted and unverified,” yet was used as justification for surveillance.\n\n“Indeed, based on the evidence gathered in multiple exhaustive and costly federal investigations of these matters, including the instant investigation, neither U.S. law enforcement nor the Intelligence Community appears to have possessed any actual evidence of collusion in their holdings at the commencement of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,"" the report stated.\n\nThe political implications are clear, and the report highlights the favoritism shown to the Clinton campaign over Trump’s.\n\nGive Biden family the Trump treatment\n\nAs Durham details, the FBI fumbled the “collusion” investigation.

Other FBI officials described rookie mistakes that undercut the bureau’s brief inquiry into a possible Trump-Russia internet backchannel. At closing arguments during one of last year’s trials, Durham told jurors that “the FBI failed” on many occasions.\n\nRead more about the report.\n\nSpecial Counsel John Durham’s report details his investigation of a purported effort by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign to tie Donald Trump to Russia – and Durham concluded that it “did not, all things considered, amount to a provable criminal offense.”\n\nDurham reveals in a footnote that he interviewed Clinton in May 2022 as part of the probe. The investigation was looking into whether any crimes occurred in the handling of an uncorroborated piece of US intelligence indicating the Russians knew of a Clinton campaign plan to vilify her opponent, Trump, by tying him to Russia.\n\nThe 2016 intelligence got the attention of then CIA Director John Brennan, who briefed the Obama White House and referred the issue to the FBI.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe released some of Brennan’s notes about the intelligence used in his briefing of former President Barack Obama.\n\nRatcliffe publicly said that the intelligence community never corroborated the Russian claims of a Clinton Plan to frame Trump, and didn’t know whether it was fabricated.\n\nBut Durham believes the uncorroborated intelligence should have at least made the FBI question whether it was being used by a political opponent to pursue allegations against the Trump campaign, the report shows.\n\nIn her interview with Durham’s investigators, Clinton expressed sympathy for Durham’s hunt. She calls it, “really sad,” adding “I get it, you have to go down every rabbit hole.”\n\nShe called the intelligence that was consuming Durham’s time bogus, saying it “looked like Russian disinformation to me.”\n\nA spokesman for Clinton didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nDurham concludes that it would be impossible to prosecute anyone for their handling of the Clinton Plan intelligence. He said it “amounted to a significant intelligence failure,” but not a crime.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham concluded that the FBI should have never launched a full investigation into connections between Donald Trump’s campaign associates and Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nThe bureau does have a distinction between the types of investigations it can launch — and having a full probe allowed agents to use broader surveillance tools when looking into the Trump team Russia.\n\nHere’s the difference between a full FBI investigation — which Durham has criticized in the Trump-Russia probe — and a preliminary investigation.\n\nA preliminary investigation requires a lower threshold to open than a full investigation, and for that reason also means the agents can’t use more invasive tools like Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants and other court authorized surveillance.\n\nSpecifically, according to the FBI’s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide, during a preliminary investigation:\n\nAn agent must have “information or allegation” of a federal crime being committed or about to be committed.\n\nIt requires a relatively low threshold to open.\n\nThe investigation can only be open for six months without the agent running the case taking one of three actions: seeking a renewal, converting it to a Full investigation if authorized, or closing the case.\n\nCannot use intrusive tools like FISA and other electronic surveillance.\n\nA full investigation is more extensive and agents have access to more tools. During a full investigation:\n\nAn agent must have an “articulable factual basis” that a crime has or is about to occur in order to open the case. It’s a relatively high standard to open requiring more than merely an allegation of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nNo timeline for the investigation, but typically assessed by FBI supervisors annually to determine whether it should remain open.\n\nAll lawful tools, including intrusive surveillance allowed.\n\nBottom line, if the FBI had opened the investigation into the Trump-Russia probe as a preliminary vs. a full one, they would not have been permitted to use the host of FISA tools that ultimately became the subject of scrutiny by Durham, the Trump team, and DOJ’s inspector general. Opening the case as a preliminary investigation would have also limited the amount of information the FBI could collect as it sought to uncover potential ties between members of the Trump team and Russia.\n\nFormer Attorney General William Barr tapped special counsel John Durham in 2019 to review the origins of the Russia probe, and the scope of Durham’s work grew over the years.\n\nHe scrutinized the FBI’s handling of the Steele dossier, leaks of classified information about Trump-Russia contacts, and possible CIA misconduct regarding its analysis of Russian meddling, among other topics.\n\nLargely, his inquiry seemed to always zero in on former President Donald Trump’s political opponents and perceived enemies.\n\nWhen Durham began his probe, he was seen as an apolitical truth-seeker with a knack for investigating complex cases, including government scandals.\n\nBut that reputation waned over the years, especially after Durham took the unprecedented step of publicly rebuking the Justice Department inspector general after the watchdog released a report finding that the FBI’s decision to open the Trump-Russia probe was legally justified and untainted by bias.\n\nBoth Barr and Durham were publicly critical of the December 2019 inspector general report on the FBI’s Russia investigation.\n\nThat report contained blistering criticisms of FBI’s reliance on an unverified opposition research dossier on Trump and Russia and the FISA warrants that cited the dossier’s allegations, but Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote he did not find “documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the decisions” to open investigations that initially focused on four Trump campaign aides and advisers.\n\nFormer special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which inherited the initial Russia probe, released a detailed accounting of Russia’s effort to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nMueller found no evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but investigators documented numerous contacts between Trump associates and Russians.\n\nThe final Mueller report did not rely on the opposition research dossier.\n\nThe FBI has made reforms to the way it obtains warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in light of the inspector general’s report — which led to FBI invalidating two of the four warrants it obtained on the Trump campaign adviser – as well as a follow up investigation revealing widespread problems with FISA court applications.\n\nIn congressional testimony in 2020, FBI Director Chris Wray said that the FBI had implemented more than 40 changes aimed at making the FISA process more stringent in response to Horowitz’s report.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham scrutinized the FBI’s handling of the dossier, leaks of classified information about Trump-Russia contacts and possible CIA misconduct regarding its analysis of Russian meddling, among other topics during the course of his investigation.\n\nBut, he only pressed forward with two trials during his probe, both ending in acquittal.\n\nBefore the 2020 election, Barr elevated Durham to “special counsel” status, further protecting his position and making it politically difficult for the Biden-run Justice Department to control or shut down the investigation.\n\nDuring the trials, Trump and his allies continued to make bold predictions about what would be uncovered in the probe, particularly after Durham released vague allegations through court filings. Trump last year told Fox News that Durham was exposing the “crime of the century.”\n\nHis case against Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann ended with an acquittal in May. Durham charged Sussmann with lying to a top FBI official in September 2016 while passing along a tip about Trump’s ties to Russia. Sussmann’s lawyers accused Durham of bullying witnesses into changing their story and cherry-picking evidence to fuel claims of an anti-Trump conspiracy. After his acquittal, Sussmann said he was “falsely accused” by Durham.\n\nIn October, Durham personally oversaw his trial against Trump-Russia dossier source Igor Danchenko, who was charged with lying to the FBI about his sub-sourcing. Durham handled most of the arguments and witness questioning, but things quickly got off the rails.\n\nHe attacked his own witnesses when they helped the defense, and the judge threw out one of the five charges mid-trial. The Virginia jury reached “not guilty” verdicts on all remaining counts.\n\nJohn Durham, the special counsel who led the investigation into potential misconduct in the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe, has made a career of investigating high-profile public corruption.\n\nIn a 300-plus page report, the Trump administration appointee determined that the FBI should never have launched its investigation into connections between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, according to the report compiled over three years and released on Monday.\n\nDurham, 73, was appointed to serve as special counsel in October 2020 by then-Attorney General William Barr. He previously was the Justice Department’s top prosecutor in Connecticut — a position he was appointed to in 2017 and left in 2021.\n\nDurham became a lawyer in 1975. He is known for having handled high-profile, sensitive investigations in both Democratic and Republican administrations during his decadeslong career with the Justice Department.\n\nHe was appointed by then-Attorney General Janet Reno in 1999 to investigate corruption surrounding the use of FBI informants in Boston, and later by then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey to investigate the CIA’s destruction of videotapes of detainee interrogations in 2008. Durham closed the latter probe without bringing any charges.\n\nIn addition to his work as a special prosecutor, Durham has extensive experience as a trial lawyer. He went after gangs in New Haven, prosecuted mob figures, and secured a guilty plea from former Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, a Republican who admitted to corruption.\n\nThough the new special counsel report levies criticism after criticism of how the FBI handled the Trump-Russia probe, John Durham is not recommending “any wholesale changes” to the agency’s — or Justice Department — guidelines or policies.\n\nThe report, Durham writes, is meant to capture the findings of the special counsel investigation and to “assist the Attorney General in determining how the Department and the FBI can do a better, more credible job.”\n\nDurham however did float a proposal to create a career position for a nonpartisan FBI lawyer or agent who would be tasked with challenging steps taken in “politically sensitive investigations,” including surveillance warrant applications.\n\nDurham said he was not proposing any changes to FBI policies in a conclusion to the report’s executive summary, where he claimed that the FBI “failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to the law.”\n\nThe report asserts that “the answer is not the creation of new rules but a renewed fidelity to the old.”\n\nHis report says there is a need for the FBI to recognize that there was a “lack of analytical rigor, apparent confirmation bias, and an over-willingness to rely on information from individuals connected to political opponents.”\n\nThe FBI agents who worked on the surveillance applications for the Trump campaign aide Carter Page, Durham claims, showed “cavalier attitude towards accuracy and completeness,” as they allegedly disregarded requirements for renewing the warrants.\n\nFBI personnel, Durham writes, displayed a “serious lack of analytical rigor towards the information that they received, especially information received from politically affiliated persons and entities,” and that information contributed to both the launch the FBI’s initial probe and the opening of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.\n\n“The Department did not adequately examine or question these materials and the motivations of those providing them, even when at about the same time the Director of the FBI and others learned of significant and potentially contrary intelligence,” Durham writes.\n\nEven if hindsight is clearer, the report says, “much of this also seems to have been clear at the time.”\n\nUsing harsh language, special counsel John Durham claims in his report that the FBI deviated from his previous approach to foreign election interference matters in how it opened, with the Trump appointed-prosecutor touting how the FBI treated matters related to former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic White House nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nDurham zeroed in on former FBI Deputy Director Andre McCabe and Peter Strzok, the ex-deputy director of the counter-intelligence division,\n\n“Strzok, at a minimum, had pronounced hostile feelings toward Trump,” Durham wrote, while quoting in a footnote previously known texts between Strzok and Lisa Page, then an FBI attorney.\n\nDurham knocked the FBI for failing to take several steps before launching the Trump campaign investigations, such as interviewing relevant witnesses, reviewing its own intelligence databases, for or using “any of the standard analytical tools typically employed by the FBI in evaluating raw intelligence.”\n\nDurham suggested that if the FBI had taken those steps, it would have found that US intelligence agencies did not have any evidence tying Trump to Russian leadership officials.\n\nThe report cites for comparison examples of how the FBI approached investigations concerning Hillary Clinton. Durham points to specifically to “highly significant intelligence” the FBI “received from a trusted foreign source pointing to a Clinton campaign plan to vilify Trump by tying him to Vladimir Putin so as to divert attention from her own concerns relating to her use of a private email server.”\n\n“Unlike the FBI’s opening of a full investigation of unknown members of the Trump campaign based on raw, uncorroborated information, in this separate matter involving a purported Clinton campaign plan, the FBI never opened any type of inquiry, issued any taskings, employed any analytical personnel, or produced any analytical products in connection with the information,” the report said.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham’s report is critical of the Steele dossier, an explosive document that had been used by the FBI to bolster its case for probable cause to secure surveillance warrants against a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\n“As noted, it was not until mid-September that the Crossfire Hurricane investigators received several of the Steele Reports. Within days of their receipt, the unvetted and unverified Steele Reports were used to support probable cause in the FBI’s FISA applications targeting (Carter) Page, a U.S. citizen who, for a period of time, had been an advisor to Trump,” the report says.\n\n“As discussed later in the report, this was done at a time when the FBI knew that the same information Steele had provided to the FBI had also been fed to the media and others in Washington, D.C.,” it added.\n\nThe Steele dossier contained unverified allegations about Trump’s connections to Russia, including his alleged business dealings, rumors of lurid trysts in Moscow and claims that his campaign collaborated with the Kremlin in 2016.\n\nTrump vehemently denied the claims, and Steele’s work has lost a significant amount of credibility over the years. Today, the dossier is largely seen as an unproven collection of rumors and gossip.\n\n“As noted, the FBI attempted, over time, to investigate and analyze the Steele Reports but ultimately was not able to confirm or corroborate any of the substantive allegations contained in those reports. In the context of these efforts, and as discussed in (the report), the FBI learned that Steele relied primarily on a U.S.-based Russian national, Igor Danchenko, to collect information that ultimately formed the core allegations found in the reports,” the report reads.\n\n“Specifically, our investigation discovered that Danchenko himself had told another person that he (Danchenko) was responsible for 80% of the intel” and 50% of the analysis contained in the Steele Dossier,” it adds.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham concluded that the FBI should never have launched its full investigation into connections between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, according to a report compiled over three years by the Trump-administration appointee and released on Monday.\n\nDurham’s 300-plus page report also states that the FBI used “raw, unanalyzed, and uncorroborated intelligence,” to launch the “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation into Trump and Russia but used a different standard when weighing concerns about alleged election interference regarding Hillary Clinton’s campaign.\n\nThe special counsel, however, did not recommend any new charges against individuals or “wholesale changes” about how the FBI handles politically charged investigations, despite strongly criticizing the agency’s behavior.\n\nThe report also concludes that “at least on the part of certain personnel intimately involved in the matter” there was “a predisposition to open an investigation into Trump.”\n\nDurham’s findings that the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign should not have happened are at odds with a previous Justice Department inspector general investigation into the FBI’s Russia probe, which identified problems with the investigation but concluded in December 2019 there was sufficient justification to open the inquiry.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland sent Durham’s report to congressional lawmakers and released the report on Monday.\n\nIn a letter to Congress accompanying the report, Garland said, “Special Counsel Durham’s unclassified report is attached in full as submitted to me, without any additions, redactions, or other modifications.”\n\nDurham’s conclusions condemning the FBI’s investigation into Trump is sure to fuel the debate about Russia, Trump, the FBI and the 2016 presidential election that is still swirling more than six years after and as Trump is campaigning once again for the White House.\n\nThe investigation was launched in May 2019 by Trump’s former Attorney General William Barr — a probe that Trump and his right-wing allies repeatedly predicted would “investigate the investigators” and lead to bombshell indictments of those who scrutinized the former president. Four years later, Durham’s investigation yielded one minor conviction, two losses at trial and a probe that fell short of the lofty goals set by the former president.\n\nDurham only secured one conviction: the guilty plea of a low-level FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, who avoided jail after admitting to doctoring an email about a surveillance warrant. Durham’s other two prosecutions — against a Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer and the primary source for the Trump-Russia dossier — ended with embarrassing acquittals.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham has released a report on his office’s investigation into wrongdoing in the Trump-Russia probe.\n\nThe FBI opened the initial Russia investigation, codenamed “Crossfire Hurricane,” in late July 2016. Special counsel Robert Mueller inherited that investigation in May 2017, and he wrapped up his work in March 2019. In all, that means the Justice Department spent about two years and eight months investigating the connections between Trump’s campaign and the Russian government.\n\nAs Mueller wrapped up his work in the spring of 2019, then-Attorney General Bill Barr tapped Durham to “investigate the investigators” and review the origins of the FBI’s Russia probe\n\nBarr upgraded Durham to “special counsel” status shortly before the 2020 election, making it politically harder for the incoming Biden-run Justice Department to shut down Durham’s team if they wanted to. Garland has let Durham continue, despite complaints from liberal commentators and Durham’s targets that he is twisting the law in furtherance of a Trump-friendly political agenda.\n\nProsecutions: In all, Durham has prosecuted just three people: Igor Danchenko, a Russian analyst who was a source for the 2016 dossier of allegations about Trump, the acquitted Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann and a low-level FBI lawyer named Kevin Clinesmith.\n\nThere are reports that Durham’s team also looked into a wide range of other matters that former President Donald Trump has publicly complained about – without bringing any charges. This includes potential wrongdoing by the CIA and other parts of the US intelligence community, on topics related to Russia’s pro-Trump interference in the 2016 election.\n\nDurham’s team has spent nearly $4.5 million since October 2020, according to financial data released by the Justice Department. The cost of Durham’s first year and half of work, when he was a US attorney and not a special counsel, has not been disclosed.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/may/17/durham-report-criticized-elements-of-fbis-investig/', 'Headline': 'Durham’s report on the Trump-Russia probes, explained', 'Snippet': 'Mueller’s report reaffirmed the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that Russia favored Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it did not find that the Kremlin’s acts on Trump’s behalf ...', 'Full_text': 'The long-awaited findings of Special Counsel John Durham’s May 15 report provide some support to long-standing claims from many conservatives — including former President Donald Trump — that the investigation into Trump’s 2016 campaign was overblown and lacked strong evidence.\n\nDurham’s report, based on his investigation that began in 2019, suggested that the FBI acted on unanalyzed, unconfirmed intelligence to move too quickly to open a full investigation, rather than a preliminary one, into the Trump-Russia collusion allegations.\n\nDurham didn’t conclude that the FBI shouldn’t have investigated the allegations at all. But his report fell short of bringing a flurry of criminal convictions, which had been predicted to follow the probe of what Trump called ""the crime of the century"" within U.S. law enforcement.\n\nThe investigation led to one conviction and two trials, both of which resulted in acquitals. A former FBI lawyer pleaded guilty to altering an email from the CIA that was used as evidence when investigators sought court permission to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nWhat did the more-than-300-page Durham report conclude after investigators conducted more than 480 interviews, served more than 190 subpoenas and reviewed more than 1 million documents? Here’s what we know.\n\nWho is Durham and what was he investigating?\n\nDurham was a special counsel appointed to investigate the FBI’s and Justice Department’s probes into the Trump campaign.\n\nIn 2019, Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, assigned Durham to investigate whether the FBI or other government agencies violated the law when looking into possible links between then-presidential candidate Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. In October 2020, Barr appointed Durham as a special counsel on the investigation, but Barr kept that appointment secret until December 2020 to avoid interfering with the 2020 presidential election.\n\nA special counsel is a semi-independent attorney tapped to investigate and potentially prosecute a case when it presents a possible conflict of interest for the Justice Department, or ""where it’s deemed to be in the public interest to have someone outside the government come in and take responsibility for a matter,"" The Associated Press reported.\n\nDurham was set to investigate the origins of the FBI’s Trump campaign investigation, which began in summer 2016, and the investigation by special counsel Robert. S. Mueller that began in 2017.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham, the prosecutor appointed to investigate potential government wrongdoing in the early days of the Trump-Russia probe, leaves federal court in Washington, May 16, 2022. (AP)\n\nDid the Durham report determine that the FBI should have never opened an investigation at all?\n\nDurham’s report suggested that the FBI moved too quickly to open a full investigation, but stopped short of denouncing the FBI’s and Justice Department’s decisions to investigate.\n\nDurham wrote, ""There is no question that the FBI had an affirmative obligation to closely examine"" intelligence provided by the Australian government, which said its diplomats had heard George Papadopoulos, a Trump adviser, make alarming statements related to Russia. Papadopoulos served 12 days in prison for lying about his attempts to allegedly connect other Trump campaign staff with officials representing Russia. He was pardoned by Trump near the end of Trump’s presidency.\n\nDurham wrote that it would have been a ""sensible step"" for the FBI to have opened a more narrowly focused preliminary investigation based on that intelligence — which Durham wrote was ""essentially the sole basis cited by the FBI for opening a full investigation.""\n\nPreliminary investigations, he wrote, are constrained by time limits and fewer approved investigation techniques.\n\nDurham’s report also recommended the FBI take additional steps to reform its investigation process. He proposed making an FBI official responsible for challenging the steps taken in politically sensitive investigations.\n\nResponding to the report, the FBI said the conduct Durham examined was the reason agency leadership implemented corrective actions some time ago, although that time period isn’t specifically defined. If such reforms had been in place in 2016, the agency said, the missteps Durham identified could have been prevented.\n\nDid the Durham report vindicate Trump’s claims that the investigation into his campaign was a baseless ""witch hunt""?\n\nDurham\'s report found that the investigation into Trump\'s campaign was triggered by uncorroborated intelligence that should have been scrutinized more intensely before a full investigation was launched.\n\nBut the report did not conclude that the investigation was entirely baseless and illegitimate.\n\nTrump has long referred to the investigation into potential collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russia as a ""witch hunt"" conducted without evidence. The former president has also often claimed that the collusion allegations were a ""hoax.""\n\nDurham’s report supports the underlying elements of Trump’s sometimes-exaggerated claims. Durham concluded that the FBI moved too quickly to open an investigation based on ""raw, unanalyzed, uncorroborated intelligence."" Durham also wrote that the agency had relied significantly on investigative leads provided or funded by Trump’s political opponents — without adequately questioning the motivations of the people providing the information.\n\nDurham emphasized the need for heightened scrutiny and analysis.\n\nWhen the FBI’s initial investigation was opened, ""neither U.S. law enforcement nor the Intelligence Community appears to have possessed any actual evidence of collusion in their holdings,"" Durham wrote.\n\nThe report concluded that senior FBI officials ""displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor"" toward the information received. Additionally, Durham wrote that ""apparent confirmation bias"" and ""an over-willingness to rely on information from individuals connected to political opponents"" resulted in investigators acting ""without appropriate objectivity or restraint"" when investigating the Trump-Russia collusion allegations.\n\nDurham’s report emphasized the role of confirmation bias in the investigation, rather than political bias. This meant that as the FBI investigated the Trump campaign, the agency ""discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support"" the collusion narrative, Durham wrote.\n\nThe report did, however, outline how the FBI’s response to allegations about the Trump campaign differed from the agency’s response to similar allegations about the Clinton campaign, including:\n\nThe FBI’s decision not to open an inquiry or have analytical personnel investigate ""intelligence it received from a trusted foreign source pointing to a Clinton campaign plan to vilify Trump by tying him to Vladimir Putin"" to divert attention from her own use of a private email server.\n\nProviding defensive briefings for Clinton and her staff when, during her 2016 presidential campaign, it had gathered evidence that foreign operatives were working to gain influence with her campaign. No defensive briefings were provided to the Trump campaign based on the Australian diplomat’s intelligence.\n\nDurham’s report is not the first criticism of the FBI’s investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. A 2019 report by the Justice Department’s inspector general criticized the FBI for ""serious performance failures"" during the investigation. Still, that report concluded that the agency acted without political bias and was justified in opening its investigation.\n\nDid the report clear Trump of ‘all wrongdoing’?\n\nDurham wasn’t tasked with clearing Trump of wrongdoing.\n\nDurham was asked to determine whether the FBI or others violated the law while investigating the Trump campaign.\n\nAfter the report was released, Trump’s allies and supporters claimed on social media that it exonerated Trump and cleared him of ""ALL wrongdoing."" But that wasn’t the purpose of Durham’s investigation. He was investigating the investigators, not Trump’s conduct.\n\nMueller’s investigation, not Durham’s, culminated in a 2019 report that cleared the Trump campaign of allegations that it conspired with Russia ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMueller’s report reaffirmed the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that Russia favored Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it did not find that the Kremlin’s acts on Trump’s behalf or the numerous contacts between the campaign and Russia amounted to criminal conspiracy or illegal coordination.\n\nMueller’s report detailed numerous occasions on which Trump tried to impede that investigation, but Mueller ultimately declined to say whether Trump’s actions obstructed justice. Barr concluded there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Trump for obstruction.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, announced May 15 that he invited Durham to testify at a hearing May 25.\n\nPolitiFact Staff Writer Loreben Tuquero contributed to this report.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/new-details-on-2016-russia-probe-prompt-flawed-allegations-of-espionage', 'Headline': 'New details on 2016 Russia probe prompt flawed allegations of ... - PBS', 'Snippet': ""Transcript Audio.

Durham alleges Sussmann lied to the FBI about who his client was during a meeting where Sussmann shared information about possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nBut in a few extra sentences, Durham\'s filing mentions a second instance where Sussmann tried to raise concerns of a Trump-Russia connection, this time apparently to the CIA. That information came from one of Sussmann\'s clients, technology executive Rodney Joffe.\n\nDurham\'s filing noted that Joffe\'s company, Neustar, had an arrangement to provide security-related work on computer servers, including the White House\'s. But, according to the filing, Joffe used that access to mine Internet data to establish an inference and narrative tying then-candidate Trump to Russia.\n\nJoffe has not been charged with any crime.\n\nAll of this has now been spun by conservative media and former President Trump himself to say Sussmann and Joffe were Clinton operatives who were paid to illegally hack into and spy on the Trump campaign and Trump White House.\n\nFormer President Trump wrote: ""In a stronger period of time in our country, this crime would have been punishable by death.""\n\nIn a column this week, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charlie Savage of The New York Times wrote that the entire narrative appeared to be mostly wrong or old news, and its conclusions ""based on a misleading presentation of the facts or outright misinformation.""\n\nCharlie Savage joins me now.\n\nI wonder if you could help us understand just initially how we got to this point, how Durham\'s investigation has morphed into this sort of explosive story in conservative media.\n\nCharlie Savage, The New York Times:\n\nSo, back in the Trump administration, right after Robert Mueller, the Russian special counsel, finished his report, Donald Trump shifted — tried to shift the narrative to or escalated his attempt to shift the narrative to the idea that he was actually a victim of a deep state conspiracy.\n\nAnd his attorney general, Bill Barr, as you mentioned, appointed John Durham, then a U.S. attorney, to be what became another special counsel, a special counsel to investigate the investigation.\n\nAnd the whole idea and expectation then was he was going to prove Trump\'s narrative that there were high-level officials who — in the FBI and the CIA who had essentially framed him for collusion.\n\nBut we\'re almost three years in now, and he has yet to bring any charges against the high-level officials. He has developed two cases against outsiders, and one of them is this Sussmann case. Both of these are merely false statement cases. They\'re not charging a conspiracy.\n\nBut Mr. Durham has used court filings and indictments and so forth, related to these cases to put out large amounts of information that are not directly related to the charges. And this information is imbued with insinuations that there is some kind of vast anti-Trump conspiracy.\n\nHe just hasn\'t been able to prove it yet or charge it. It all goes back to Hillary Clinton, is the implication.\n\nCharlie Savage:\n\nThere\'s been this repeated cycle of huge alarmism stoked within right-wing pro-Trump outlets that I don\'t really consider doing the same kind of journalism that I\'m doing sending out the message with the blaring outrage, grievance-stroking headlines that now it\'s been proven they were spying on President Trump.\n\nAnd every time you look at it, it — there\'s less there than meets the eye. But if you don\'t cover it, then that allows the sort of Trump world and his allies to say, aha, you know, the media, they\'re in on it. They\'re covering it up. It\'s a conspiracy.

Eventually, the judge stropped trying to control Trump – he and the attorney general’s lawyer questioning Trump let him rant, and then mostly disregarded the missives.\n\nThe high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. Engoron has already ruled Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The New York attorney general’s office said they will rest their case after Ivanka Trump’s testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand:\n\nTrump’s campaign comes to the courtroom: The former president’s rhetoric at times during his testimony might as well have been at one of his rallies in front of supporters. He went after the attorney general. The judge. And the “political witch hunt” that he’s been railing against for years now. On the witness stand, the charged rhetoric was even more remarkable, as he attacked the judge sitting right next to him, with James in the courtroom watching his testimony just feet away. “The fraud is on the court, not on me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump gets an angry response from the judge: Judge Engoron tried at the outset of Trump’s testimony to stop the former president from making speeches and instead answer the questions, but it did little to change Trump’s approach. The judge responded by threatening to remove Trump from the witness stand, though that didn’t deter the former president either. “This is not a political rally,” Engoron said to Trump, telling Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise to “control your client.”\n\nTrump acknowledges changing valuation of Trump Tower triplex: The attorney general’s office pressed Trump on the properties central to his identity and brand: Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and other key parts of his real estate empire. The AG’s office attorney Kevin Wallace also pressed Trump on why valuations of properties were changed, such as his Trump Tower triplex, which was devalued on his financial statement in 2017 after a Forbes article found he had dramatically exaggerated the size of the apartment. Trump acknowledged there had on occasion been mistakes, such as the Trump Tower apartment valuation.\n\nTrump’s descriptions of his properties: The former president’s rhetorical flourishes went beyond attacking those who are investigating him. He also took the opportunity to play salesman and play up his properties. One of his chief complaints about the judge is a citation in his decision that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18 million, a number based on Florida tax appraisal records “It’s much more valuable,” Trump said of Mar-a-Lago, “and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes, that it’s biggest value is using it as a club.” Wallace took the answer to pin him down on that valuation. “You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” Wallace asked. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here.\n\nTrump on whether he maintained accurate records from August 2014 onward: ""I hope so""\n\nWhen asked by the Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office whether he “maintained accurate books and records” from August 2014 going forward, Donald Trump said “I hope so.”\n\n“I hope so, I didn’t keep them myself. I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nJudge interrupts Trump\'s ""irrelevant"" answer to questions about Scotland golf course valuation\n\nAs testimony began centering on the valuation of Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland — Trump lobbed an answer that Judge Arthur Engoron audibly deemed “irrelevant” to the question.\n\nThe New York assistant attorney general asked Trump if the description in his 2014 financial statement was accurate for the property — which followed by Trump touting Aberdeen as a oil capitol making the property more valuable.\n\n“Irrelevant, irrelevant, answer the question,” Engoron said speaking over Trump, one of the few times that’s happened since returning from the break.\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to boast about the course.\n\nAs Trump gave a long-winded answer about the beauty of the course, Engoron said he would be following the assistant attorney general’s lead: “If you want to let the witness ramble on, non responsive, repeat himself.”\n\nThe assistant attorney general was trying, unsuccessfully, to get Trump to acknowledge a discrepancy on the number of properties that could be built in Aberdeen.\n\n“It’s sort of like a painting. You can do pretty much what you want to do. The land is there and you can do what you want to do,” Trump said.\n\nTrump questioned about the value of Mar-a-Lago\n\nDonald Trump says he believes Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\n“You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” asked Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nThe valuation of Mar-a-Lago has been one of Trump’s complaints about the judge in the trial, after the judge cited a Florida tax appraisal of $18 million for the property in his decision finding Trump, his adult sons and his company committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nWallace asked Trump if he approved of valuing Mar-a-Lago as if it would be sold to an individual as a resident. “Did I approve it on this? I don’t know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump replied, “I don’t remember that, no” when asked if he explicitly told former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg or former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney to value the property that way.\n\nWallace confronted Trump with a 2002 deed of development rights that shows Trump deeded away his right to use the property as anything other than a social club.\n\nTrump then gave a long aside about Mar-a-Lago when Wallace asked him about not being able to use it as anything but a social club.\n\n“I don’t mind leaving it as a club. In fact, if somebody wanted it, smartest thing to do, have a club and have one member and that would be the member that lives in the club. But it’s much more valuable — and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes — that its biggest value is using it as a club,” Trump said.\n\nWallace showed Trump a 2003 article in which the former president told a reporter Mar-A-Lago will always be a club.\n\n“I think that was said with bravado more than legal intent,” Trump said on the stand.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nWhat the scene is like inside the courtroom as Trump takes the stand\n\nIt was an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump took the witness stand a bit ago in New York. The former president slowly climbed a couple of steps into the box and raised his hand to take the oath.\n\nFormer presidents are typically surrounded by a force-field of deference, due to their status and are accompanied everywhere by Secret Service agents.\n\nBut Trump, in a blue suit, shirt and blue tie rather than his typical campaign uniform of white shirt and red tie, is sitting in the witness box alone in a leather chair, with wood panels on either side. His hands are clasped in his lap, and a large bottle of water and two smaller ones are to his left beside a screen allowing him to see court documents.\n\nThis is a civil trial rather than a criminal one. And the American people can’t see it because it’s not televised. But this the moment when the reality of the 2024 campaign hit home. Trump is simultaneously a multiple defendant, as well as being the Republican front-runner and potential next US president.\n\nThis is the most extraordinary campaign in modern history in microcosm.\n\nTrump says he would on occasion make suggestions on financial docs at heart of the trial\n\nFurther questioning in today’s civil fraud trial turned toward the financial documents at the heart of the trial, with Donald Trump saying he would look at financial statements, and on occasion make suggestions.\n\nTrump says of his statements of financial condition, “I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions.”\n\nThe former president says that bankers didn’t pay much attention to his financial statements, and says that is going to be part of their defense.\n\n“We’ll explain that as this trial goes along. This crazy trial goes along. Because we’re bringing in the bankers. Very big bankers,” Trump says. “They will explain exactly what their process is.”\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to. They looked at the deal,” he testified.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump arrives to court ahead of testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has arrived at a New York courthouse to face questions in the $250 million civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nJudge overseeing Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order on Friday\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order in the trial to extend to Trump’s attorneys after they raised multiple questions about the judge’s communications with his law clerk.\n\nIn a written order Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron prohibited Trump’s attorneys from making any further comments about confidential communications between the judge and his staff inside or outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe judge said violating the order would result in “serious sanctions.”\n\nAnalysis: Trump heads to the witness stand as the latest polls show him leaping past Biden in key swing states\n\nA year away from Election Day 2024, former President Donald Trump is set to testify in a civil fraud trial and separately faces more than 90 criminal charges, setting up the possibility that a convicted felon tops the Republican ticket next November.\n\nBut it’s President Joe Biden’s political prospects that are plunging.\n\nIn another extraordinary twist to a 2024 campaign season that is more notable for court hearings than treks through early voting states, Trump is expected to be called to the witness stand in New York on Monday. This is hardly typical activity during a post-presidency. But Trump was, after all, the most unconventional president.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is absorbing brutal new polls showing him losing to GOP front-runner Trump in multiple key swing states. The numbers will likely ignite panic among Democrats and renew doubts among Americans that the soon-to-be-81-year-old is up to a full second term. If the New York Times/Siena College survey is borne out in 2024, there would be no electoral path to victory for Biden. And an increasingly authoritarian Trump – who is promising a second term of “retribution” – could pull off a White House comeback in spite of sparking a Capitol insurrection with his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020.\n\n“I was concerned before these polls, and I’m concerned now,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“These presidential races over the last couple of terms have been very tight. No one is going to have a runaway election here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, concentration, resources. And so we have our work cut out for us.”\n\nThe coinciding crises facing both Trump and Biden belie the fact that, for all their deficiencies, neither is yet to face a serious challenger from within their parties as they seek the nomination.\n\nBiden’s position is weakening as he tackles cascading global threats such as the war in the Middle East, sheds support over his handling of the economy and sees cracks in the multiracial coalition that first elected him. It also reflects a nation that is divided and disconsolate, and groping for the elusive normality that the president promised three years ago after the pandemic and the historic turbulence of the Trump administration.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nHas a former president ever given testimony in his own civil trial?\n\nWhen Donald Trump takes the stand in his New York civil fraud trial Monday, it won’t be the first time a former president will have given testimony in his own defense in a lawsuit.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did it twice more than a hundred years ago, both when he sued a Michigan newspaper that accused him of being a drunk and later when he was sued by a fellow New York Republican whom Roosevelt had called a corrupt political boss.\n\nRoosevelt won both cases. Trump, by contrast, has already been found liable for fraud by the judge in New York.\n\nThose Roosevelt trials, separated by two years, were each sensational at the time, and they came after Roosevelt’s final campaign for the White House, when he placed second to Democrat Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after splitting with Republicans and running as a Progressive.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is very much still in the arena, and his legal strategy in a slew of civil and criminal cases is tied to his concurrent presidential campaign. He has argued that two gag orders – the one issued against him by a federal judge in Washington, DC, and the other by the civil trial judge in New York – hinder his ability to speak as a candidate.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-testifies-new-york-fraud-trial/', 'Headline': 'Trump clashes with judge, defends business record in testimony at New ...', 'Snippet': ""Trump's testimony Former President Donald Trump waits to take the witness stand at New York Supreme Court on Monday, Nov. 6, 2023. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / AP"", 'Full_text': 'Testifying under oath in a New York courtroom with the fate of his family\'s business empire on the line, former President Donald Trump lashed out against the judicial forces that put him there.\n\nTrump has already been found liable for fraud, a word he lobbed at the judge overseeing the civil trial against him. He said New York Attorney General Letitia James ""should be ashamed of herself.""\n\nOver the course of four hours on the stand on Monday, Trump repeatedly strayed from the questions, earning reprimands from New York Judge Arthur Engoron on several occasions. The judge, who was seated just feet away from Trump, will decide the outcome of the bench trial himself.\n\nThe case stems from a $250 million civil lawsuit filed by James\' office, which accused Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives of a yearslong fraud scheme. The state alleges the defendants inflated the value of the company\'s assets and Trump\'s personal wealth to obtain better terms on loans and insurance. The attorney general is seeking to recoup $250 million and limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York. The defendants have all denied wrongdoing, and Trump has repeatedly accused James of pursuing him for political reasons.\n\nIn his testimony, the former president and current front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination stood by the valuations of various Trump properties that other co-defendants have sought to distance themselves from.\n\n""The numbers of my net worth are substantially more than the numbers reflected on the financial statements,"" he said in one exchange. ""Therefore you have no case.""\n\nTrump\'s testimony\n\nTrump arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan shortly before 10 a.m. and made brief remarks, reiterating his criticism of the trial.\n\n""It\'s a terrible, terrible thing. These are political operatives that I\'m going to be dealing with right now,"" Trump said. ""It\'s a very sad situation for our country.""\n\nOutside the courtroom, James predicted Trump would ""engage in name-calling, taunts and race-baiting,"" but said, ""At the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friend, don\'t lie.""\n\nTrump then took the stand. Kevin Wallace, a lawyer from the attorney general\'s office, kicked off the questioning by asking Trump about a trust he established to manage his assets before he entered the White House. When he left office in 2021, he took control of the trust, only to relinquish it again in July 2021. He testified that he did so because of increasing legal pressure from a number of fronts.\n\n""You and about every other Democrat district attorney, A.G., and U.S. attorney were coming at me from 15 different sides, all Democrats, Trump haters,"" Trump said, adding that he had ""great confidence"" in his son to manage his assets.\n\nTrump repeatedly gave long-winded answers to questions about the valuations of various Trump Organization properties, and Engoron\'s patience soon wore thin. Christopher Kise, one of Trump\'s attorneys, encouraged Engoron to allow Trump to give answers in his own way.\n\n""With this witness I would suggest it\'s far more efficient to listen to what he has to say and take it in,"" Kise said, prompting laughter from Wallace.\n\nEngoron\'s voice rose as his anger seemed to boil over, and his microphone struggled to handle the sudden change in volume.\n\n""No, I\'m not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron said, his voice rising. ""I\'m here to hear him answer questions. Sit down!""\n\nEngoron said he was considering drawing negative conclusions from Trump\'s testimony.\n\n""We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can\'t, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can,"" Engoron said.\n\nAfter a break, Wallace posed questions about the valuations of Trump\'s and his company\'s properties, including Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower in Manhattan and an upstate New York estate known as Seven Springs. Trump defended the financial statements listing their supposed value, saying that even those valuations that have been determined to be inflated were too low. He added that he would not be willing to sell several properties because they were worth so much.\n\nJames\' office says the documents, known as statements of financial condition, inflated his net worth by billions. Trump said the documents included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies.\n\n""The disclaimer clause says if there\'s a mistake, if there\'s something, don\'t rely on it,"" Trump said. ""[The disclaimers] always hold up in court, except maybe this court.""\n\nTrump also insisted that increases in property values over time justified overvaluations in the past, an argument Engoron has previously rejected. Discussing property valuations for 2014, Trump said, ""If you carry that forward to 2021, all of those valuations were low.""\n\nTrump became particularly animated during discussion of Mar-a-Lago, the Florida club where he resides for most of the year. Engoron\'s pretrial ruling finding Trump liable for fraud noted that the local assessor valued Mar-a-Lago at $18 million, while in documents Trump valued it at hundreds of millions more. The former president said in his testimony that he believes it\'s worth as much as $1.5 billion.\n\nThe property is ""deed-restricted"" and cannot be used as a residence, which experts previously told CBS News limits its value. Trump said he agreed to the deed restriction for tax purposes, acknowledging that the lower assessed value limits the property\'s tax burden. He then described a hypothetical scheme in which a person calls their own home a club to save money on taxes.\n\n""There are a lot of advantages to the club status, the smartest thing to do would be to have a club and have one member,"" Trump said.\n\nHe later argued about whether it was accurate to value one of his Scottish golf clubs as if he has built nearly 2,500 new homes on it, when in fact he has built none and is limited by contract to just under 1,500.\n\n""At some point maybe in my very old age I\'ll go there and do the most beautiful thing you\'ve ever seen,"" the 77-year-old said.\n\nLater in the day, Trump described a loan related to Chicago property as having been ""long since gone."" Pressed on that detail, he conceded it was actually paid off ""very recently.""\n\nWallace then asked, ""Are you aware that the Trump Chicago loan was paid off last week?""\n\nTrump said he was, and that, ""my son recommended it,"" referring to Eric Trump, who testified about that and other properties on Nov. 2 and 3.\n\nTrump said his company has begun looking into whether it needs to change internal policies as a result of the state\'s investigation.\n\n""There will be recommendations made, and we will perhaps let you know what those recommendations are, it wouldn\'t bother me to let you know about it. But we have asked,"" Trump said, adding that Eric Trump has been in charge of communicating with accountants and lawyers about that process.\n\nHe was excused from the witness stand shortly before 3:30 p.m., with the defense team declining to pose questions.\n\nThe fraud trial\n\nTrump is accused in the civil suit of being the primary beneficiary of a scheme to fraudulently portray his wealth as far greater than it is, and his properties as far more valuable, in order to get undeservedly favorable loan and insurance terms. The judge in the case has already found Trump, his two adult sons and their company liable for fraud, determining that the scheme led to hundreds of millions in unearned profits.\n\nThe trial is focused on other allegations, including falsification of business records, conspiracy and insurance fraud, as well as disgorgement — the exact amount of ""ill-gotten gains"" the Trumps must pay the state.\n\nTrump and his company have for more than a year blamed their former outside accountants, Mazars USA, for any inaccuracies in their statements of financial condition, essentially a snapshot of Trump\'s wealth. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump reiterated that defense in testimony last week, saying they ""trusted"" internal and external accounting teams.\n\nBut their former Mazars accountant testified in October that his firm merely compiled reams of financial information provided to them by the Trumps and their company.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking $250 million and sanctions designed to limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York, including permanently barring Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director in any business in the state.\n\nReporting contributed by Katrina Kaufman.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/us/key-moments-trumps-testimony-new-york-fraud-trial-2023-11-06/', 'Headline': ""Key moments from Trump's testimony at New York fraud trial"", 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump testified for roughly four hours on Monday at his civil fraud trial in New York, as the former U.S. president used the witness stand to boast about his wealth and lash out at the ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/11/08/1211487348/ivanka-trump-testimony-fraud-trial', 'Headline': ""Ivanka Trump testifies in Donald Trump's New York civil fraud trial - NPR"", 'Snippet': 'She is the last Trump family member expected to be called to the witness stand by the New York state attorney general. Former President Donald Trump and his two oldest sons already testified.', 'Full_text': 'Ivanka Trump\'s testimony before a New York judge Wednesday offered a glimpse into the strategy former President Donald Trump\'s legal team could deploy as they begin their defense in the case.\n\nJesus Suarez, one of the attorneys in the Trump legal team, conducted her cross-examination, making her the only Trump family member who was questioned by the defense.\n\nSuarez asked Ivanka Trump if she was personally responsible for submitting, preparing, reviewing or approving the financial statements. To all, Trump answered no.\n\nBut Suarez also asked her about what interactions Trump Organization executives may have had with members of Deutsche Bank, one of the financial institutions that received financial statements from the Trump Organization that have already been ruled fraudulent.\n\n""They were very happy,"" she said, of the bank\'s reactions to finished projects.\n\nShe also said they thought the Old Post Office in Washington, which for a time was the Trump International Hotel, was the ""crown jewel"" of their investment portfolio.\n\nThe pattern of questioning by the defense — which sought to establish the fact that no financial institution or anyone else suffered because of the Trump Organization\'s deals — could be how the defense makes the case that not only did Trump\'s actions harm no one, banks benefited from them.\n\nThe former president has often argued that he has done nothing wrong, adding that banks and buyers he dealt with were happy with the negotiations and final results. He argued it\'s not a crime because there is no victim. But under New York law, lying isn\'t allowed in business, even if no one was harmed.\n\nIndeed, the state attorney general\'s lawsuit argues that the manipulating of numbers to inflate or deflate net worth for financial gain is a crime.\n\nTrump, the elder daughter of the former president, is not a defendant in the case. She was called to the witness stand to answer questions regarding fraudulent financial documents filed by the Trump Organization.\n\n""She clearly was involved in negotiating and securing loans, favorable loans, for the benefit of the Trump Organization, for Mr. Trump, for her brothers and for herself,"" said state Attorney General Letitia James outside the courtroom. ""At the end of the day, this case is about fraudulent statements of financial condition that she benefited from.""\n\nIvanka Trump is expected to be the last witness called by the state attorney general\'s legal team in the civil fraud trial that will determine the penalties faced by other members of the Trump family.\n\nShe had been the executive vice president of development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization. During questioning led by AG lawyer Louis Solomon, Trump was asked about her knowledge of her father\'s statements of financial conditions.\n\n""Not that I am aware of,"" she said.\n\nTrump was also asked by the attorney general team about her involvement in executing the purchase of the Trump National Doral property in Miami. The attorney general\'s lawsuit alleges that Donald Trump\'s inflated statements were used to secure a $125 million loan from Deutsche Bank and were regularly submitted to the bank to fulfill Donald Trump\'s financial reporting requirements as guarantor on the loan.\n\nShe testified that she didn\'t recall if the bank asked for the statements or if she offered them.\n\nThe former president has been accused by James of being a part of a scheme that involved inflating or deflating the value of assets in order to secure better business, insurance and banking deals between 2011 and 2021. Trump\'s two older sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, are also defendants in the lawsuit. Judge Arthur Engoron has already ruled that Trump is liable of fraud.\n\nSeveral months ago, Ivanka Trump\'s attorney successfully argued that any related actions Ivanka had at the Trump Organization happened before the statute of limitations kicked in.\n\nOutside the courtroom, James argued that Ivanka Trump personally benefited from the inflated financial statements, even as she stepped away from the Trump Organization.\n\nDonald Trump\'s legal team is expected to begin their defense next week, with the goal of being done by mid-December.\n\nIvanka Trump is the last in her family to testify\n\nEarlier this week, Engoron heard testimony from the former president himself.\n\nTrump argued he was responsible for providing information to the accounting firm Mazars, which compiled the statements. While answering questions, Trump took jabs at Engoron, James and the trial. He took long tangents when answering questions, which annoyed Engoron, called James a ""political hack,"" and said he thought the trial was unfair.\n\nThroughout his testimony Monday, Trump argued that even the financial statements were conservative estimates of the value of his properties and that he relied on others to compile the statements. Still, he did acknowledge that he had a hand in reviewing some of the final numbers in the valuations.\n\nEric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are both executive vice presidents of the Trump Organization and held key leadership roles during the time their father was president.\n\nEric Trump at first denied having ""anything to do"" with the statements of financial condition. But the court was shown email correspondence between Trump and then-controller of the Trump Organization Jeffrey McConney (now co-defendant), in which Trump was asked to review and provide input on the statements and properties in the statements. Trump told the court he relied on others to ensure the statements were accurate, even if the court documents show he was privy to the process.\n\nHis brother Trump Jr. had a similar testimony. When asked directly by Engoron if he had anything to do with statements of financial condition issued by the Trump Organization, Trump Jr. said no, although he was responsible for the statements, according to documents shown in the trial.\n\nThroughout his testimony, Trump Jr. said also he relied on others, such as co-defendant and former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Wesselberg, to vet the statements of financial condition.\n\nMcConney and Weisselberg have also already testified.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.courthousenews.com/final-witness-delivers-blistering-testimony-against-trump-in-civil-fraud-case/', 'Headline': 'Final witness delivers blistering testimony against Trump in civil ...', 'Snippet': 'MANHATTAN (CN) — After more than ten weeks, testimony in Donald Trump’s civil fraud case finally concluded on Wednesday with a rebuttal witness that prompted a venomous clash between defense and state attorneys.

The poll numbers were also referred to in court today by Trump\'s attorney.\n\n""When you look at the numbers, the poll numbers that came out today ... people are sick and tired of what\'s happening,"" Trump said when he left the courtroom.\n\nJames says Trump \'engaged in distractions\' in court today\n\nLeaving the courtroom today, James characterized Trump\'s testimony as a series of ""distractions"" and ""insults.""\n\n""Today we heard from Donald Trump,"" James said.

""We have a very hostile judge. I don’t have a jury. I wanted a jury.""\n\nThe mood in court has changed\n\nWhile the post-break mood in court is more relaxed, and Trump seems to be answering questions somewhat concisely, there have been some testy moments.\n\nAt one point, Trump cut the attorney general\'s lawyer off, telling him ""no"" and continuing to speak as the lawyer tried to ask a question.\n\nAt another point, when Trump continued to assert that his net worth was greater than what was on financial statements and thus the state didn\'t have a case, he again mentioned a disclaimer clause the company put on its financial statements, saying it ""goes on forever.""\n\n“That clause isn’t the only thing that goes on forever,” AG\'s office lawyer Kevin Wallace replied, apparently referring to Trump\'s previously discursive answers to his questions.\n\nTrump is calmer after the break\n\nTrump appears more measured and steady in answering the attorney general lawyer\'s questions — in sharp contrast to his testimony before lunch, when he was fired up.\n\nAG James mocks Trump\'s testimony\n\nand\n\nLetitia James, who\'s in attendance in court today, took to the social media platform X to deride one of Trump\'s claims about her on the witness stand.\n\nTrump testified that the value of his property at 40 Wall Street ""is hundreds of millions of dollars more than what she says. She doesn’t even know what 40 Wall Street is.""\n\nJames laughed at the remark in court, and then posted a message with a shushing emoji that said, ""Don’t tell, I can see it from my office window.""\n\nThe court has returned from the lunch break\n\nand\n\nThe court is back in session after a lunch break. The judge returned to the courtroom at about 2:15 p.m. ET.\n\nTrump is now back on the stand to resume his testimony.\n\nSketch: Trump on the stand\n\nA courtroom sketch artist\'s rendering of Trump testifying at his civil fraud trial today.\n\nTrump\'s lawyer calls Engoron \'unhinged\'\n\nAlina Habba, one of Trump\'s attorneys, told reporters during the lunch break that Engoron is ""unhinged"" and had ""predetermined"" that Trump was guilty.\n\n""I don\'t want to hear what he has to say,"" Habba said, quoting the judge\'s admonishment to Trump\'s lawyers this morning after Engoron asked Trump to give more succinct answers during his testimony.\n\n""That was what rang true loud and could not have been more honest, coming from the judge who was already predetermined that my client committed fraud before we even walked into this courtroom,"" Habba said.\n\nWhen he made the remark, Engoron had been trying to rein in Trump’s answers, telling his team that the former president was not there to talk about things outside the attorney general’s lawyer’s line of questioning.\n\nHabba went on to say that the country is ""falling apart"" and there is ""corruption in courtrooms where attorneys are gagged.""\n\n""You have a right to hire a lawyer who can stand up and say something when they see something wrong. But I was told to sit down today, I was yelled at,"" Habba said.\n\nHabba also criticized James, saying that she was using the trial to ""make a name for herself.""\n\n""[James] said this morning that the numbers don\'t lie and they won\'t lie in this case. Well, Miss James, I have a message for you: The numbers didn\'t lie when you ran for governor, and that\'s why you dropped out,"" Habba said.\n\nDuring the break, Trump also quoted Engoron\'s remark without context in a post on his social media site Truth Social.\n\nAt least one other former president has testified in court\n\nAt least one other former president has testified in court after having left office — Teddy Roosevelt did so twice.\n\nIn 1913, the 26th president was a plaintiff in a civil suit against a Michigan newspaper that had accused him of being a drunk. The second was a civil case in which Roosevelt was sued by a New York Republican Party boss he’d accused of being corrupt. Roosevelt won both cases.\n\nNBC News legal analyst Chuck Rosenberg breaks down Trump’s possible motives for sparring with Engoron while testifying in his civil fraud trial.\n\nThe court has left for a lunch break\n\nand\n\nThe court adjourned at about 12:50 p.m. ET for lunch. The proceedings are expected to resume again at 2:15 p.m. ET.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom with a team of aides and his lawyers, quickly passing reporters in the hallway again with no comment, but flashing a thumbs-up.\n\nJames also passed by reporters in the hallway but did not comment.\n\nTrump interrupts questioning to read from a document he pulled from his pocket\n\nMinutes ago, Trump pulled a paper out of his pocket, saying he wanted to read it. But the attorney general\'s lawyer pivoted to another question, and Trump rested the document to his right on the witness stand.\n\nTrump then interrupted the lawyer, saying he just wanted to read the document, and turned to the judge for an answer.\n\nEngoron told him no.\n\n“I am shocked,” Trump said.\n\nIt\'s unclear what the document is.\n\nTrump trains his ire on Engoron\n\nand\n\nLosing his composure, Trump then focused his ire on the judge, saying Engoron ruled against him before knowing anything about his company.\n\nTrump said the judge called him a ""fraud,"" raising his voice and pointing his right hand at the judge while looking straight ahead at the courtroom. He then said any fraud was on the part of the judge for his comments on the value of Trump\'s properties, not on Trump, calling it ""a terrible thing.""\n\nEngoron just looked forward, sour-faced.\n\n""Done?"" Wallace asked when Trump ended his outburst.\n\n“Done,” the former president said.\n\nTrump has essentially brought his rants inside the courtroom. Before, he would be well mannered during his appearances here; it was outside where he lost his cool. Now he\'s losing it on the witness stand.\n\nTrump defiantly asserts his wealth, calls James a \'hack\'\n\nand\n\nAs Trump was asked questions about additional properties, the former president said he is worth billions of dollars more than Attorney General Letitia James has said.\n\nPeople don\'t recognize the strength of the company he built because James\' office is trying to ""demean"" and ""hurt"" him, Trump claimed.\n\n“I think she is a political hack,” he said about the attorney general.\n\nHe repeated a common refrain of his online, calling the trial a political witch hunt and saying James should be ashamed of herself.\n\nWhile testifying in his New York civil fraud trial, Trump sparred with Engoron about his business dealings and claimed the trial was politically motivated. NBC News’ Vaughn Hillyard reports on what Trump said under oath so far.\n\nTrump appears restless during testimony\n\nand\n\nAs he testifies, Trump is leaning way back in his chair and has his arms crossed on his chest. He also appears a bit restless, slightly swaying his body back and forth.\n\nEarlier in the testimony, when Wallace would ask him to refer to pages of documents before him, Trump would only look at a screen provided in the courthouse, unlike a typical witness who would refer to the pages in his or her hands.\n\nTrump says he thought several valuations were \'too high\'\n\nand\n\nAs questioning continued about Trump\'s properties, the former president said he thought several valuations were ""too high,"" including of his Trump Tower triplex in 2014.\n\nAsked why the valuation was too high, Trump said a broker assessed the total area as 30,000 square feet, ""and I have access to the roof, and when you add the roof, you’re not that far off.” He said, ""I see how it was done,"" telling the court that ""they took 10,000 per floor"" and ""times three"" and didn’t take out the elevator shaft and other things.\n\nHe added, “There\'s a disclaimer clause, so if there is a mistake ... you don\'t get sued by the attorney general\'s office.”\n\nIn his earlier deposition, Trump referred to a disclaimer clause in the company\'s financial statements ""that says, don’t believe the statement, go out and do your own work. This statement is \'worthless.\' It means nothing.""\n\nBut in his late-September ruling ahead of the trial, Engoron shot down Trump’s claim. “The clause does not use the words ‘worthless’ or ‘useless’ or ‘ignore’ or any similar words,” Engoron wrote. “It does not say ‘the values herein are what I think the properties will be worth in ten or more years.’”\n\nEngoron cuts off Trump and prosecutor repeats questions\n\nand\n\nShortly after Trump resumed testimony, Engoron cut off the former president after Trump started to go on after answering a question about the value of an Avenue of the Americas property.\n\nAt another point, Trump veered into his focusing on China, Russia, and keeping the U.S. safe while president, the attorney general\'s lawyer said, “The question was actually about this property value.”\n\n""The question was"" and ""let me ask again"" are becoming familiar refrains as Trump doesn\'t answer the questions.\n\nTrump has returned to the courtroom\n\nand\n\nTrump walked back into the courtroom at about 11:14 a.m. ET.\n\nHe turned to reporters in the hallway and gave a silent thumbs-up before following his lawyers through the courtroom doors.\n\nThe judge also entered the courtroom and everyone stood.\n\nWhen he resumed testimony, Trump began answering questions more succinctly.\n\nTrump leaves for a break without addressing reporters\n\nTrump exited the courtroom for a 15-minute break, walking quickly past reporters in the hallway.\n\nWhen asked, ""How\'s it going in there?"" Trump gestured as if zipping his lips and continued to walk away with his lawyers.\n\nBreak called; Trump leaves stand\n\nThe court is taking a break. Trump has left the witness stand.\n\nJudge tells Trump lawyers: \'I beseech you to control him\'\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nThe judge is again asking Trump\'s lawyers to have him answer questions directly while on the stand.\n\n""That was a simple yes-no answer,"" the judge said. ""I beseech you to control him.""\n\nThe judge went back and forth with Kise, with the judge saying, ""I don\'t want to hear everything he has to say.""\n\nHabba then told the judge that Wallace needs to ask better questions, saying, ""More succinct questions will give more succinct answers.""\n\n""We are not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron responded. ""We are here to have him answer questions.""\n\n""It\'s not that simple,"" Habba replied.\n\n""I am not here to hear what he has to say, now sit down!"" Engoron then said, raising his voice.\n\nThe testy exchange prompted Trump to comment, ""This is a very unfair trial. I hope the public is watching.""\n\nThe judge\'s warnings are critical, as the case here is only meant to determine monetary damages. If Engoron determines that all of Trump\'s testimony is not credible, as he did the last time Trump took the stand, he may impose significant financial damages on Trump and his company.\n\nAttorney in hush money case audibly laughs\n\nand\n\nAs Trump continued to testify, one of his attorneys in the separate hush money case being brought by the Manhattan district attorney could be heard laughing in the second row of the courtroom as she observed and took notes.\n\nTrump says he thought Mar-a-Lago\'s value was underestimated\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nWhen asked about Mar-a-Lago, Trump said he thought its value was underestimated, but added that he didn\'t do anything about it.\n\nTrump referred to the attorney general\'s estimation that the Florida property was worth far less than he claimed (the AG’s office had noted the Palm Beach County assessor appraised its market value to be $18 million to $28 million from 2011 to 2021, while Trump’s balance sheet put its value at $426 million to $612 million).\n\nTrump claimed on the stand that the property was 50 to 100 times the state\'s estimation. He said he doesn\'t know how the lower estimation was arrived at, calling it ""absolutely crazy.""\n\nTrump says he thought his apartment was \'overvalued\'\n\nand\n\nTrump testified that he thought his Manhattan apartment ""was overvalued when I looked at it.""\n\n""But you never know because people come along and could say it\'s worth $250 million. It only takes one person to buy it,"" he said. ""I thought it was high and it is the brand value.""\n\n""The brand value is a very big part of the asset value of the company,"" he added. ""I could have added brand value and increased the value, and my financial statement would be very substantial.""\n\nEngoron asks Trump lawyers to control him\n\nJudge Engoron asked Trump\'s attorneys if they could control him in the courtroom. He said, ""This is not a political rally … maybe you need to have a talk with him right now.""\n\nKise calls Trump the \'future\' U.S. president, citing New York Times/Siena poll\n\nand\n\nDuring questioning, Trump attorney Chris Kise referred to his client as the future president of the United States, citing a poll released yesterday by The New York Times.\n\nThe survey, conducted in conjunction with Siena College, found that Trump is leading Biden in five out of six battleground states.\n\nTrump distances himself from his financial statements\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nAsked about the exaggerated financial statements at the heart of the case, Trump said that he knew little about them, and that banks didn\'t care about them.\n\n“All I did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary to supply the accountants for the statements,"" he said. ""I authorized whatever they needed to do to get their statement done.”\n\nAs for the bankers that the AG maintains were duped into giving him more favorable loans than he was entitled to, Trump said, ""They paid little attention to documents. They were more interested in the deal.”\n\nTrump says judge will rule against him\n\nand\n\n“What did you do to meet your responsibility of preparation of the financial statement,” James’ office asked.\n\nTrump said: “Me personally? First of all this was so long ago this is past statute of limitations.”\n\nTrump then insisted that Engoron will “rule against me because he will always rule against me.”\n\nEngoron pushed back, saying that Trump’s claim isn’t true, and asked him to please answer the question again: “You can attack me all you want, but just answer the question.”\n\nJudge tells Trump to be more \'responsive\'\n\nAt one point as Trump started to testify, Engoron asked him to ""please move it along and answer the questions.""\n\n""Some of the questions haven\'t been responsive,"" the judge added.\n\nTrump looked ahead as the judge said this, never turning toward him.\n\nTrump claims bankers didn’t pay attention to the financial statements\n\nand\n\nTrump said his team will bring in bankers who ""paid little attention"" to financial documents.\n\n“This crazy trial goes along. We will bring in bankers. They will explain what the process is,"" he said. ""They paid little attention to documents. They were more interested in the deal.”\n\nTrump rails against AG and prosecutors, calling them \'all haters\'\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nKevin Wallace, a lawyer for the AG\'s office, asked Trump about the appointment and acceptance of trustees, and in response, he said, ""You and every other Democrat … coming after me from 15 different sides … all haters.""\n\nHe was referring to the New York attorney general and U.S. attorneys.\n\nTrump has been sworn in\n\nTrump has been sworn in inside the courtroom, kicking off his testimony.\n\nTrump has taken the stand\n\nThe former president is now in the witness stand, where he will be questioned by prosecutors.\n\nTrump and Engoron enter courtroom\n\nand\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom and is seated at the defense table with his hands clasped together.\n\nHe\'s been chatting with his lawyers, Chris Kise and Alina Habba.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron has entered the courtroom.\n\nIt will be a tale of two Donalds on Monday: The one inside court, who has generally maintained his composure aside from a few facial expressions and a waving of the arms, and the one outside, who goes off on Engoron and his law clerk and a legal system that he claims is arrayed against him and his family.\n\nJames arrives at courthouse, says numbers \'don\'t lie\'\n\nJames arrived at the courthouse and told reporters outside that the facts and the numbers don\'t lie.\n\n""Trump has repeatedly and consistently misrepresented the value of his assets,"" she said. ""I’m certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting and call this a witch hunt. But at the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friends, don’t lie.""\n\nOnce inside, James greeted the prosecutors in a show of support, shaking hands with the visitors sitting in the front row.\n\nWhat to expect from Trump\'s testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is set to take the witness stand in a New York courtroom Monday, testifying in a high-stakes civil case that could lead to the dismantling of his sprawling business empire.\n\nHe was deposed in April after James filed her bombshell suit alleging that he and his company inflated their assets to the tune of billions of dollars to get more favorable rates from banks and insurers, and his answers there are likely to be a guidepost about how he’ll be questioned Monday.\n\nTrump spent about seven hours in the deposition answering questions from the attorney general’s office and disavowing responsibility for the annual statements of financial condition, which say “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.”\n\nIn his deposition, Trump testified that he considered the financial statements as being “worthless” and not “important” because they contained a clause that said, “the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon the disposition of the assets or payment of the related liabilities.”\n\nIn his deposition, Trump referred to that as a “clause in there that says, don’t believe the statement, go and do your own work. The statement is worthless. It means nothing.”\n\nIn his Oct. 2 ruling, Engoron shot down Trump’s claim. “The clause does not use the words ‘worthless’ or ‘useless’ or ‘ignore’ or any similar words,” Engoron wrote. “It does not say ‘the values herein are what I think the properties will be worth in ten or more years.’”\n\nRead the full story here\n\nThe courtroom is at full capacity ahead of Trump\'s testimony\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nThe courtroom has reached full capacity in anticipation of Trump\'s testimony today.\n\nThe line to get into the courtroom is still long and the number of photographers in the hallway is the highest it has been since the beginning of the trial. Some friends of the judge and his clerk are seated in the front row excited to witness history.\n\nEngoron has expanded a gag order to include members of the former president\'s legal team. The order was issued after the judge claimed they made “inappropriate remarks” about his law clerk.\n\nAnti-Trump protesters are outside the courthouse\n\nand\n\nA group of anti-Trump protesters gathered outside the courthouse this morning, holding a banner that reads, ""Invoke the 14th.""\n\nThe protesters advocating for invoking the 14th Amendment against Trump to block him from the ballot in his 2024 presidential run briefly stopped traffic along Centre Street. Police moved them across the street into Foley Square and traffic has since resumed.\n\nTrump leaves for the courthouse\n\nTrump\'s motorcade has departed from Trump Tower and is en route to the courthouse.\n\nTrump lashes out at Engoron and James ahead of testimony\n\nAhead of his highly anticipated testimony today, Trump took aim at Engoron and James in a post on Truth Social this morning, despite Engoron\'s gag order barring the former president and his lawyers from discussing the judge’s staff.\n\nIn his post, Trump denied wrongdoing as he repeated his claims that the trial is a political hit job against him orchestrated by Engoron and James.\n\n""Got a really Biased, Nasty, Club controlled, but often overturned, Judge, a Racist, Evil, and Corrupt Attorney General, BUT A CASE THAT, ACCORDING TO ALMOST ALL LEGAL SCHOLARS, HAS ZERO MERIT,"" he wrote. ""A dark day for our Country. WITCH HUNT!”\n\nTrump testified in the trial briefly — and then stormed out of court\n\nTrump stormed out of a New York City courtroom Oct. 25 after a heated day in court in which the former president was called to the witness stand in his $250 million state fraud case and fined $10,000 for violating a gag order.\n\nTrump’s abrupt departure appeared to surprise even his own lawyers and his Secret Service agents, who went scurrying after him. He returned to the courtroom in Manhattan after the court day ended and after Cohen finished his contentious testimony.\n\nEngoron handed down the financial penalty after having called Trump to testify under oath in the afternoon about whom he was talking about when he told reporters earlier in the day that the person sitting next to the judge was “very partisan.”\n\nTrump said he was referring to Cohen, whom he has called a rat, a liar and a felon. Engoron said he found Trump’s brief testimony “not credible.” He fined Trump for violating the gag order he issued this month after Trump had smeared his law clerk on social media.\n\nA red-faced and angry-looking Trump stormed out of the courtroom about 45 minutes later after Engoron denied a motion from his lawyers on a separate legal issue.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nHighlights from Eric Trump and Don Jr.\'s testimony last week\n\nDuring his testimony last week, Eric largely asserted that he lacked knowledge of the details of Trump Organization property appraisals and financial statements. The former president’s second-oldest son described himself as a “construction guy,” saying, “I pour concrete. I operate properties. I don’t focus on appraisals.”\n\nAt one point, however, he did acknowledge an awareness of his father’s financial statements dating as far back as 2013.\n\nTrump\'s eldest son, Don Jr., the first of the two to take the stand, said during his testimony that he didn’t recall the details of several documents shown to him in court. He added that he relied on the Trump Organization’s accountants and accounting firm, Mazars USA.\n\nTrump attorney Chris Kise, meanwhile, continued Friday to complain about the judge, pointing to stories in right-wing news outlets alleging Engoron and his clerk have made political donations to Democrats. Kise pointed to a story that alleged the clerk made donations in excess of legal limits for court staff in violation of court rules, and that the judge was notified and did nothing about it, which Kise said could be grounds for a mistrial if true.\n\nEngoron called the allegations untrue, adding, ""It\'s a shame we have descended to this level.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/06/nyregion/trump-fraud-trial', 'Headline': ""Highlights From Trump's Testimony in NY Fraud Trial - The New York Times"", 'Snippet': 'Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times. On the first day of Donald J. Trump’s testimony in Manhattan, the judge presiding over the civil fraud case against the former president tried to do what ...', 'Full_text': ""Ranting and rambling as the courtroom pulsed with tension, Mr. Trump attacked New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, as a “political hack.” He derided the proceeding as “a very unfair trial.” And he scolded the judge overseeing the case, Arthur F. Engoron, for having decided before the trial that he had committed fraud.\n\n“He called me a fraud, and he didn’t know anything about me!” Mr. Trump exclaimed from the stand, pointing at the judge, who flashed a grin.\n\nThe outbursts demonstrated the former president’s disdain for a case that has already imperiled his family business and labeled him a fraud and a cheat. Ms. James, who has become one of Mr. Trump’s arch antagonists, has not only put his company on trial, but also called into question the richer-than-rich persona that he built over his years as a businessman and reality television star — the identity that propelled his run for the White House.\n\nMr. Trump, who was accused by Ms. James of inflating his net worth to defraud banks and insurers, acknowledged helping to assemble annual financial statements submitted to the banks.\n\n“I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions,” said Mr. Trump, who began the day looking tired but soon grew animated.\n\nAlthough the admission appeared to bolster the attorney general’s case, Mr. Trump, seated 30 feet from Ms. James, also sought to minimize the import of the financial statements, which he said he largely left to aides. He noted that they contained numerous disclaimers, making them essentially “worthless.” Banks paid little attention to them, he said, before promising, unprompted, that some of his bankers would soon testify in his defense.\n\nMr. Trump, the leading Republican contender for the presidency, brought combative campaign-trail energy to the courtroom, punctuating his testimony with grandiose claims and long-winded asides that infuriated the judge and obscured some of his more effective testimony.\n\nHe delivered an impassioned ode to his golf course near Aberdeen, Scotland, calling it an “artistic expression” and the greatest ever built. He assailed Justice Engoron: “The fraud is on the court, not me.”\n\nThe judge, who will determine the outcome of the case instead of a jury, repeatedly admonished Mr. Trump for not directly responding to questions from Ms. James’s team.\n\n“You can attack me. You can do whatever you want,” Justice Engoron told him, “but answer the question.”\n\nWhen the judge turned to Mr. Trump with a simple request — “please no speeches” — his words drew a smirk from the former president, who continued to meander. At one point, Mr. Trump interrupted Kevin Wallace, a state lawyer questioning him, with an “Excuse me, sir,” so that he could opine about what he would have done had he in fact wanted to inflate the value of his assets.\n\n“The net worth of me was far greater than the financial statements,” Mr. Trump scolded Mr. Wallace, later telling him that he should be “ashamed.”\n\n“People like you go around and try to demean me and try to hurt me,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Wallace.\n\nThe testimony pushed Mr. Trump far outside his campaign-trail comfort zone to the controlled environs of a courtroom, where lying is a crime and outbursts can land you in contempt of court. The deeply personal nature of the trial for Mr. Trump, 77, whose obsession with his wealth is a defining feature of his celebrity, injected an extra dose of emotion into his testimony.\n\nMr. Trump is fighting Ms. James’s civil case while facing four criminal indictments implicating him in everything from a hush-money deal with a porn star to an attempt to undermine American democracy. While the cases are a distraction during his third White House run, Mr. Trump’s lead has only grown. He has cast himself as a political martyr under attack from Democrats like Ms. James and Justice Engoron.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the testimony, Ms. James said that Mr. Trump had “rambled” and “hurled insults” but that “evidence demonstrated that in fact, he falsely inflated his assets to basically enrich himself and his family.”\n\nChristopher M. Kise, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, thought otherwise: “In my 33 years, I have not had a witness testify better,” he said.\n\nEven before Ms. James’s case went to trial, Justice Engoron had ruled that Mr. Trump’s financial statements were filled with fraud.\n\nThe trial will determine the punishment. Ms. James wants Mr. Trump to pay a $250 million penalty, be ousted from his company and be permanently barred from the world of New York real estate.\n\nOn Monday, as Mr. Wallace questioned Mr. Trump, the former president turned to the judge and lamented the way he had accepted Ms. James’s central contention before any evidence was heard in court: “You believed this political hack back there, and that’s unfortunate.”\n\n“Done?” asked Mr. Wallace, like a parent asking a child if he was finished with a tantrum.\n\n“Done,” responded Mr. Trump, and the questioning continued.\n\nThroughout the roughly four hours of testimony, Mr. Trump alternately accepted and avoided responsibility. When Mr. Wallace asked how he ensured that the financial statements were handled properly, he passed the buck to financial lieutenants and outside auditors, saying, “I gave two people total authority to work with a very expensive accounting firm.”\n\nMr. Trump added, though, that he was not entirely hands-off: “I said, ‘Prepare the statements so that the accounting firm is happy.’”\n\nFrequently, Mr. Wallace drew Mr. Trump in with simple questions about whether he had depended on the banks to rely on his financial statements. Mr. Trump affirmed that he had, without seeming to realize that the question went to intent, a necessary element for Ms. James’s lawyers to show.\n\nHe also couldn’t resist exaggerating in exactly the fashion that has left him vulnerable to the attorney general’s claims. When asked how big his triplex in Trump Tower is, he at first provided the accurate answer, 11,000 square feet. Seemingly unable to stop himself, he then said 12,000. Then, he said 13,000.\n\nMr. Trump also said that he had directed his employees to drop the value of his Westchester County, N.Y., estate, Seven Springs, because he “thought it was too high,” another acknowledgment of his involvement in the financial statements.\n\nWhile that appeared to undercut Mr. Trump’s task on the stand — to distance himself from the valuation of his net worth — parts of his testimony may have helped him.\n\nMr. Trump gave a tutorial of sorts on real estate valuations, noting that a lower cash flow in a given year might not depress the overall value of his flagship office building in the Financial District. And he pointed out that the banks he is accused of defrauding actually made money, arguing that they were hardly victims.\n\nHe also spoke about moments of restraint.\n\nWhen asked whether he approved the valuation for an office building, Mr. Trump said that he accepted it, not that he approved it, and did not instruct anyone to alter it. Asked if it was based on true and accurate information, the former president replied, “I hope so.”\n\nMr. Trump testified that he had an opinion on the worth of his properties, especially his Florida estate. “I thought that Mar-a-Lago was very underestimated, but I didn’t do anything about it,” he said. “I just left it be.”\n\nBut his expansive answers irritated the judge. As Mr. Trump spoke lovingly about Mar-a-Lago, calling it “beautiful” and a “success,” Justice Engoron looked up at the ceiling. The more Mr. Trump speechified, the more Justice Engoron rolled his eyes.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump blurted that Aberdeen was the oil capital of Europe, Justice Engoron barked, “Irrelevant, irrelevant. Answer the question.”\n\nIn a criminal case, a jury or judge cannot hold a defendant's refusal to answer questions against him. But this case is civil, and the rules are different: A judge can make what is called a “negative inference” — a damning assumption about why a defendant won’t answer.\n\nAt one point Monday, the judge, fed up with Mr. Trump’s nonresponsive responses, threatened to excuse the former president from the stand and assume the worst about why he wouldn’t answer.\n\nJustice Engoron also repeatedly appealed to Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Mr. Kise, to rein in the former president. As Mr. Trump puckered his lips and shrugged his shoulders, Mr. Kise replied that Mr. Trump’s stature — as the “former and again soon-to-be chief executive of the United States” — afforded him leeway.\n\n“Mr. Kise, can you control your client? This is not a political rally,” Judge Engoron said in the opening moments of the testimony, adding, “We’ll be here forever, and we’ll accomplish nothing.”\n\nBy the time Mr. Trump got up to leave the stand at the end of the day, the judge appeared relieved. He turned to the former president and held up his left hand in a goodbye wave.\n\nKate Christobek , Maggie Haberman , Nate Schweber , Liset Cruz , Claire Fahy and Susanne Craig contributed reporting.\n\nAlmost as soon as Mr. Trump took the stand on Monday morning, his penchant for long monologues appeared to irk Justice Engoron.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump gave one particularly lengthy answer, the judge turned and asked him to restrain himself, saying that he would like to move things along. “Please no speeches,” he told the former president. Mr. Trump sneered.\n\nNext, Justice Engoron pleaded with one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Christopher M. Kise, to control his client. “This is not a political rally,” he said. When Mr. Kise said that the judge should want to hear from the former president, Justice Engoron disagreed, saying that many of Mr. Trump’s comments were irrelevant. Mr. Trump sat silent for a moment before resuming his testimony.\n\nAt one point early in the day, an exasperated Justice Engoron suggested that he might wield some of the considerable power he has over witnesses in order to rein in Mr. Trump — including booting the former president from the stand entirely.\n\nSuch a move would have been deeply damaging to Mr. Trump’s case; it would have permitted the judge to make negative assumptions about questions that the former president did not answer. For Democrats and others who have long fantasized about Mr. Trump getting what they saw as a comeuppance, that possibility was tantalizing.\n\nBut after the midmorning break, the judge appeared less interested in cutting off Mr. Trump’s off-topic soliloquies. He allowed Mr. Trump to speak at length, as the former president praised one of his golf courses as “an artistic expression” and attacked the state attorney general, Letitia James, and the lawyer questioning him, Kevin Wallace.\n\nThe judge explained why he was giving Mr. Trump more latitude: Mr. Wallace, he said, seemed to be happy with what he was getting from his combative witness.\n\nAnd so Justice Engoron said nothing when Mr. Trump referred to Ms. James as a “political hack” or even when the former president turned and attacked him directly as a fraud.\n\nRather than a war of words, the two septuagenarians turned the courtroom into a contest of irritated expressions: The judge frowned, Mr. Trump glowered. The judge grinned sarcastically, Mr. Trump smirked — and smirked some more.\n\nAs Justice Engoron repeatedly overruled Mr. Trump’s lawyers’ objections, Mr. Trump again and again turned away from him and smirked. He smirked and cocked his head. He smirked and shrugged. He smirked and looked at the ceiling.\n\nBut as the judge gave him more leash, Mr. Trump took it.\n\nAt one interval, he pointed toward the judge directly and lamented a past ruling. “He called me a fraud and he doesn’t know anything about me!” Mr. Trump said.\n\nBy the afternoon, Mr. Trump was letting his facial expressions convey his disdain explicitly, punctuated by the occasional outburst.\n\n“You have no case,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Wallace at one point. “This case is a disgrace.”\n\nThose comments flew without comment from Justice Engoron. But the judge had a line he would not allow the former president to cross. Shortly before the lunch break, Mr. Trump asked to read a disclaimer that was included on his annual financial statements into the record.\n\n“I’d love to read this, your honor, if I’m allowed to do that,” the former president said, laying on the charm for a moment.\n\nThe judge told him he could not, at that point.\n\n“Shocker,” Mr. Trump said, making a sarcastic face.""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/11/06/trump-testimony-ny-fraud-trial/', 'Headline': 'Trump completes testimony in N.Y. civil fraud trial', 'Snippet': 'Devlin Barrett.

He told the group: “If you send Jon and the reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door, restoring hope and decency and honor for so many people,” he said.\n\nHe also noted: “And if you send (Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler) back to Washington, those checks will never get there…”\n\nDuring his speech, Biden told attendees: “The power is literally in your hands, unlike any time in my career. One state, one state can chart the course not just for the next four years but for a generation.”\n\nHe also stated: “The debate over $2,000 isn’t some abstract debate in Washington, it’s about real lives.

The Capitol Police has not said exactly how many officers were guarding the Capitol building itself.\n\nThe time it took for reinforcements to arrive: 15 minutes (but it\'s complicated)\n\nThe Capitol complex was breached on Jan. 6 about 1:50 p.m. Though some District of Columbia police officers responded within 15 minutes, the Pentagon took more than three hours to send National Guard troops to aide Capitol Police, according to Maj. Gen. William J. Walker. But a watchdog report is critical of this timeline.\n\nDeaths from the insurrection: 5 (or more)\n\nMost news sources have officially counted five deaths including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died after suffering two strokes, and San Diego resident Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by Capitol Police while climbing a barricaded door inside the Capitol. But some in Congress — including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) — have suggested the number of deaths is closer to nine and should include officers who committed suicide in the days and months following the attack.\n\nOfficers injured: More than 140\n\nMore than 140 law enforcement officers were physically harmed during the insurrection, according to a special congressional committee investigating the attack. In a July hearing, a District of Columbia police officer recounted a chaotic and violent day where he was tased in the head several times by rioters and beaten unconscious.\n\nPeople arrested: More than 700\n\nMore than 700 people have been arrested in connection with the insurrection, but the investigation is ongoing. More than 30 of those arrests were in California. The FBI is still seeking the public’s help to identify rioters.\n\nHours the certification of electors was delayed: More than 13\n\nThe Capitol was breached about 1:50 p.m. The Senate called a recess about 2:11 p.m. The Capitol was declared secure at 8 p.m.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) brought the House back into session at 9 p.m., and Vice President Mike Pence officially declared Joe Biden president-elect at 3:42 a.m. the next day.\n\nCost of cleanup and repairs: $1.5 million to more than $30 million\n\nTotal damages have been estimated to cost anywhere from $1.5 million to more than $30 million and include repairs and security measures like fencing.\n\nRioters left behind feces, blood, bullet holes, graffiti and bear repellent. Curators have requested $25,000 to restore historic artwork, including the bust of a U.S. politician accused of inciting another violent attack in the Capitol in 1954 — an armed group of four demanding Puerto Rico’s independence.\n\nPeople subpoenaed by Congress: 50-plus\n\nCongress has issued 51 subpoenas and counting in its investigation into the siege. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Trump advisor Stephen K. Bannon are among those subpoenaed. Members of far-right extremist groups like the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have also been drawn into the investigation for their roles in planning and orchestrating the riot.\n\nJan. 6-related lawsuits involving Trump: At least 5\n\nThe insurrection has spawned more than five lawsuits, all involving Trump. A group of House Democrats, some Capitol Police officers and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Dublin) filed separate lawsuits against Trump for his role in inciting the mob to overtake the Capitol.\n\nTrump has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review his lawsuit to block the release of White House records relating to the attack.

It’s part of a series of “Save America” rallies that he’s hosting. Here’s a look at how many people attended Trump’s rally, including crowd photos and updates about what happened. Opinions on how large the crowd was varied from person to person attending.\n\nThousands Attended Trump’s Georgia Rally, With Some Saying Attendance Was Smaller than Normal & Others Saying Attendance Was ‘Massive’\n\nThe rally took place at the Banks County Dragway (formerly known as the NHRA International Dragway) in Commerce, Georgia. Although doors opened in the afternoon, Trump’s speech was scheduled to begin around 7 p.m. Eastern, but he began about an hour late, Athens Banner-Herald reported.\n\nThe event was in part to support local Republican candidates or politicians, Athens Banner-Herald reported. Those on the speakers list included Herschel Walker and Sen. David Perdue who is running for governor. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was also among the people scheduled to speak.\n\nOpinions about crowd size varied. Some in attendance said the crowd was “massive.” However, other reporters said the crowd was much smaller than Trump used to attract. Here’s a look at the various reports. It’s not known if local police will share an official estimate, but we will add it to this story if they do.\n\nStephen Fowler of GPB News (an NPR affiliate) attended the rally and estimated on Twitter that there were about 5,000 people in attendance. He wrote that it was “the smallest Trump rally I’ve ever covered here.” He said it was much smaller than the 20,000 to 30,000-size rallies that Trump had hosted in 2020.\n\nGreg Bluestein of Atlanta-Journal Constitution shared a photo during the rally indicating that the crowd behind the TV risers didn’t extend “as far as the eye could see,” as Trump had said it did.\n\nFowler also shared a photo of the crowd, which was large but didn’t extend quite as far back as past rally crowds have done.\n\nHowever, Joshua L. Jones of the Athens Banner-Herald tweeted that around 5:30 p.m. Eastern, there was a “massive crowd” at the rally, and shared a photo of a packed crowd.\n\nBurt Jones, a conservative running for Lieutenant Governor, described the crowd as “huge.”\n\nTrump quickly began his speech by calling the current Governor Brian Kemp a “RINO,” as he supported one of Kemp’s opponents. He commented that he was angry that he had supported Kemp in the past.\n\nFowler later shared a photo showing the crowd differences between 8:50, 8:20, and 7:20. He said the cold and windy weather was leading some to leave early, while Trump was still speaking.\n\nTrump also commented to attendees that he believed Georgia was “red as hell” and voting for Perdue would be “a vote for this country.”\n\nAt one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz said he would nominate Trump to be the Speaker of the House.\n\nThis happened while Trump was bringing some of the candidates he endorsed, along with others, to speak on the stage with him.\n\nTrump Has Two More Rallies Scheduled\n\nTrump has two more rallies scheduled over the next two weeks, according to his website. A rally in Washington, Michigan, is taking place on April 2 at 7 p.m. Eastern at the Michigan Star Sports Center. And a rally in Selma, North Carolina, is taking place on April 9 at 7 p.m. Eastern at The Farm at 95.\n\nTrump’s first rally of 2022 was in Florence, Arizona in mid-January. Trump held a September rally in Georgia. He also held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, in October 2021, a rally in Alabama in August 2021, and an Ohio rally in June 2021. He also held a rally in Conroe, Texas, in January that was attended by tens of thousands, according to media at the event.\n\nIn his August Alabama rally, he was booed after telling the people present to take the vaccines. He replied: “You know what? I believe totally in your freedoms, I do. You have to do what you have to do. But, I recommend take the vaccines, I did it, it’s good. Take the vaccines.”\n\nTrump has not yet announced if he is running in the 2024 presidential election. However, he did tell the crowd during his speech in South Carolina that “we may have to run again,” and added “we will take back the White House.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://factcheck.afp.com/misleads-attendance-trump-biden-campaign-events', 'Headline': 'Posts use photos to inaccurately compare campaign events', 'Snippet': ""Drive-in rallies and town halls via Zoom and broadcast on television have become a staple of the Democrat's mostly low-key and mostly virtual campaign, as he scrupulously adhered to social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines to guard against the coronavirus..

The 30-year fixed rate mortgage peaked at 7.79% on Oct. 26, 2023. That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.', 'Full_text': 'Before former President Donald Trump spoke for 90 minutes in Durham, New Hampshire, his team compared Trump’s record with President Joe Biden’s record by projecting a series of statistics on the wall.\n\nThe images shown Dec. 16 had the tagline ""Better off with Trump"" and covered mortgage payments, mortgage rates and inflation.\n\nHere’s a fact-check of three statements. The Trump campaign did not answer an inquiry for this article.\n\nSome of the statistics cited on projections at Donald Trump’s rally Dec. 16, 2023, in Durham, N.H. (Rebecca Catalanello/PolitiFact)\n\n""Under Joe Biden, we’ve had a three-year inflation rate of 20%.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe standard inflation measure, the consumer price index, has risen by 17.2% since January 2021, when Biden took office. That was an increase over three years, so the annual inflation rate was lower — about 5.9% per year during Biden’s presidency.\n\nRising wages have helped consumers manage some of this increase in prices.\n\nA standard wage measure, average hourly earnings of all private-sector employees, has risen by 14% during Biden’s presidency, or about 4.8% per year. That means wages are still trailing inflation by about 1.1% a year, but it’s a smaller gap than Trump’s headline number.\n\nThe time frame for the calculation also matters.\n\nAs inflation has cooled over the past year, wage gains have narrowed the cumulative shortfall from inflation. Since November 2022, inflation has risen by 3.1%, but wages have risen by 4%. If the pattern holds, wage growth during Biden’s presidency may soon surpass the increase in prices.\n\nAlso, Americans are in a better place than they were on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, which started during Trump’s last year in office. Since February 2020, the last full month before the pandemic hit, inflation has increased by 18.8%, while wages have increased by 19.4%.\n\n""After three years of Bidenomics, the 30-year mortgage rate has hit a 22-year high.""\n\nThis is Mostly True. Numerically, Trump is on target. However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage peaked at 7.79% on Oct. 26, 2023. That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.\n\nMortgage rates have spiked because the Federal Reserve in March 2022 began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Fed interest rate hikes are considered the most effective economic tools for curbing inflation, because they tend to cool the economy, which eases demand and lowers prices.\n\nSince the Fed hikes began, inflation has receded by about two-thirds. But a side effect has been that other types of interest rates — including mortgages — have also risen.\n\nSince the mortgage rate peak in October, the average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has fallen, hitting 6.67% on Dec. 21. Not counting the peak in recent months, that’s still higher than any rate going back to Aug. 2, 2007, when the rate was 6.68%.\n\nEconomists generally agree that some of Biden’s policies likely added to the pressures that pushed up prices.\n\nBiden’s coronavirus relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, put stimulus money into Americans’ hands when supply chains couldn’t produce enough goods to fulfill consumer demand. This worsened the rise of prices, which started because of pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions.\n\nHowever, ""the drivers of this inflation go back to COVID-19 — issues like supply-chain constraints, workforce shortages, and other factors,"" John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, told PolitiFact West Virginia in October. ""That is much larger than any particular Biden policy.""\n\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said Biden should ""assume some responsibility, but so should members of Congress who voted in favor of stimulus payments, tax cuts, generous unemployment benefits, aid to states and private businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic recession.""\n\nThe American Rescue Plan got no Republican support in Congress, but earlier pandemic relief bills Trump signed were passed with bipartisan support.\n\n""The average monthly mortgage payment: Under Trump, $1,746; Under Biden: $3,322.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThese are the figures for average monthly payments on a new home, real estate company CBRE reports. That’s a significant out-of-pocket increase for someone buying a new home, but it doesn’t affect homeowners who aren’t looking to move.\n\nThe figure is calculated for the purchase of a new home valued at the U.S. median of $430,000, with a 10% down payment.\n\nThe majority of American mortgage holders have fixed-rate mortgages that were locked in at much lower rates. In 2022, about 85% of mortgages had fixed rates.\n\nGiven the current high rates, adjustable-rate mortgages are gaining popularity. If mortgage rates decrease in 2024, homeowners who hold adjustable-rate mortgages should see their payments drop.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.goerie.com/story/news/politics/elections/presidential/2023/08/03/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-crowd-size-says-about-enthusiasm-gop-candidate-president-2024-election/70499355007/', 'Headline': ""What Trump's Erie rally crowd size says about enthusiasm for candidate"", 'Snippet': ""How did Trump's July 29, 2023 rally compare to previous appearances? ... legislators Donald Trump's Erie rally attendance: ... about voting for Donald Trump, but they will do it if Joe Biden is ..."", 'Full_text': 'Unlimited access to and our apps.\n\nThe eNewspaper: a digital replica of the newspaper.\n\nAdd a user to your digital subscription for free.\n\nUnlimited access to and our apps.\n\nThe eNewspaper: a digital replica of the newspaper.\n\nAdd a user to your digital subscription for free.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-draws-massive-crowd-50k-small-south-carolina-town-3400-police', 'Headline': 'Trump draws massive crowd of at least 50K in small South ... - Fox News', 'Snippet': ""An estimated crowd of at least 50,000 attended former President Trump's rally in Pickens, South Carolina, a town of only 3,400 residents.

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize.

The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January.

Here are the findings, with additional context.\n\n1. Beginning election night and continuing through Jan. 6 and thereafter, Donald Trump purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions. These false claims provoked his supporters to violence on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: This reflects the committee’s finding that Mr. Trump’s repeated false claims that the election was rigged had both a political and financial motive. During its second hearing, the panel introduced evidence that Trump supporters donated nearly $100 million to Mr. Trump’s so-called Election Defense Fund but that the money flowed instead into a super PAC the president had created. It was not just “the big lie,” the committee said. It was also “the big rip-off.”\n\n2. Knowing that he and his supporters had lost dozens of election lawsuits, and despite his own senior advisers refuting his election fraud claims and urging him to concede his election loss, Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome.\n\nAnnotation: Mr. Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results of the election and lost all but one of them. Many of the suits, the committee determined, were brought even after some of Mr. Trump’s closest aides — including his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and his attorney general, William P. Barr — told him that there was no fraud that could have changed the outcome of the race.\n\n3. Despite knowing that such an action would be illegal, and that no state had or would submit an altered electoral slate, Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress’s joint session on Jan. 6.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/17-key-findings-executive-summary-194223594.html', 'Headline': 'The 17 key findings from the executive summary of the Jan. 6 ... - Yahoo', 'Snippet': 'The summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C.

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January. McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt.""\n\nNew York Gov.

The venue’s general manager told the Orange County Register at the time it opted to cancel after learning Gaetz and Greene would be speaking.\n\nThe rally was moved to the Riverside Convention Center, but the city quickly started receiving complaints. Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers “are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.”\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue’s conditional use permit would be “in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.”\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a “peaceful protest against communism” outside Riverside City Hall.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/07/14/gop-reps-marjorie-taylor-greene-matt-gaetz-are-suing-riverside-anaheim/', 'Headline': 'GOP Reps.

Greene and Gaetz, widely viewed as two of the most far-right members of Congress, have shown sympathy for many of the rioters and have attempted to visit the D.C. jail where some riot defendants are being held, to inspect conditions at the facility. Gaetz notably spread a conspiracy theory on the House floor just hours after the attack, claiming that some of the rioters may have been “antifa terrorists.” Greene, meanwhile, has recently compared the riot at the Capitol to the Declaration of Independence, saying it was an attempt to “overthrow tyrants.”\n\nTangent\n\nAs time passes, right-wing condemnation of the attack has gradually been replaced by conspiracy theories. Tucker Carlson, a Fox News prime-time host who anchors the most popular show on cable news, released a three-part series in October called “Patriot Purge.” The series repeated the baseless claim that the January 6 attack was a “false flag” operation actually orchestrated by the government—a notion that has been repeatedly debunked.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Calls Off Press Conference On Capitol Attack Anniversary (Forbes)'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/4/4/23669635/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-indictment-protest', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene’s protest for Trump is a zany flop - Vox', 'Snippet': 'The New York Young Republicans pointedly described the Tuesday rally as a “peaceful protest” that called out the political persecution of Trump’s indictment, with Greene warning participants ...', 'Full_text': 'Rep.

The rally, which Greene led alongside the New York Young Republicans, drew a crowd of a few dozen Trump supporters, counterprotesters, and curious New Yorkers — all of whom appeared to be outnumbered by media.\n\nThe rally in Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Court House, was less a protest and more like a bizarro carnival. Trump’s Tuesday arraignment took place on an rare New York spring day, which added to the frenetic vibe, as though everyone was unleashed after a long winter.\n\nThe MAGA hats and flags were out, as were a contingent of counterprotesters, imperfectly separated by metal barriers. New Yorkers mingled among them — an artist, a high schooler with a few free periods — who claimed to have wandered down to Lower Manhattan to witness history, or at least the spectacle.

The sparse attendance by other elected Republicans highlighted the limitations of what members of the party might be willing to do for Trump, even though they’ve broadly lambasted the charges against him as politically motivated and unfounded.\n\nGreene’s headlining of the event comes after Trump previously called for his supporters to “protest” the charges, a rallying cry that raised concerns of a repeat of the deadly January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when the former president similarly asked supporters to contest the election results. Embattled Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was also spotted by reporters in the crowd of the protest, and was seen headed toward the courthouse where the arraignment was set to take place. Other than that, maybe the highest-profile public figure was the Naked Cowboy.\n\nJanuary 6’s violence — and its legal fallout — have complicated efforts to drum up support for pro-Trump protests. While many lawmakers are eager to show their support for Trump, they’ve largely chosen to do so through fundraising efforts. A previous New York protest on March 20 was also poorly attended, and protests in South Carolina and California drew small crowds this past week as well. Most GOP lawmakers appear unwilling to put themselves in a position where they could be linked to Trump-related violence, and in the face of ongoing trials for insurrectionists, grassroots supporters appear hesitant to do so as well.\n\nThe New York Young Republicans pointedly described the Tuesday rally as a “peaceful protest” that called out the political persecution of Trump’s indictment, with Greene warning participants against violence. The crowd greeted Marjorie Taylor Green’s arrival to the rally with cheers and jeers, but throughout the morning until Trump’s arrival in Lower Manhattan, the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nRepublicans in general have harshly criticized the indictment and framed it as a way for Democrats to attack Trump yet again. Leaders like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), however, have previously urged “calmness” and pushed back on Trump’s calls for protest. They have assisted with the former president’s efforts to use the indictment to raise money, though. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) solicited donations on Fox News, for example, and the Trump campaign claims it’s brought in over $7 million in the past few days.\n\nThe lukewarm Republican response to Trump’s calls for protests, however, indicate that many in the GOP are only willing to go so far, particularly as the specter of the January 6 insurrection continues to loom over the party.\n\n“I think they calculate that they can take a goldilocks strategy — stay in the good graces of their base by not attacking him, but maintain plausible deniability in the future by not attending a protest,” says American University government professor David Barker.\n\nTrump is back, and no one seems to know quite what to make of it\n\nTuesday in Collect Pond Park, Trump supporters were angry about Trump’s indictment, but there was also a sense of anticipation: The thing Trump always said would happen — that he’d be targeted by an establishment that was out to get him — did. They were here to defend Trump, to support him, pray for him, and commiserate together.\n\nMelinda, 61, who drove up to New York from outside Fall’s Church, Virginia, sat on a bench in the park, hours before Trump’s arraignment. “I’m here to pray for the safety of the city and the people and President Trump,” she said.\n\nShe added that she loved her president, pointing to a pin of the presidential seal on the collar of the jacket. For her, the charges felt larger than just Trump. “What’s happening is they’re about to open a Pandora’s box. Because now, nobody’s safe,” Melinda said. “Any president, VP, Supreme Court justice, can now be publicly arrested, so I think it will boomerang.”\n\nThe crowd got bigger as the morning wore on and Trump’s arraignment loomed. There were red hats, of course, but maybe not as many as you might think. The rest fell into two camps: folks in sunglasses and T-shirts, as if they were NYC tourists; and the over-the-top. That included a guy in a banana suit — “Banana Republic” costume, as he explained — with a copy of the US Constitution in his hand.\n\nThe closer to Trump’s arraignment it got, the weirder it got, too: a woman, her body painted white, in a diaper. An Abe Lincoln. A guy in an orange jumpsuit, wearing a Trump mask. As inmate Trump worked the crowd, one woman pointed directly at him. “It’s Hillary Clinton,” she said, ignoring his face. “Hey, Hillary, you finally got locked up.”\n\nAnti-Trump protesters also filtered through. Jojo Keys, 39, from Manhattan, said he was an independent who had come to witness history. When Taylor Green entered the park, he jumped up and down, shouting “Liar, liar!”\n\nThere were also “Fuck Joe Biden” cheers and “USA” chants, and there was a cowbell, somewhere, of course. But mostly, the currency was signs. The ones you know: Make America Great, Trump 2024, Stop the Steal, Q. And then some new ones on the scene, some better than others: “Salem 1692 / Bragg 2023.” “From Build Back Better to Biden, Bragg, Banana Republic in 2 Years.”\n\nMichael Austin, a 59-year-old Manhattanite, had the Build Back Better to Banana Republic sign, which he rested at his feet. In his hands, he held a “Fags for Trump” sign. “It is a seven-year-long, slow-rolling constant coup d’etat,” Austin said. “They have used the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the DHS, and foreign spy agencies to persecute a reformer, who came to reform the corrupt system, and they don’t like it.”\n\nPretty much everyone had cameras out, filming or photographing the scene for their own memories, and maybe to make sure that they had evidence in case anything happened.\n\nThough nothing really did. People cheered, they chatted, they waited. Trump arrived at the courthouse in the afternoon, the crowd noting his arrival with helicopters overhead. “Trump is in the house,” one woman called out. But otherwise, the crowd stood, behind a fence and behind rows of television cameras, facing the court house, knowing, at least, that the former president was inside.\n\nThe lingering impact of January 6\n\nTrump’s calls for protests, which the former president posted in March as he anticipated the indictment, follow significant fallout from the January 6 insurrection. The storming of the Capitol ultimately led to five deaths, 140 injured police officers, and hundreds of arrests. It’s also proven to be politically damaging for Republicans following an intensive investigation by Congress’s January 6 committee, with polling showing that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the attack.\n\nConcerns about the violence that occurred on January 6 have hung over these potential rallies as well, with New York Mayor Eric Adams calling on Taylor Greene and other protesters to be on their “best behavior.” Multiple Republican lawmakers have made similar requests of Trump supporters, like McCarthy, who said in mid-March that “there should not be any violence.”\n\nRelatedly, pro-Trump backers have signaled reluctance about these protests amid concerns they could be a trap laid by federal agents, after more than a thousand people have been charged following the insurrection. As CNN’s Sean Lyngaas, Zachary Cohen, and Donie O’Sullivan reported, pro-Trump forums have included speculation that these demonstrations were a “set up” intended to pin blame on them for violence caused by other groups, like the antifa or antifascist movement. (On January 6, this incorrect theory was used by some Republicans to obscure the role of Trump supporters in the violence and damage that was caused.) An expert also told CNN that Trump backers may be seeking alternate routes to oppose the indictment including specific targeting of officials like District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe combination of lawmakers’ own apparent political concerns, and Trump supporters’ practical worries about a law enforcement “set up,” seem to have dampened the involvement in protests this week.\n\nFor Republican lawmakers, there’s been an ongoing balancing act regarding their backing for Trump. If they were to actively criticize and condemn him, they risk serious electoral blowback much like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who lost her Republican House primary. Tying themselves too closely to Trump, however, also comes with its own risks, particularly for lawmakers in more moderate states and districts. In the 2022 midterms, election-denier candidates in battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan broadly lost. And there are still a lot of unknowns about Trump’s legal woes, as he faces other potential charges in cases involving overturning the election results and his role in January 6.\n\n“Now they must calculate not just the current rank-and-file GOP rallying around Trump, but also what happens if more indictments tumble down in the coming months,” says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\n\nThese collective factors, it seems, have curbed the interest in these protests for now.\n\nUpdate, 5 pm ET: This story has been updated with crowd reactions throughout the arraignment day.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6186037/matt-gaetz-marjorie-taylor-greene-maga-house-republicans/', 'Headline': 'The MAGA Squad Is Building Power to Control the GOP Congress', 'Snippet': 'Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene and most hard-core, pro-Trump House Republicans have spent the past year building leverage and clout. ... (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his ...', 'Full_text': ""On a Tuesday afternoon in late April, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene walks into the seventh-floor congressional office belonging to Representative Matt Gaetz, settles into a high-backed black leather chair, and fits a pair of headphones over her blonde hair. The taping is about to begin for the 38th episode of Gaetz’s “Firebrand” podcast, and Greene is the high-wattage guest star.\n\nGreene has come straight from Dulles Airport, so Gaetz takes a minute to catch her up on today’s topics before the recording starts. There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her. She knows really well how to wield power.” Why vote against a man you’ve already got wrapped around your little finger?\n\n“The critique of McCarthy is not that he has ignored us, or pretended like we don’t exist,” Gaetz adds with a broad grin. “In fact, he’s highly responsive to us.”\n\nThe MAGA Squad: They’re here. They’re weird. And pretty soon, they may be in control of the GOP Congress—if they aren’t already.\n\nWith reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian""}}",90.4,2

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/factchecking-claims-about-the-jan-6-capitol-riot/', 'Headline': 'FactChecking Claims About the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot', 'Snippet': 'Trump supporters clash with police and security forces at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. ... Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/politics/security-failures-january-6-committee-blue-team/index.html', 'Headline': 'January 6 committee probes security failures as GOP counter ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Davis recently wrote to Pelosi to say his team had reviewed Capitol Hill security footage in the lead-up to January 6, 2021, and found no evidence of Republican lawmakers organizing ...', 'Full_text': 'More than 80 officials from law enforcement and federal agencies have testified to the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, including members of the Secret Service, in what investigators believe will be the most extensive review yet of security failures that led to the US Capitol breach.\n\nThe House select committee’s so-called “blue team” is focused on understanding the threats leading up to attack, how intelligence was shared among law enforcement and their preparations. In addition to depositions, the team has thousands of documents from more than a dozen agencies that other security reviews didn’t have, two committee aides tell CNN.\n\nWhile much of what the Democrat-led committee has made public so far has centered around the plotting by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election, aides and lawmakers say this behind-the-scenes review might lead to the bulk of their legislative recommendations and have the most lasting impact.\n\n“We really need to bear down on those things that we think need to be done from strengthening the windows, so they’re unbreakable, all the way up to potential reforms of the electoral count act and protection of the right to vote,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat on the committee. “We need to spend some real time talking about the policy recommendations and dimension of this.”\n\nAt the same time, Republicans have launched their own investigation into security lapses on January 6, 2021, and plan to release recommendations. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and GOP lawmakers involved in the effort have made clear they will focus, at least in part, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s role.\n\n“The reports that come out of the select committee are based upon anything that’s anti-President Trump,” said Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican who has used his position as the ranking member on the House Administration Committee to look into security issues.\n\nThe competing investigations underscore that January 6 remains a polarizing issue – turning even typically nonpartisan issues like security into partisan flash points – and that questions remain about how breakdowns happened and what improvements can be made to ensure such an attack never happens again.\n\nSecurity lapses scrutinized\n\nOver the past year, several reviews have examined various aspects of law enforcement failures, but some ran into challenges collecting information and none has been able to fully assess the federal, local and congressional response as a whole.\n\nFor example, congressional aides who worked on a Senate report released in June said that federal law enforcement agencies didn’t provide all of the information investigators requested. And the Capitol Police inspector general produced several reports but noted investigators spoke to about 35 officers, despite efforts to interview dozens more.\n\nThe inspectors general from the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security also plan to produce reports on their findings.\n\nThe House select committee’s blue team review is much broader than previous ones, aides say.\n\n“There’s a tremendous amount of more information that we have, that the Senate report did not have or any of the IG reports do not have in terms of the amount of interviews we’ve conducted,” one of the aides told CNN.\n\nThe committee’s sweeping probe includes several investigative teams, each with their own color designation. The green team, for example, is tasked with tracking money, including the funding behind the pro-Trump rallies that preceded the attack. In all, they have interviewed more than 750 people and subpoenaed thousands of records.\n\nIn contrast to the work of other teams, some of whom have had to confront recalcitrant witnesses and lawsuits seeking to block their subpoenas, the aide said witnesses for the blue team have been cooperative – and largely content to stay out of the public eye.\n\n“I don’t have folks storming out of my (depositions) and then going to the press,” the aide said.\n\n“It’s just it’s people who are genuinely concerned about what happened and want to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”\n\nAides say the witnesses have included current and former law enforcement officials, from first responders to high-ranking officers, and from the Secret Service, which has publicly revealed little about their operations that day.\n\nThe team expects to propose legislative fixes as well as administrative changes related to law enforcement and physical security at the Capitol.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a member of the committee, told CNN those proposals could address streamlining the process by which the Capitol Police chief gets approval to call on the National Guard, which led to issues on January 6, and how intelligence-gathering and information-sharing happens across various agencies. As chair of the House Administration Committee, which oversees Capitol Police, Lofgren has already spearheaded efforts to improve Capitol security.\n\n“Along with the entire investigation, we want to know everything that led up to and on the day of the 6th,” Lofgren said. “Now, part of that obviously is the law enforcement preparation for January 6, how they responded to the riot as it was happening, the shortcomings, and what recommendations we want to improve the situation in the future.”\n\nGOP investigation\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, McCarthy pledged last year that Republicans would pursue their own “investigation of the facts” after Pelosi rejected his picks to sit on the House Select Committee. Since then, two of the three Republicans vetoed by Pelosi have quietly undertaken the task.\n\nDavis and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana have teamed up to informally investigate security failures. No Republican member can subpoena witness testimony or documents without the help of Democrats, so any information they have collected has been through voluntary cooperation.\n\nDavis declined to specify who he and his fellow Republicans have interviewed or what documents they’ve collected but noted several whistleblowers have come forward through a website his committee launched in the months following the riot. Davis said he doesn’t have faith the House select committee will dig deeply enough.\n\n“I don’t think enough focus is going to be placed upon the failures of the security apparatus pre-January 6 that needs to be investigated,” Davis said, recalling that he got a security briefing from Capitol Police on January 5 in his office. “There was nothing in that briefing that would have led me to believe that I would have witnessed what I saw on January 6.”\n\nTwo sources close to the GOP investigation say they have interviewed dozens of witnesses, including rank-and-file law enforcement and top brass. Their report may be timed to coincide with the House Select Committee’s public hearings, the sources said – illustrating that they see their investigative effort as a counterweight to the committee’s work.\n\nDavis recently wrote to Pelosi to say his team had reviewed Capitol Hill security footage in the lead-up to January 6, 2021, and found no evidence of Republican lawmakers organizing “reconnaissance” tours as has been previously suggested by certain Democratic members.\n\nLofgren said Republicans are politicizing the issue of Capitol Hill security and discredited the GOP notion that Pelosi is somehow responsible for any breakdowns.\n\n“It’s obviously B.S., and it’s totally motivated by their effort to turn everything into a political game,” Lofgren said.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check/jan-6-capitol-pelosi', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist', 'Snippet': 'Efforts to blame Speaker Nancy Pelosi for security failures are baseless. ... or even played a role in delays over approval. And as speaker, Ms. Pelosi does not directly oversee security ...', 'Full_text': 'A mountain of evidence shows that the rioters were supporters of Mr. Trump, but that has not stopped the cascade of specious claims seeking to pin responsibility on others.\n\nA false theory blaming agitators affiliated with antifa, a loose collection of antifascist activists, began to spread on social media before the riot had even ended. Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/nov/21/instagram-posts/footage-of-nancy-pelosi-on-jan-6-2021-doesnt-prove/', 'Headline': 'PolitiFact | Footage of Nancy Pelosi on Jan. 6, 2021, doesn’t prove ...', 'Snippet': 'A Nov. 19 Instagram reel showed two clips from Jan. 6, 2021, of then-House Speaker Pelosi speaking on the phone with then-Vice President Mike Pence about when members of Congress would be able to ...', 'Full_text': 'Following news that House Speaker Mike Johnson would release 44,000 hours of footage from Jan. 6, 2021, social media users are claiming pre-existing videos of Rep.

Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and holds a phone. Pence says on speaker phone: ""I’m at the Capitol building. I’m literally standing with the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police. … They believe that the House and the Senate will be able to reconvene in roughly an hour.""\n\nThe second clip shows Schumer holding the phone with Pelosi and Sen.

It’s called a movie, with great actors, central casting ‘cause it’s all a show.""\n\n(Screengrab from Instagram)\n\nAnother Instagram post, also shared Nov. 19, showed the same video clips of Pelosi and made a similar claim that the Capitol attack was a setup. These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\nAlthough the video clips in the Instagram posts appear to have the same audio recording, a full video of the Congress members’ phone call with Pence shows that’s not so.\n\nA short clip of the conversation with Pence was released Oct. 13, 2022, by the House select committee on the Jan. 6 attack. CNN obtained and published a longer video of that conversation the same day. Both videos were filmed by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and Nancy Pelosi’s daughter.\n\nIn the full video, Nancy Pelosi holds the cellphone beside Schumer as Pence says the Capitol Police chief believes the House and Senate will be able to reconvene in an hour. Pence later says he will call Schumer, unless Schumer is present, and Pelosi hands the phone to Schumer.\n\nAt this point, about a minute and a half later, Grassley walks up to Pelosi and Schumer and listens to Pence relay the same information about when Congress can reconvene. But the audio from earlier in the clip is not repeated, as it is in the Instagram posts.\n\nThis footage shows congressional leaders coordinating with the vice president to resume certifying the 2020 election after rioters stormed the Capitol. It does not prove that the events of Jan. 6, 2021, were scripted or part of a movie.\n\nIn the nearly three years since the Capitol attack, PolitiFact has fact-checked numerous false claims about the attack and found no evidence that it was contrived. Falsehoods about the attack were named PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year. It was a real event with real consequences.\n\nHundreds of people, fueled partly by the false belief that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen, stormed the Capitol as Congress was certifying the election results. The rioters, many armed and clad in Trump-branded apparel and combat gear, scaled walls, broke windows, forced their way into the building and repeatedly clashed with police.\n\nOne woman was fatally shot by police during the attack. And five police officers who served at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, died soon after, The New York Times reported.\n\nIn February 2021, the cost of the attack, including repairs, enhanced security and increased mental health services, was estimated to exceed $30 million, The New York Times reported.\n\nSince the attack, more than 1,100 people have been charged with federal crimes, including obstruction of Congress, use of a deadly or dangerous weapon, and causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Of those, 714 have pleaded guilty and 709 have been sentenced, according to an NPR analysis.\n\nWe rate the claim that videos of Nancy Pelosi from Jan. 6, 2021, show the Capitol attack was staged False.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/video-nancy-pelosi-january-6-trump-pelosis-power-documentary/', 'Headline': 'How Nancy Pelosi Responded as Jan. 6 and Its Aftermath Unfolded - PBS', 'Snippet': 'As the U.S. continues to navigate fallout from Jan. 6, and as questions swirl about whether Democrats and Pelosi will maintain control of the House in the 2022 midterms, Pelosi’s Power offers an ...', 'Full_text': 'On Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election, Nancy Pelosi was among their targets.\n\nIn scenes from Pelosi’s Power, the first documentary on the life and legacy of the first woman speaker of the House, rioters chant Pelosi’s name as they move through the Capitol building. Footage captures them shouting, “Where are you, Nancy? We’re looking for you,” and “Yeah, we’re coming, bitch,” before entering her office.\n\nSusan Page, author of the Pelosi biography Madam Speaker, later asked Pelosi if she’d been afraid.\n\n“Nancy said that they would’ve had a fight on their hands. They would’ve had a battle on their hands, because she’s a street fighter,” Page tells FRONTLINE in the opening moments of Pelosi’s Power, embedded above. “And then she lifts up her foot. And, you know, she always wears those 4-inch stiletto heels. And she points at her shoe and says, ‘Besides, I could’ve used these as weapons.’”\n\nIn the hours and days to come, Pelosi would fight — not against the rioters but against the leader who had fueled the insurrection through false claims about a stolen election.\n\n“She really saw [then-President Donald Trump] as so reckless and dangerous,” says Molly Ball, author of Pelosi and a reporter on the new FRONTLINE documentary. “It was such a white-knuckle moment that, whatever the rules said, you just had to hold down the fort and make sure that things didn’t get further out of hand.”\n\nOn Jan. 7, as the above excerpt recounts, Pelosi called the Pentagon’s top general, Mark Milley, and asked about safeguards to prevent “an unstable president” from initiating any rash actions. Then Pelosi went to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and with him called Vice President Mike Pence, another target of the mob, to ask Pence to invoke the 25th amendment. When Pence didn’t take the call, Pelosi moved toward impeachment.\n\n“There was a total void of leadership in our country at that moment,” Judy Lemons, Pelosi’s chief of staff from 1987 to 2002, says in the above excerpt. “Nancy Pelosi was the one leading the country in that moment. She had to be the one dealing with this crisis. And that’s what she did.”\n\n“She found herself in a singular position of power, with a singular responsibility, at this crucial and dangerous moment, and that was not an accident,” Washington Post columnist Matt Bai says at the end of the clip. “That was a long time coming.”\n\nPelosi’s Power, premiering Tuesday, March 22 at 9/8c on PBS, is the first documentary to explore Pelosi’s journey from her 1987 election as a freshman representative (D-Calif.) to the highest-ranking member of the U.S. House of Representatives. The 90-minute film draws on dozens of in-depth interviews: with Pelosi herself; with her family; with her staffers, Congressional colleagues and fierce opponents; with White House insiders; and with journalists and biographers who have chronicled the career of the woman who is now second in line to the presidency.\n\nWhat emerges is a vivid portrait of one of America’s most powerful and polarizing political figures.\n\n“She’s a no-holds-barred politician that was about partisan warfare 100% of the time,” former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) says in the film.\n\nSays Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post, “Nancy Pelosi has never been accused of bringing a knife to a gunfight.”\n\nThe documentary traces Pelosi’s approach to wielding power back to her childhood in Baltimore, where her father was mayor and a U.S. representative. It explores how Pelosi navigated what Lemons calls “entrenched paternalism and crude sexism” after being elected to Congress in 1987 as one of only 23 women in the 435-person chamber. And it investigates her ascent to the speakership as she fought for policies in support of her self-described lifelong ambition: creating a better future for “the children.”\n\n“Nancy Pelosi came up in a historical era where you increasingly did see politics as combat,” Ball says in the documentary. “So she always said, ‘Every morning, I put on a suit of armor, eat nails for breakfast, and go out and do battle.’”\n\nIncluding, as the documentary shows, with Donald Trump.\n\nAs the U.S. continues to navigate fallout from Jan. 6, and as questions swirl about whether Democrats and Pelosi will maintain control of the House in the 2022 midterms, Pelosi’s Power offers an illuminating window into the speaker: who she is, what drives her and why she believes democracy itself is at stake.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/politics/miller-analysis-january-6-secret-service/index.html', 'Headline': 'With renewed finger pointing around January 6, was there a failure of ...', 'Snippet': 'The most on-point paper from the days before January 6 may the threat assessment produced by the US Capitol Police intelligence arm on January 3 – three days before the storming of the Capitol.', 'Full_text': 'The documents the Secret Service provided to the congressional investigators that CNN has obtained exclusively tell us a lot about what law enforcement knew and when they knew it leading up to January 6.\n\nThere is a habit in post-9/11 Washington, especially among politicians, to call out any failure to predict the future as an “intelligence failure.” That allows elected officials to put the feet of the people on the front lines of intelligence gathering to the fire.\n\nBut the Secret Service documents obtained by CNN tell us there was plenty of intelligence coming in just before January 6 regarding the potential for violence.\n\nThe documents tell us that federal law enforcement agencies were meeting regularly in the days leading up to January 6 and that intelligence was moving between agencies. The Secret Service documents indicate a summary of reporting from the FBI based on coordination briefings that occurred every two hours between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on the night before the protest that would become an insurrection.\n\nOne summary of FBI intelligence from January 5 reads: “Right wing groups responding from across the nation and establishing ‘quick reaction forces’ in Virginia. Standing by at the ready should POTUS request assistance.”\n\nThe summary indicated that the FBI was tracking 52 threat reports coming in from field offices across the country.\n\nThere was also information provided to the Secret Service by the US Marshals Service from a post from 9 a.m. on January 6 on Parler, the online social site which is popular with conservatives: “Now you got weapons I came packing got my dc carry permit in November,” writes a Trump supporter. “I’m here for justice bang bang. F—k Pence sellout traitor we better see him coming out that building in handcuffs or were going in.”\n\nAnother post two days earlier in the same app predicts, “It’s gonna get violent as we charge the federal buildings and drag out corrupt politicians dead or alive!”\n\nAt the time of the January 6 assault on the Capitol, I was the deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism at the New York Police Department. My intelligence analysts also shared information we gathered with the US Capitol Police and the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police. Now the Secret Service finds itself in the crosshairs of congressional critics about whether the Secret Service shared information with other agencies.\n\nThe question shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how intelligence flows between agencies. The two organizations that are supposed to share information widely with law enforcement partners are the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe documents the Secret Service shared with the January 6 committee show most of the intelligence was coming from the FBI. Much of that was being passed in briefings at the FBI’s Washington field office to all agencies involved in preparing for the January 6 protests. Critics have also pointed to a December 31, 2020, Secret Service summary of Facebook posts promoting pro-Trump protests on January 6 with each paragraph ending with “there is no indication of civil disobedience.”\n\nCritics claimed that shows the Secret Service was downplaying the potential for violence. As an intelligence professional who read similar summaries for nearly two decades, I can tell you that caveat simply meant this: There is simply no indications in the Facebook posting of planned violence.\n\nTo underscore that point, the same document went to great pains on its first page to point out that prior demonstrations by some of the same groups in Washington just weeks earlier had resulted in “physical altercations between pro and anti-Trump demonstration groups as well as numerous arrests” including for assault, assault on a police officer, possession of a weapon and inciting violence.\n\nThe most on-point paper from the days before January 6 may the threat assessment produced by the US Capitol Police intelligence arm on January 3 – three days before the storming of the Capitol.\n\nThe document was written by a team of Capitol Police intelligence analysts working for Jack Donohue, an expert on politically motivated violent extremism. Prior to joining the Capitol Police, Donohue had been one of my deputies in the NYPD.\n\nThis is what his January 3 memo concluded: “Supporters of the current president see January 6, 2021 as the last opportunity to overturn the results of the presidential election. This sense of desperation and disappointment may lead to more of an incentive to become violent.” Another key judgment on that page: “Unlike previous post-election protests, the targets of the pro-Trump supporters are not necessarily the counter-protesters…but rather Congress itself.”\n\nThe analysis ends with these words: “this, combined with Stop the Steal’s propensity to attract white supremacists, militia members and others who actively promote violence, may lead to a significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike.” That was Sunday, January 3 at 3 p.m.\n\nSo, where is the intelligence failure? If the intel was on target, and the information was being shared, how did the events of January 6 unfold the way they did?\n\nOne of the key questions after the assault on the Capitol by thousands of protesters was, where was the National Guard?\n\nA day after Capitol Police Chief Steve Sund read Donohue’s Intelligence analysis, according to his testimony in the Senate, “I approached the two Sergeants at Arms to request the assistance of the National Guard, as I had no authority to do so without an Emergency Declaration by the Capitol Police Board.”\n\nSund testified that he asked the House of Representatives Sergeant-at-Arms, Paul Irving, to ask for National Guard troops for January 6. According to Sund’s testimony, Irving, who effectively reported to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said “he was concerned about the ‘optics’ of having National Guard present and didn’t feel that the intelligence supported it.” Irving denied Sund’s account in his written testimony,\n\n“Certain media reports have stated that ‘optics’ determined my judgment about using those National Guard troops. That is categorically false. ‘Optics’ as portrayed in the media did not determine our security posture; safety was always paramount when evaluating security for January 6.”\n\nSund, at Irving’s suggestion, then tried the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger who reported to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nAccording to Sund, Stenger also would not approve the request but “suggested I ask them how quickly we could get support if needed and to ‘lean forward’ in case we had to request assistance on January 6.” When Sund called National Guard Gen. William Walker on the days leading up to January 6, he asked if Walker would be able to get troops on the ground if needed. Walker told Sund yes, but needed the formal approvals to mobilize.\n\nBoth sergeants-at-arms testified in March that they never brought the January 3 request from the chief of the Capitol to either Pelosi or McConnell until the Capitol was fully under siege on January 6. Irving said, “The intelligence was not that there would be a coordinated attack on the Capitol, nor was it contemplated in any of the interagency meetings I attended before the attack.” Stenger died of cancer in June.\n\nAnother thing that might have changed analytic judgments and even police deployments would have been advance word from the White House that President Donald Trump was going to give a speech to a large crowd of supporters outside on the Ellipse and tell them they had to “fight like hell” to save the country as they prepared to march to the Capitol. That didn’t enter the threat stream until it actually happened.\n\nIn the end, both sergeants-at-arms and the Capitol Police chief had to fall on their swords. In March, Congress called for a review of how critical operational decisions are made by the Capitol Police. Congress passed legislation giving the chief of the Capitol Police the authority to ask for emergency assistance from the DC National Guard and other federal agencies without having to go through the Capitol Police Board.\n\nThe swift passage of the new legislation shows us that even elected officials who routinely work by committee, understood that their police chief shouldn’t have to run a crisis through one.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/politics/jan-6-report-senate.html', 'Headline': 'Senate Report Details Jan. 6 Intelligence and Law Enforcement Failures ...', 'Snippet': 'A 106-page report released by the Senate Homeland Security Committee’s staff highlights and adds to evidence already uncovered by the news media and the now-defunct House Jan. 6 committee.', 'Full_text': 'Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday released a scathing report that detailed how the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies repeatedly ignored, downplayed or failed to share warnings of violence before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe 106-page report, entitled “Planned in Plain Sight,” highlighted and added to evidence already uncovered by the now-defunct House Jan. 6 committee, news reporting and other congressional work to provide the most comprehensive picture to date of a cascading set of security and intelligence failures that culminated in the deadliest assault on the Capitol in centuries.\n\nAides said Senate staff obtained thousands of additional documents from federal law enforcement agencies, including the Justice Department, before drafting the report. It includes multiple calls for armed violence, calls to occupy federal buildings including the Capitol and some of the clearest threats the F.B.I. received but did little about — including a warning that the far-right group the Proud Boys was planning to kill people in Washington.\n\n“Our intelligence agencies completely dropped the ball,” said Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan and the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. He added: “Despite a multitude of tips and other intelligence warnings of violence on Jan. 6, the report showed that these agencies repeatedly — repeatedly — downplayed the threat level and failed to share the intelligence they had with law enforcement partners.”\n\nThe report determined the F.B.I.’s monitoring of social media threats was “degraded mere days before the attack,” because the bureau changed contracts for third-party social media monitoring. The committee obtained internal emails showing that F.B.I. officials were “surprised” by the timing of the contract change and “lamented the negative effect it would have on their monitoring capabilities in the lead-up to Jan. 6.”\n\nBut the investigation made clear that monitoring was not the only issue. It faulted the F.B.I. for failing to act on an array of dire warnings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

He also took the Fifth when asked basic questions like his age.\n\nStone did not reveal who paid for his private flight from Florida to Washington, DC, in the days before Jan. 6, or who paid for his hotel room at the Willard InterContinental, which is where Stone and other Trump allies set a “war room” on Jan. 6. He also would not confirm which events he was invited to speak at on Jan. 5 and 6, by whom, or if he even attended them at all.\n\nHe was previously convicted of lying to Congress during its investigation into Russian meddling in 2016. Prosecutors argued that he lied to protect then-President Donald Trump, who pardoned him in 2020, before leaving office.\n\nThrough its questioning, the select committee investigators delved into how the Oath Keepers coordinated to protect Stone when he was in Washington, DC, on Jan. 5 and 6, 2021. A group chat through the encrypted messaging app Signal included Stone and Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes, who has been convicted of seditious conspiracy. Stone wrote, “this group is for all event organizers and VIP speakers who need Oath Keepers PSD or event security on Jan 5/6 so they can talk to me and my top OK team leaders all in one place.” Rhodes later messaged that Kelly Meggs from Florida would be Stone’s protection.\n\nThe select committee asked about text exchanges between Stone and “Stop the Steal” rally organizer Ali Alexander, who also was interviewed by the panel, from Jan. 6 where the pair discuss logistics about the rallies that day.\n\n“As I expected, no speaking spot, no VIP entrance for any of my people” Stone said to Alexander at approximately 10:02 a.m. A few hours later, Alexander wrote to stone, “get your ass to the US Capitol” and added “we have a stage & the presidents order.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s one-time national security adviser, Michael Flynn, asserted his Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination to nearly every question asked by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection during his interview with the panel, the transcript of his testimony released Wednesday confirms.\n\nFlynn answered a series of initial questions about his background and military career, acknowledging for example that he joined a group called “The America Project,” which was founded by former Overstock CEO and known election denier Patrick Byrne.\n\nHe also answered when the committee asked if he knew the reason Trump pardoned him.\n\n“Because I think he saw my whole case as a travesty of justice,” Flynn said.\n\nBut when asked why he failed to produce any documents pursuant to the committee’s subpoena, Flynn invoked the Fifth Amendment, ultimately doing so for every other question during the course of his March deposition.\n\nFlynn’s lawyer noted during the interview that his client was appearing before the committee while a lawsuit to quash the panel’s subpoena was still pending.\n\nAmong the questions Flynn responded to by invoking his Fifth Amendment protections, were about his communications with Trump, White House staff, officials at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, officials at the Department of Justice and attorneys representing the former president about election fraud or other irregularities.\n\nMore background: CNN has previously reported that Flynn played a central role in not only spreading baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud and pushed US officials to investigate claims about foreign manipulation of voting machines.\n\nDuring an Oval Office meeting with Trump in mid-December 2020, Flynn also proposed using the federal government to seize voting machines, sources previously told CNN.\n\nHouse Republicans released a report Wednesday focused on security failures at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, highlighting well-documented breakdowns in intelligence sharing, Capitol security and coordination between various law enforcement agencies that responded that day.\n\nTheir primary recommendation centers around reforming the Capitol Police Board and bolstering congressional oversight of the Capitol police force – two issues that were identified by lawmakers of both parties in the wake of Jan. 6.\n\nBut the GOP report is silent on other efforts to disrupt the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election and selective in its criticism of political leaders and their culpability in the security breakdowns on Jan. 6. The report resurfaces largely unfounded allegations to cast blame on Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while glossing over former President Donald Trump’s own role.\n\nRepublicans cast the report as a rebuttal to the House select committee’s investigation into Jan. 6 as they are set to take control of the chamber and endeavor to take back the narrative. Republican lawmakers have said the security failures are paramount and that the select committee overstepped its mandate in its 17-month probe.\n\nThe Democrat-led select committee had planned to release its final report on Wednesday but has delayed the rollout until Thursday. An executive summary released on Monday lays blame for the insurrection squarely on Trump.\n\nMore on the report: The GOP report comes from the five Republicans who Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy initially appointed to serve on the select committee before deciding members of his party would not participate.\n\nIt includes a timeline of events that occurred on Jan. 6, making no mention of the fact that Trump waited hours before calling on the rioters to leave the US Capitol that day and omitting incendiary remarks he made at the rally preceding the attack.\n\nInstead, the report paints Trump as only encouraging his supporters at the White House Ellipse to march to the US Capitol and demonstrate “peacefully,” noticeably omitting other parts of the speech, including when he encouraged rally goers to “fight light hell.”\n\nSimilarly, the timeline includes a tweet Trump sent after the Capitol had been breached, saying: “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”\n\nMissing from the report is Trump’s tweet in which he eventually told the rioters to leave the Capitol – several hours after the deadly riot began.\n\nThe select committee has revealed witness testimony from several former White House officials saying Trump repeatedly refused to call off the rioters despite being asked to do so by a number of his closest advisers.\n\nThe GOP report also doesn’t address Trump’s claim that he issued a directive prior to Jan. 6 to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to the Capitol that day.\n\nTrump’s former Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, in an interview with the select committee, denied Trump gave him formal orders authorizing the deployment of National Guard troops to the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report expected to be released Wednesday.\n\nThe committee is made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks.

Adam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nThe final report the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack is set to release Wednesday launches a new era for criminal investigators, politicians, and members of the public who have been eager to see the nuts and bolts of its work.\n\nHere’s what to watch for:\n\nDetail on possible obstruction of the investigation\n\nIn the summary of its report released earlier this week, the panel revealed it is aware of “multiple efforts by President Donald Trump to contact Select Committee witnesses,” adding that DOJ is aware “of at least one of those circumstances.”\n\nThe summary released Monday also claimed the panel has a “range of evidence suggesting specific efforts to obstruct the Committee’s investigation.” That includes concerns that attorneys paid by Trump’s political committee or allied groups “have specific incentives to defend President Trump rather than zealously represent their own clients.”\n\nDetails of Trump’s effort to visit the Capitol\n\nThe summary details that the panel was ultimately unable to get former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato to corroborate a bombshell moment during the public hearings, in which Hutchinson recalled Ornato describing Trump’s altercation with the head of his security detail when he was told he would not be taken to the Capitol following his speech on the Ellipse.\n\nThe committee summary said both Hutchinson and a White House employee testified to the panel about the Ornato conversation. But “Ornato professed that he did not recall either communication, and that he had no knowledge at all about the President’s anger.”\n\nThe committee wrote that it “has significant concerns about the credibility of this testimony” and vowed to release his transcript publicly.\n\nFundraising efforts\n\nIn terms of financing after the 2020 presidential election and through the Jan. 6 rallies, the committee says it gathered evidence indicating that Trump “raised roughly one quarter of a billion dollars in fundraising efforts between the election and January 6th.”\n\n“Those solicitations persistently claimed and referred to election fraud that did not exist,” the panel wrote.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, has said the panel has evidence that members of the Trump family and inner circle – including Kimberly Guilfoyle – personally benefited from money that was raised based on the former president’s false election claims, but the panel has never gone as far to say a financial crime has been committed.\n\nRead more on what to watch for here.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee made a startling allegation on Monday, claiming it had evidence that a Trump-backed attorney urged a key witness to mislead the committee about details they recalled. In the executive summary of the final report, the committee revisited the issue in its handoff of the investigation to the Justice Department.\n\nAccording to the report, “the lawyer had advised the witness that the witness could, in certain circumstances, tell the Committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them.” The committee declined to identify the people.\n\nWhat we know: However, CNN has learned that Stefan Passantino, the top ethics attorney in the Trump White House, is the lawyer who allegedly advised his then-client, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, to tell the committee that she did not recall details that she did, sources familiar with the committee’s work tell CNN. Before her public testimony, Hutchinson dropped Passantino and got a new lawyer.\n\nTrump’s Save America political action committee funded Passantino and his law firm Elections LLC, including paying for his representation of Hutchinson, other sources tell CNN. The committee report notes the lawyer did not tell his client who was paying for the legal services.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Passantino said he didn’t advise Hutchinson to mislead the committee. “I represented Ms. Hutchinson honorably, ethically, and fully consistent with her sole interests as she communicated them to me. I believed Ms. Hutchinson was being truthful and cooperative with the Committee throughout the several interview sessions in which I represented her.”\n\nPassantino pointed out it’s not uncommon for people to change lawyers “because their interests or strategies change,” according to his statement. He also said political committees sometimes cover client fees “at the client’s request.”\n\nBy Tuesday, Passantino’s professional biography had been removed from the website of a midwestern-based law firm where he was a partner – and he acknowledged in his statement he was on a leave of absence from the firm “given the distraction of this matter.” He remains a partner at Elections LLC.\n\nLawyers must follow extensive ethics guidelines as part of their profession, including avoiding conflicts of interest that could compromise their representation of a client. According to legal ethics experts, a lawyer swaying their client’s testimony in a way that wouldn’t be entirely truthful could be looked at as possible obstruction of an investigation.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has started handing over evidence — documents and transcripts — to the Justice Department in the last week, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith had sent a letter to the committee on Dec. 5, requesting all of the information from the panel’s investigation, another source told CNN.\n\nThe information transfer focuses specifically on former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s former election lawyer John Eastman, the source added. The DOJ also received Meadows text messages from the committee.\n\nThe panel also has started to share transcripts of witness interviews pertaining to the false slates of electors and the pressure campaign by the former president and his allies on certain states to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\n“We’ve actually given some transcripts to the Department of Justice during the last month,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the select committee, told CNN Monday.\n\nThe committee also is slated to release its full final report today.\n\nSpokespersons for the committee and for the special counsel did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nThe final report from the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, will include information about Republican National Committee fundraising directly after the 2020 presidential election, what Secret Service knew ahead of the attack and the response by the National Guard, committee member Rep. Pete Aguilar said earlier this month.\n\nThe comments from Aguilar expand on themes the committee has presented in its previous hearings and detail to a new level what is expected to appear in the final report. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, has previously told CNN the panel’s final report will contain eight chapters.\n\nSome information in the report will be redacted due to security concerns, according to Aguilar.\n\nHe added that “there have been some conversations with people who came before us, where we indicated we would redact some small pieces,” such as current workplaces, that are important to protect.\n\nWith its mic drop finale, the House committee investigating the US Capitol insurrection left a fateful question hanging over Washington, Donald Trump and the 2024 presidential campaign: will the ex-president be charged with a crime?\n\nThe committee announced in its final public meeting on Monday it was recommending to the Justice Department that Trump be prosecuted on at least four charges, carefully matching the panel’s catalog of violence, lies, insurrection and dereliction of duty up to and on January 6, 2021, with specific legal statutes.\n\nYet the panel, despite delivering what it called a “roadmap to justice,” has no power to try Trump and its decisions are not binding on the Justice Department.\n\nThe DOJ has its own investigation and faces prosecutorial decisions that require a higher bar than the committee’s political gambits. The potential charges concerned also have little case law precedent.\n\nAnd while both Attorney General Merrick Garland and the House committee have long argued that every American should be subject to equal justice, the gravity of indicting an ex-president and current White House candidate who has already used violence as a political tool means the department’s dilemma is among the most fateful in American history.\n\nMore broadly, the committee has now sketched the most urgent framing of a perennial question about Trump’s riotous careers in business and politics: Will he ever face accountability for his rule-breaking conduct?\n\nThe question is especially acute given that the norm crushed this time almost toppled US democracy.\n\nRead the full analysis here.\n\nFor months, the Jan. 6 committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. On Monday, the committee didn’t equivocate.\n\nThe committee referred Trump to the DOJ on at least four criminal charges, including:\n\nObstructing an official proceeding\n\nDefrauding the United States\n\nMaking false statements\n\nAssisting or aiding an insurrection\n\nThe panel said in its executive summary that it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nSo what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nIn practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nBut the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department’s court.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said during Monday’s meeting that he has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nAfter the panel’s meeting, Thompson told CNN that the evidence that supports the panel’s decision to refer Trump to the DOJ is “clear,” adding that he is “convinced” that the department will ultimately charge Trump.\n\nCNN’s Tierney Sneed contributed reporting to this post.\n\nOn Monday, the January 6 committee released an executive summary of its report, and it plans to release the full report on Wednesday, as well as transcripts of committee interviews.\n\nHere are takeaways from the committee’s final public meeting:\n\nCommittee refers Trump to DOJ. The committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nAll roads lead to Trump. Committee members repeatedly pointed to Trump’s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on January 6. Monday’s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break “the foundation of American democracy.”\n\nCommittee uses video to illustrate case. The committee showed a video montage laying out all of its allegations against Trump, from witnesses saying that Trump was told he lost the election by his aides to the former president’s failure to act on January 6 as the violence at the Capitol was unfolding. The montage went step-by-step through Trump’s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters.\n\nA bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois described how his House GOP colleagues were complicit in Trump’s efforts to overturn the election. He highlighted evidence that Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to “put the facade of legitimacy” on his voter fraud claims so “Republican congressmen … can distort and destroy and create doubt” about the 2020 election results.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has concluded that former President Donald Trump was ultimately responsible for the insurrection, laying out for the public and the Justice Department a trove of evidence for why he should be prosecuted for multiple crimes.\n\nThe summary describes in extensive detail how Trump tried to overpower, pressure and cajole anyone who wasn’t willing to help him overturn his election defeat — while knowing that many of his schemes were unlawful. His relentless arm-twisting included election administrators in key states, senior Justice Department leaders, state lawmakers, and others. The report even suggests possible witness tampering with the committee’s investigation.\n\nThe full report, based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation by the nine-member bipartisan committee, will be released Wednesday, along with along with transcripts and other materials collected in the investigation.\n\nHere are some key things from the report summary:\n\nCommittee referring Trump and others to DOJ: The House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Trump attorney John Eastman and “others.” The report summary says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nTrump’s false victory was “premeditated”: The committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\nTrump’s belief that the election is stolen is no excuse, lawmakers say: Sources familiar with Trump’s legal strategy in the Justice Department probe have told CNN that his attorneys believe prosecutors face an uphill battle in proving he did not believe the election was stolen despite being told as much by senior members of his own administration.\n\nIn making its case for a Justice Department prosecution of Trump, the House committee took aim at that possible defense.\n\nSeveral members of Congress being referred to House Ethics Committee: The select committee is referring several Republican lawmakers who refused to cooperate with the investigation to the House Ethics Committee. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona, could all face possible sanctions for their refusal to comply with committee subpoenas.\n\nTrump and others may try this again, committee warns: The summary’s section outlining the referrals makes a case for why the Justice Department’s prosecutions should extend beyond the rioters who physically breached the Capitol.\n\nThe committee says that Trump “believed then, and continues to believe now, that he is above the law, not bound by our Constitution and its explicit checks on Presidential authority.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-01-05/pelosi-mccarthy-timeline-jan-6', 'Headline': 'January 6: Nancy Pelosi, Kevin McCarthy on the investigation - Los ...', 'Snippet': 'Immediately after the Jan. 6 attack, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy seemed united.

The Californians hinted that the trauma of the day could help bridge the partisan divide in Congress. They even agreed that President Trump — through actions or inaction — bore significant responsibility for the Capitol riot.\n\nBut over the last year, a chasm has grown between the two leaders over how to move forward from the attack and how to hold those responsible accountable. It is a divide that reflects a larger split in America, as more people inside and outside of Washington seek to write and rewrite the history of last Jan. 6.\n\nThrough a second impeachment and the House select committee investigation, Pelosi (D-San Francisco) has focused on Trump, his allies and those who attempted to overturn the election results. McCarthy (R-Bakersfield), meanwhile, has sought to block the Democratic-led investigations and increasingly backed away from his early criticism of the former president, looking instead to shift the blame and connect the attack to broader civil unrest in the country.\n\nAs the congressional investigation searches for answers about why the Jan. 6 attack happened, most Republican lawmakers dismiss it as a partisan effort to reopen political wounds and smear their party.\n\nUnderlying it all is the lie the former president and his allies first began seeding in the months leading up to his loss in November 2020: that the election was illegitimate.\n\nBelow is a timeline of the nation’s yearlong journey, as told through the words of Pelosi and McCarthy.\n\nJan. 6, 12:17 p.m.\n\nPresident Trump holds a “Save America” rally at the Ellipse outside the White House, near the Washington Monument. He tells supporters he will join them in walking to the Capitol.\n\nTrump: “And after this, we’re going to walk down, and I’ll be there with you, we’re going to walk down … we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and -women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”\n\nJan. 6, 12:53 p.m.\n\nTrump supporters begin to attack the Capitol, breaking through barricades and windows and disrupting the certification of the presidential election results. Pelosi issues a statement urging Trump to help end the attack, while McCarthy calls Trump directly.\n\nMcCarthy: “I condemn any of this. This is appalling. This is un-American. This should never happen in our nation, and whatever is going on right now needs to stop. … They broke windows, they overran the building. We had to stop our proceedings in the middle of it. As a nation I know we sit back and we’re appalled by what we’re seeing. But I want everybody to take a deep breath and understand that we all have some responsibility here.”\n\nJan. 6, 4:17 p.m.\n\nFollowing calls from McCarthy, White House aides and conservative media hosts urging Trump to act, the president releases a video on Twitter telling his followers to go home. In the tweet, he reiterates false claims that the election was stolen. “I know how you feel,” he tells his followers rioting at the Capitol. “We love you, you’re very special ... go home in peace.” Within days the president will be banned or suspended from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.\n\nJan. 6, 8:06 p.m.\n\nCongress reconvenes to complete the counting of electoral votes.\n\nPelosi: “Our purpose will be accomplished. We must and we will show to the country, and indeed to the world, that we will not be diverted from our duty, that we will respect our responsibility to the Constitution and to the American people.”\n\nMcCarthy: “We will not falter, we will not bend and we will not shrink from our duty. Let me be very clear: Mobs don’t rule America; laws rule America. It was true when our cities were burning this summer, and it’s true now.”\n\nJan. 7\n\nDemocratic leaders urge Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare the president unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\n\nPelosi: “In calling for this seditious act, the president has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people. I joined the Senate Democratic leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th Amendment. If the vice president and Cabinet do not act, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment.”\n\nJan. 13\n\nThe House votes 232 to 197 to impeach President Trump for the second time, one day after passing a resolution calling on Pence to mobilize the Cabinet to activate the 25th Amendment. McCarthy calls for a censure instead.\n\nPelosi: “Our country is divided. We all know that. There are lies abroad in the land, spread by a desperate president who feels his power slipping away. We know that too. But I know this as well, that we here in this House have a sacred obligation to stand for truth, to stand up for the Constitution, to stand as guardians of the republic.”\n\nMcCarthy: “Some say the riots were cause by antifa. There’s absolutely no evidence of that, and conservatives should be the first to say it. ... Most Americans want neither inaction nor retribution. They want durable, bipartisan justice. That path is still available, but it is not the path we are on today. That doesn’t mean the president is free from fault. The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.”\n\nJan. 21\n\nDuring back-to-back news conferences, reporters ask McCarthy if President Trump “provoked” rioters to go to the Capitol, and ask Pelosi if impeachment would undercut unity.\n\nMcCarthy: “I don’t believe he provoked if you listened to what he said at the rally.”\n\nPelosi: “The fact is, the president of the United States committed an act of incitement of insurrection. I don’t think it’s very unifying to say, ‘Oh, let’s just forget it and move on.’ That’s not how you unify. Joe Biden said it beautifully: If you’re going to unite, you must remember.”\n\nJan. 28\n\nMcCarthy meets with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach while fundraising in Florida. Weeks later, he defends the meeting, saying: “I can talk to anyone.”\n\nMcCarthy: “Today, President Trump committed to helping elect Republicans in the House and Senate in 2022. ... A united conservative movement will strengthen the bonds of our citizens and uphold the freedoms our country was founded on.”\n\nFeb. 9\n\nThe impeachment trial of former President Trump begins in the Senate.\n\nFeb. 13\n\nThe Senate votes to acquit Trump, 57 to 43. Seven Republican senators vote with Democrats, but the chamber fails to reach the required two-thirds majority to convict.\n\nApril 25\n\nMcCarthy is asked about his Jan. 6 phone call with Trump during a Fox News interview. He defends Trump’s response on the day of the attack.\n\nMcCarthy: “I was the first person to contact him when the riot was going on. He didn’t see it. What he ended the call [with] was saying — telling me, he’ll put something out to make sure to stop this. And that’s what he did, he put a video out later.”\n\nMay 12\n\nAs McCarthy leaves a meeting with Pelosi and President Biden at the White House, he’s asked whether he has concerns about replacing Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming with Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York in the GOP leadership considering Stefanik has cast doubts on the election results.\n\nMcCarthy: “I don’t think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election. I think that is all over with. We’re sitting here with the president today.”\n\nMay 13\n\nPelosi: “Well, I don’t know on a normal day around here where people are threatening to hang the vice president of the United States or shoot the speaker in the forehead. ... The denial about what happened that day, denial for the need for more security to make sure it doesn’t happen again, and the denial of finding the truth is what we have to deal with.”\n\nMay 19\n\nThe House votes to form a 9/11-style independent commission to investigate the Capitol insurrection. McCarthy joins most Republicans in voting no, arguing that the commission should be free to investigate political violence more broadly and that other government groups are engaged in similar work. The commission dies in the Senate.\n\nMcCarthy: “Given the political misdirections that have marred this process, given the now duplicative and potentially counterproductive nature of this effort, and given the speaker’s shortsighted scope that does not examine interrelated forms of political violence in America, I cannot support this legislation.”\n\nPelosi: “In the interest of bipartisanship, we yielded on many points, which we thought would be important. … We wouldn’t budge on the purpose: to examine what happened on Jan. 6.”\n\nJune 23\n\nA day before Pelosi announces a House select committee to investigate Jan. 6, McCarthy again argues the scope of the investigation should be broader.\n\nMcCarthy: “I have real concern, though, especially the scope of where we’re going to go. … Just like in [the 9/11 independent commission], they didn’t just study what happened [on] 9/11, they studied what built up to it. So why wouldn’t we study what built up in the summer? Why wouldn’t we analyze and get to the bottom of why the National Guard were not here? Did things that happened in the summer prevent people from bringing the National Guard here earlier? Did the speaker make some comments in regard to that? I think those are the things that all should come forward.”\n\nJune 30\n\nThe House votes 222 to 190 to form a select committee to investigate the insurrection. Just two Republicans vote in favor.\n\nPelosi: “Every member here knows that Jan. 6 was an attempt to subvert our democracy, but many across the aisle refuse to admit the truth.... They refused to admit the truth when they called that day a ‘normal tourist visit.’ And today, when many will vote against establishing a select committee to investigate that day, they will again refuse to admit this truth.”\n\nJuly 21\n\nPelosi announces that she will block two of McCarthy’s appointees to the select committee, both staunch Trump allies who voted against certifying Biden’s election. McCarthy then pulls all of his nominees.\n\nPelosi: “With respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these members, I must reject the recommendations of Reps. [Jim] Banks [of Indiana] and [Jim] Jordan [of Ohio] to the select committee. The unprecedented nature of Jan. 6 demands this unprecedented decision.”\n\nMcCarthy: “This represents an egregious abuse of power and will irreparably damage this institution. … Unless Speaker Pelosi reverses course and seats all five Republican nominees, Republicans will not be party to their sham process and will instead pursue our own investigation of the facts.”\n\nJuly 27\n\nAs the House select committee holds its first hearing, McCarthy references the false claim that Pelosi blocked the National Guard from protecting the Capitol. As House speaker, Pelosi does not direct the the National Guard.\n\nMcCarthy: “There’s questions into the leadership within the structure of the speaker’s office, where they denied the ability to bring the National Guard here.”\n\nAug. 30\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee asks 35 telecommunications and social media companies to preserve phone records and other information relevant to its investigation. McCarthy warns telecommunications companies that comply with the order: “a Republican majority will not forget.”\n\nOct. 19\n\nTrump sues the Jan. 6 committee, arguing that his White House records are protected by executive privilege.\n\nOct. 21\n\nThe House votes 229 to 202 to hold Trump advisor Stephen K. Bannon, who helped promote the Jan. 6 rally before the insurrection, in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the select committee to testify about his role. Following a November indictment, Bannon is set to go on trial in July 2022.\n\nMcCarthy: “Issuing an invalid subpoena weakens our power, not if somebody votes against it. [Bannon] has the right to go to the court to see if he has executive privilege or not. I don’t know if he does or not, but neither does the committee. So they’re weakening the power of Congress itself by issuing invalid subpoena.”\n\nDec. 8\n\nPelosi is asked at a news conference about the breakdown of civility in the House.\n\nPelosi: “I’ll never forgive president — [the] former president of the United States and his lackeys and his bullies that he sent to the Capitol — for the trauma that was exerted on our staff. ... You cannot erase that.”\n\nDec. 23\n\nWith Trump’s effort to block the Jan. 6 committee’s request for his White House documents rejected by lower courts, he appeals to the Supreme Court.\n\nDec. 30\n\nPelosi sends a letter to her Democratic colleagues about the House’s plans to observe the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nPelosi: “The patriotism and courage of our Members as we prepare for this difficult day is an inspiration, for which I sincerely thank you.”\n\nJan. 2, 2022\n\nMcCarthy sends a letter to the House Republican caucus marking the start of 2022 and the anniversary of the Capitol attack.'}}",95.83333333333333,2

Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them.

Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/politics/biden-signs-gun-bill/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden signs bipartisan gun safety bill into law: ‘God willing, it’s ...', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious policy issues in Washington.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he finished signing the bill.\n\nThe legislation came together in the aftermath of recent mass shootings at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school and a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence-and-make-our-communities-safer/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: President Biden Announces New Actions to Reduce Gun ...', 'Snippet': 'President Biden is also encouraging the independent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers ...', 'Full_text': ""Today, in Monterey Park, California, President Biden will announce an Executive Order with the goal of increasing the number of background checks conducted before firearm sales, moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation. The Executive Order will also keep more guns out of dangerous hands by increasing the effective use of “red flag” laws, strengthen efforts to hold the gun industry accountable, and accelerate law enforcement efforts to identify and apprehend the shooters menacing our communities. President Biden is also encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors.\n\nPresident Biden is traveling to Monterey Park to grieve with the families and community impacted by the mass shooting that claimed 11 lives and injured nine others in January. Monterey Park is part of a growing list of communities all across the country that are forever changed due to gun violence—not only mass shootings, but also daily acts of gun violence that may not make national headlines.\n\nLast year, President Biden signed into the law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun violence reduction legislation enacted in nearly 30 years. When celebrating the Act’s passage, he called on Congress to seize the bipartisan momentum and advance additional commonsense steps to reduce gun violence. Again and again, he has called for Congress to act, including by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring background checks for all gun sales, requiring safe storage of firearms, closing the dating violence restraining order loophole, and repealing gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.\n\nAs he continues to call on Congress to act, President Biden will do everything he can to reduce gun violence and save lives. That is why, over the past two years, President Biden has taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other president at this point in their presidency.\n\nThe President’s new Executive Order to reduce gun violence includes the following additional actions, all of which fall within existing executive authority and outside of the right protected by the Second Amendment:\n\nKeeping guns out of dangerous hands\n\nThe Executive Order directs the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nIncrease the number of background checks by ensuring that all background checks required by law are conducted before firearm purchases, moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation. A large majority of Americans support background checks and agree it’s common sense to check whether someone is a felon or domestic abuser before allowing them to buy a gun. The President will continue to call on Congress to pass universal background check legislation. In the meantime, he is directing the Attorney General to do everything he can to ensure that firearms sellers who do not realize they are required to run background checks under existing law, or who are willfully violating existing law, become compliant with background check requirements. Specifically, the President is directing the Attorney General to move the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation by clarifying, as appropriate, the statutory definition of who is “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms, as updated by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This move would mean fewer guns will be sold without background checks, and therefore fewer guns will end up in the hands of felons and domestic abusers. The President is also directing the Attorney General to develop and implement a plan to prevent former federally licensed firearms dealers, whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered, from continuing to engage in the business of dealing in firearms.\n\nImprove public awareness and increase appropriate use of extreme risk protection (“red flag”) orders and safe storage of firearms. 19 states and the District of Columbia have enacted red flag laws, allowing trusted community members to petition a court to determine whether an individual is dangerous, and then to temporarily remove an individual’s access to firearms. However, these laws are only effective if the public knows when and how to use red flag orders. President Biden is directing members of his Cabinet to encourage effective use of extreme risk protection orders, including by partnering with law enforcement, health care providers, educators, and other community leaders. In addition, President Biden is directing members of his Cabinet to expand existing federal campaigns and other efforts to promote safe storage of firearms.\n\nAddress the loss or theft of firearms during shipping. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) data indicates an over 250% increase in the number of firearms reported as lost or stolen during shipment between federally licensed firearms dealers, from roughly 1,700 in 2018 to more than 6,100 in 2022. President Biden is directing the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Justice, to work to reduce the loss or theft of firearms during shipment and to improve reporting of such losses or thefts, including by engaging with carriers and shippers.\n\nHolding the gun industry accountable\n\nThe Executive Order directs the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nProvide the public and policymakers with more information regarding federally licensed firearms dealers who are violating the law. Gun dealers violating federal law put us all at risk by increasing the likelihood that firearms will fall into dangerous hands. The President is directing the Attorney General to publicly release, to the fullest extent permissible by law, ATF records from the inspection of firearms dealers cited for violation of federal firearm laws. This information will empower the public and policymakers to better understand the problem, and then improve our laws to hold rogue gun dealers accountable.\n\nUse the Department of Defense’s acquisition of firearms to further firearm and public safety practices. The Department of Defense buys a large number of firearms and other weapons to protect and serve our country. The President is directing the Secretary of Defense to develop and implement principles to further firearm and public safety practices through Department of Defense acquisition of firearms, consistent with applicable law.\n\nPresident Biden is also encouraging the independent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers market firearms to all civilians, including through the use of military imagery.\n\nAdditional steps to make our communities safer and support communities impacted by gun violence\n\nThe Executive Order will direct the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nHelp catch shooters by accelerating federal law enforcement’s reporting of ballistics data. The National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) allows federal, state, and local law enforcement to match fired cartridge casings to the guns from which they were fired, making it easier for law enforcement to connect multiple crime scenes and catch shooters. In order to maximize NIBIN’s effectiveness, federal, state, and local law enforcement all have an important role to play in ensuring timely submission of ballistics data to NIBIN. Today, the President is directing all federal law enforcement agencies to issue rigorous requirements regarding NIBIN data submission and use of this tool.\n\nAccelerate and intensify implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). BSCA is the most significant gun safety legislative accomplishment in nearly 30 years, and the Biden-Harris Administration is treating it as such by making the most of every opportunity it provides to reduce gun violence. President Biden is directing each agency responsible for the law’s implementation to send a report to him, within 60 days, on progress toward full implementation of BSCA and additional steps they will take to maximize the benefits of the law, including by increasing public awareness and use of the resources made available by BSCA.\n\nImprove federal support for gun violence survivors, victims and survivors’ families, first responders to gun violence, and communities affected by gun violence. When a hurricane overwhelms a community, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coordinates federal, state, local, and non-profit organizations in order to assess and meet community needs. However, when a mass shooting overwhelms a community, no coordinated U.S. government mechanism exists to meet short- and long-term needs, such as mental health care for grief and trauma, financial assistance (for example, when a family loses the sole breadwinner or when a small business is shut down due to a lengthy shooting investigation), and food (for example, when the Buffalo shooting closed down the only grocery store in the neighborhood). The President is directing members of his Cabinet to develop a proposal for how the federal government can better support communities after a mass shooting, and identify what additional resources or authorities the executive branch would need from Congress to implement this proposal.\n\nAdvance congressional efforts to prevent the proliferation of firearms undetectable by metal detectors. In recent years, we’ve seen the rise of technology that allows guns to be made with polymers and other materials that are increasingly capable of avoiding detection by metal detectors. President Biden is directing the Attorney General to help Congress modernize and make permanent the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988, which is currently set to expire in December 2023.\n\n###\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/03/14/executive-order-on-reducing-gun-violence-and-making-our-communities-safer/', 'Headline': 'Executive Order on Reducing Gun Violence and Making Our Communities', 'Snippet': 'By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows: Section 1.

Policy. Every few days in the United States, we mourn a new mass shooting. Daily acts of gun violence — including community violence, domestic violence, suicide, and accidental shootings — may not always make the evening news, but they too cut lives short and leave survivors and their communities with long-lasting physical and mental wounds. We cannot accept these facts as the enduring reality of life in America. Instead, we must together insist that we have had enough, and that we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation.\n\nIt is the policy of my Administration that executive departments and agencies (agencies) will pursue every legally available and appropriate action to reduce gun violence. Through this whole-of-government approach, my Administration has made historic progress to save lives. My Administration has taken action to keep guns out of dangerous hands and especially dangerous weapons off of our streets; hold gun traffickers and rogue gun dealers accountable; fund accountable, effective community policing; and invest in community violence interventions and prevention strategies.\n\nLast year, I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (the “Act”), the most significant bipartisan gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. The Act provides communities with new tools to combat gun violence, including enhanced gun background checks for individuals under age 21, funding for extreme risk protection orders and other crisis interventions, and increased mental health resources to help children impacted by gun violence heal from the resulting grief and trauma.\n\nI continue to call on the Congress to take additional action to reduce gun violence, including by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring background checks for all gun sales, requiring safe storage of firearms, funding my comprehensive Safer America Plan, and expanding community violence intervention and prevention strategies. In the meantime, my Administration will continue to do all that we can, within existing authority, to make our communities safer.\n\nSec. 2. Implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall each submit a report to the President within 60 days of the date of this order describing what actions their respective agencies have taken to implement the Act, data and analysis regarding the use and early effects of the Act, and additional steps their respective agencies will take to maximize the benefits of the Act. These reports shall include a plan for increasing public awareness and use of resources made available by the Act.\n\nSec. 3. Additional Agency Actions to Reduce Gun Violence. (a) The Attorney General shall develop and implement a plan to:\n\n(i) clarify the definition of who is engaged in the business of dealing in firearms, and thus required to become Federal firearms licensees (FFLs), in order to increase compliance with the Federal background check requirement for firearm sales, including by considering a rulemaking, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law;\n\n(ii) prevent former FFLs whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered from continuing to engage in the business of dealing in firearms;\n\n(iii) publicly release, to the fullest extent permissible by law, inspection reports of FFL dealers cited for violations of the law; and\n\n(iv) support efforts to modernize and make permanent the Undetectable Firearms Act (18 U.S.C. 922(p)).\n\n(b) The Secretary of Defense; the Attorney General; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; the Secretary of Education; and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall expand existing Federal campaigns and other efforts to promote safe storage of firearms.\n\n(c) The Secretary of Defense; the Attorney General; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; and the Secretary of Education shall undertake efforts to encourage effective use of extreme risk protection orders (“red flag” laws), partnering with law enforcement, health care providers, educators, and other community leaders.\n\n(d) The Attorney General; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; the Secretary of Education; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall develop a proposal for the President, and submit it no later than September 15, 2023, on how the Federal Government can better support the recovery, mental health, and other needs of survivors of gun violence, families of victims and survivors of gun violence, first responders to incidents of gun violence, and communities affected by gun violence. The proposal should draw on existing evidence, where available, and take into account how to address needs in both the immediate aftermath of mass shootings and in the years following such events. The proposal should recommend any additional executive branch coordination and additional resources or authorities from the Congress needed to implement the proposal, as well as how agencies will assess the outcomes for the activities implemented.\n\n(e) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop and implement principles to further firearm and public safety practices through the Department of Defense’s acquisition of firearms, consistent with applicable law.\n\n(f) The heads of Federal law enforcement agencies shall, as soon as practicable, but no later than 180 days from the date of this order, ensure that their respective law enforcement components issue National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) submission and utilization policies with requirements that are equivalent to, or exceed, the requirements of the policy issued by the Department of Justice on December 12, 2022, to ensure the prompt entry of ballistics data recovered in connection with criminal investigations into NIBIN. In consultation with the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense policies may be tailored to address specific operational considerations.\n\n(g) The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Justice, shall work to reduce the loss or theft of firearms during shipment between FFLs and to improve reporting of such losses or thefts, including by engaging with carriers and shippers.\n\n(h) The Federal Trade Commission is encouraged to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers market firearms to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.\n\nSec. 4. Definitions. For purposes of this order, the term “Federal law enforcement agency” means an organizational unit or subunit of the executive branch that employs officers who are authorized to make arrests and carry firearms, and that is responsible for the prevention, detection, and investigation of crime or the apprehension of alleged offenders. The term “heads of Federal law enforcement agencies” means the heads of those units or subunits.\n\nSec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nJOSEPH R.

Today, the President is celebrating the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun violence reduction legislation to pass Congress in 30 years.\n\nThe Biden Administration will continue to use all of the tools at its disposal to address the epidemic of gun violence. The President’s FY 2023 budget proposes $32 billion in additional funding to fight crime, including $20.6 billion in discretionary funding for federal law enforcement and state and local law enforcement and crime prevention programs, an increase of 11% over FY22 enacted ($18.6 billion) and 18% over FY21 enacted ($17.5 billion).\n\nBut there is so much more that can and must be done to save lives. The President will continue to urge Congress to take further legislative action to keep dangerous guns out of dangerous hands, including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, strengthening background checks, and enacting safe storage laws.\n\nBelow are 21 ways the Biden Administration has already used executive action to make our communities safer:\n\nKeeping Especially Dangerous Weapons and Repeat Shooters Off Our Streets\n\n1. The Justice Department issued a final rule to rein in the proliferation of ghost guns, which are unserialized, privately made firearms that are increasingly being recovered at crime scenes.\n\n2. The Attorney General directed every U.S. Attorney’s Office nationwide to increase resources dedicated to district specific violent crime strategies.\n\n3. The Justice Department issued a proposed rule to better regulate when devices marketed as firearm stabilizing braces effectively turn pistols into short-barreled rifles subject to the National Firearms Act.\n\nKeeping Guns Out of the Wrong Hands\n\n4. The Justice Department published model extreme risk protection order legislation to make it easier for states that want to adopt these red flag laws to do so.\n\n5. The Justice Department issued the first volume of its new, comprehensive report on firearms commerce and trafficking.\n\n6. The Justice Department announced a new policy to underscore zero tolerance for willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk.\n\n7. The Justice Department launched five new law enforcement strike forces focused on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Washington, D.C.\n\n8. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) launched a new paid media campaign featuring a series of public service announcements to reinforce the key message that a simple gun lock can save lives.\n\n9. The Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as the Office of Emergency Medical Services within the Department of Transportation (DOT), announced that they will jointly create a plan for addressing lethal means safety awareness, education, training, and program evaluation.\n\n10. ATF issued a final rule clarifying firearms dealers’ statutory obligations to make available for purchase compatible secure gun storage or safety devices.\n\nMaking Additional Progress to Reduce Community Violence\n\n11. The President called for cities and states to use American Rescue Plan funding to reduce gun crime and other violent crime, including by investing in community violence interventions and prevention. Through May 2022, $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funds had been committed to public safety and violence prevention – including at least $6.5 billion in State and Local funds committed by more than half of states and more than 300 communities across the country\n\n12. Five federal agencies made changes to 26 different programs to direct vital support to community violence intervention programs as quickly as possible. For example\n\n• The National Institutes of Health announced funding through its Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research grants for four community violence programs – including a place-based strategy involving repurposing vacant lots in Detroit, an evaluation of READI Chicago, a burnout prevention program for violence interrupters in Chicago, and a hospital-based violence intervention program focused on youth in Virginia.\n\n• The Justice Department announced $187 million for states and $85 million for localities through the Byrne JAG Program to support coordinated violence prevention and intervention; the Department explicitly encouraged the use of these funds for CVI.\n\n• The Department of Housing and Urban Development published a guide explaining to localities how Community Development Block Grants – a $3.4 billion annual funding stream –can be used to fund CVI strategies.\n\n• The Department of Education released a letter to state school associations on how 21st Century Learning Centers funds and Student Support and Academic enrichment programs – both billion-dollar formula grant funding streams – can be used to fund CVI strategies in schools.\n\n13. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services hosted a webinar and published information to educate states on how they can use Medicaid to reimburse certain community violence intervention programs, like Hospital-Based Violence Interventions. Last year, Connecticut and Illinois enacted legislation that allows Medicaid to reimburse providers for hospital-based violence prevention services – the first two states in the country to pursue this approach. According to reporting by USA Today, “[t]he idea has been in the works for years, advocates say, but not until the Biden administration signaled that states could – and should – use Medicaid dollars to support these violence prevention programs have state lawmakers stepped up.”\n\n14. Senior White House staff established The White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, a 16-jurisdiction cohort of mayors, law enforcement, CVI experts, and philanthropic leaders committed to using American Rescue Plan funding or other public funding to increase investment in their community violence intervention infrastructure.\n\nProviding Law Enforcement with the Tools and Resources They Need to Reduce Gun Violence\n\n15. The Justice Department announced $139 million in grants to local law enforcement that will put over 1,000 police officers on the beat through the COPS Office Hiring Program.\n\n16. The Justice Department’s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) expanded the Domestic Violence Homicide Prevention Firearms Technical Assistance Project (FTAP).\n\nAddressing the Root Causes of Gun Violence\n\n17. The Department of Labor awarded $89 million through its YouthBuild program to provide pre-apprenticeship opportunities for young people ages 16-24.\n\n18. The Department of Labor awarded $20 million through its Workforce Pathways for Youth program to expand workforce development activities that serve youth ages 14-21 during “out of school” time (non-school hours).\n\n19. The Department of Labor awarded $85.5 million to help formerly incarcerated adults and young people in 28 communities transition out of the criminal justice system and connect with quality jobs.\n\n20. The Department of Labor awarded $25.5 million in Young Adult Reentry Partnership grants to organizations that will help provide education and training services to young adults between 18-24 who were previously involved with the justice system or who left high school before graduation.\n\n21. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Family Violence Prevention and Services Program, awarded nearly $1 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) supplemental funding to support services for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and their children.\n\n###'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/us/politics/gun-control-bill-biden.html', 'Headline': 'Biden Signs Bipartisan Gun Bill Into Law - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'After 20 children were shot and killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, Mr. Biden, the vice president at the time, was tasked by President Barack Obama with drafting a list of executive actions on guns ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — President Biden on Saturday signed into law a bipartisan gun bill intended to prevent dangerous people from accessing firearms and increase investments in the nation’s mental health system, ending nearly three decades of gridlock in Washington over how to address gun violence in the United States.\n\nFinal passage of the legislation in Congress came one month after a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, left 19 children and two teachers dead, a horror that galvanized a bipartisan group of lawmakers to strike a narrow compromise.\n\n“God willing,” Mr. Biden said as he put his pen down on Saturday morning, “it’s going to save a lot of lives.”\n\nThe president acknowledged that the legislation fell far short of the sweeping measures he had pushed for, but he said it included some long-sought priorities.\n\n“When it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential,” Mr. Biden said.\n\nFor lawmakers, advocates and survivors of gun violence, the law is the culmination of decades of work, building on repeated failed efforts to overcome Republican opposition and overhaul the nation’s gun laws in response to mass shootings across the country.

We can’t fail the American people again.”\n\nMr. Biden’s speech came a day after a mass shooting in Tulsa, Okla., that killed four victims and nine days after a massacre in Uvalde, Texas, that took the lives of 19 elementary school children and two teachers. Ten days before that, 10 Black people were gunned down in a grocery store in Buffalo. The list, Mr. Biden said, goes on.\n\n“After Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Charleston, after Orlando, after Las Vegas, after Parkland — nothing has been done,” he said, lamenting decades of inaction.\n\nWith the 17-minute address, Mr. Biden abruptly shed the reluctance of his White House to engage in what could become yet another fruitless partisan confrontation, played out amid funerals in Uvalde, Buffalo and Tulsa. After weeks of carefully calibrating his calls for action, the president on Thursday did not hold back.\n\n“Enough, enough. It’s time for each of us to do our part,” he told Americans. “For the children we’ve lost. For the children we can save. For the nation we love.”\n\n“Let’s hear the call and the cry,” he said, almost pleading with his fellow politicians in Washington. “Let’s meet the moment. Let us finally do something.”\n\nWhether that will happen remains unclear. Despite his forceful tone, Mr. Biden all but acknowledged in his speech the political realities that could make him just another in a long line of presidents to have demanded action on guns, only to fail. He called the fight “hard,” and moments after urging a ban on assault weapons, he offered alternatives if that proved to be impossible.\n\n“If we can’t ban assault weapons, then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21, strengthen the background checks,” he said. He called on Congress to “enact safe storage law and red flag laws, repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers from liability, address the mental health crisis.”\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Biden turned his evident cynicism about Republicans into a kind of political threat, saying that “if Congress fails, I believe this time a majority of the American people won’t give up either. I believe the majority of you will act to turn your outrage into making this issue central to your vote.”\n\nMr. Biden is not a newcomer to the gun debate.\n\nHe has repeatedly said he favors reinstating the ban on assault weapons that he helped pass as a senator and was law for a decade before it expired in 2004. He has called on lawmakers to pass universal background checks for a decade, since 20 children were killed in a shooting in Newtown, Conn., in 2012.\n\nBut both of those measures are seen as highly unlikely to pass in Congress, where fierce Republican opposition has historically stood in their way. Lawmakers in both parties have said recently that they do not believe there is enough bipartisan support to approve either approach.\n\nHouse Democrats on Thursday advanced a wide-ranging package of gun control legislation that would prohibit the sale of semiautomatic rifles to people under 21 and ban the sale of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. But those measures, too, were all but certain to die in the Senate.\n\nDemocrats put forward the legislation in response to the killings in Uvalde and the racist massacre in Buffalo — both, the police say, at the hands of 18-year-old gunmen using legally purchased AR-15-style weapons.\n\nA bitterly divided House Judiciary Committee spent Thursday considering the legislation and approved it Thursday evening, on a party-line vote of 25 to 19. Fierce Republican opposition during the committee debate underscored the partisan animosity.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, warned that another shooting was not far away. He pleaded with Republicans, “My friends, what the hell are you waiting for?”\n\nRepublicans deride such measures as unconstitutional attempts to take guns from law-abiding Americans, robbing them of their right to defend themselves. Representative Dan Bishop, Republican of North Carolina, expressed outrage that Democrats had painted Republicans as complicit in mass shootings, declaring, “You are not going to bully your way into stripping Americans of fundamental rights.”\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said administration officials had been in close touch with lawmakers over the past several days as a bipartisan group of senators discussed a narrower set of limits on gun ownership.\n\nThe negotiations have centered on expanding background checks and providing incentives for states to pass red flag laws, which allow guns to be seized from dangerous people. The group is also looking at proposals on the safe storage of guns at home, community violence and mental health, according to aides and senators involved in the talks.\n\nWith Republicans unanimously opposed to most major gun control measures, the Senate talks offer what is probably the best chance at finding a bipartisan compromise on guns that could pass the 50-to-50 Senate, where 60 votes are needed to break a filibuster and bring legislation to a vote.\n\nBut the endeavor faces long odds, with little evidence that either side is willing to give ground on a debate that has been stalled for years.\n\nSenator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut is leading the talks for Democrats, joined by his fellow party members Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. The Republican senators they are huddling with include Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nThose nine negotiators met over Zoom on Wednesday to discuss their progress, convening for an hour after days of individual phone calls and smaller meetings with each other and their colleagues. Talks were expected to continue before the Senate returns early next week.\n\n“We are making rapid progress toward a common-sense package that could garner support from both Republicans and Democrats,” Ms. Collins said in a brief statement after the meeting.\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, a top ally to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has also been involved in discussions, including a Tuesday meeting with Mr. Murphy, Ms. Sinema and Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina.\n\nDemocratic leaders have warned that if an agreement cannot be reached quickly, they will force votes on the bills in the House, which do not have Republican support, to demonstrate for Americans which lawmakers are standing in the way of passing gun safety measures.\n\n“I’m cleareyed about the history of failure,” Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview after Wednesday’s meeting. “But if there’s ever a moment to put up or shut up, this one is it.”\n\nIn the days immediately after the Buffalo and Uvalde shootings, both the president and Vice President Kamala Harris largely stayed away from any direct negotiations with lawmakers about how to create a response to the shootings that can pass in Congress.\n\nBut on Thursday, Mr. Biden abandoned that approach, deciding instead to lay down a marker that will cement his legacy as a president who fought for tougher gun laws, successful or not.\n\nIn his speech on Thursday, Mr. Biden described the deep grief that he experienced when he and his wife talked to the families of victims in the two mass shootings.\n\n“At both places, we spent hours with hundreds of family members, who were broken, whose lives will never be the same,” he said. “They had one message for all of us: Do something. Just do something. For God’s sake, do something.”\n\n“How much more carnage are we willing to accept?” he asked. “How many more innocent American lives must be taken before we say: Enough. Enough.”\n\nAnd he made the target of his comment clear, saying it now falls to Congress to pass the far-reaching laws it has refused to in the past.\n\n“The question now is: What will the Congress do?” he said. The president said he supported the efforts by the bipartisan group in the Senate to find a compromise, but called it the least lawmakers should do.\n\nThe approach Thursday night was more like the response from former President Barack Obama in January 2013, just weeks after the shooting at the school in Newtown.\n\nMr. Obama, flanked by Mr. Biden, who was then the vice president, proposed a package of gun control measures, including: ensuring that all gun owners go through a background check; improving state reporting of criminals and the mentally ill; banning assault weapons; and capping magazine clip capacity at 10 bullets.\n\nIn the face of Republican opposition, Mr. Obama dropped his demand for an assault weapon ban and limits on the size of magazine clips. After months of pushing by Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden, the Senate rejected a bipartisan effort to expand background checks.\n\nIn scathing comments after the bill died, Mr. Obama derided senators for deciding that the lives of children were not worth the effort to pass legislation. A decade later, Mr. Obama’s grim assessment stands as a warning for Mr. Biden of what might happen again.\n\n“All in all,” Mr. Obama said at the time, “this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.”\n\nEmily Cochrane , Catie Edmondson and Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting.\n\nThe day before, we visited Uvalde — Uvalde, Texas. In front of Robb Elementary School, we stood before 21 crosses, for 19 third and fourth graders and two teachers. On each cross, a name.\n\nAnd nearby, a photo of each victim, that Jill and I reached out to touch. Innocent victims, murdered in a classroom that had been turned into a killing field. Standing there in that small town, like so many other communities across America, I couldn’t help but think there are too many other schools, too many other everyday places that have become killing fields, battlefields, here in America.\n\nWe stood in such a place just 12 days before, across from a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, memorializing 10 fellow Americans — a spouse, a parent, a grandparent, a sibling, gone forever. At both places, we spent hours with hundreds of family members who were broken, and whose lives will never be the same. They had one message for all of us: Do something. Just do something. For God’s sake, do something.\n\nAfter Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Charleston, after Orlando, after Las Vegas, after Parkland, nothing has been done. This time, that can’t be true. This time, we must actually do something. The issue we face is one of conscience and common sense.\n\nFor so many of you at home, I want to be very clear. This is not about taking away anyone’s guns. It’s not about vilifying gun owners. In fact, we believe we should be treating responsible gun owners as an example of how every gun owner should behave.\n\nI respect the culture and the tradition and the concerns of lawful gun owners. At the same time, the Second Amendment, like all other rights, is not absolute. It was Justice Scalia who wrote, and I quote: “Like most rights, the right Second Amendment — the rights granted by the Second Amendment are not unlimited.” Not unlimited. It never has been.\n\nThere have always been limitations on what weapons you can own in America. For example, machine guns have been federally regulated for nearly 90 years, and this is still a free country. This isn’t about taking away anyone’s rights. It’s about protecting children. It’s about protecting families. It’s about protecting whole communities. It’s about protecting our freedoms to go to school, to a grocery store, to a church, without being shot and killed.\n\nAccording to new data just released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, guns are the No. 1 killer of children in the United States of America. The No. 1 killer. More than car accidents, more than cancer. Over the last two decades, more school-age children have died from guns than on-duty police officers and active-duty military combined.\n\nThink about that. More kids than on-duty cops killed by guns. More kids than soldiers killed by guns. For God’s sake. How much more carnage are we willing to accept? How many more innocent American lives must be taken before we say enough? Enough.\n\nI know that we can’t prevent every tragedy, but here’s what I believe we have to do. Here’s what the overwhelming majority of the American people believe we must do. Here’s what the families in Buffalo and Uvalde, in Texas, told us we must do.\n\nWe need to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines. And if we can’t ban assault weapons, then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21. Strengthen the background checks, enact safe storage laws and “red flag” laws. Repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers from liability. Address the mental health crisis deepening the trauma of gun violence, and as a consequence of that violence.\n\nThese are rational, common-sense measures. Here’s what it all means. It all means this: We should reinstate the assault weapons ban on high capacity magazines that we passed in 1994 with bipartisan support in Congress and the support of law enforcement.\n\nNine categories of semiautomatic weapons were included in that ban, like AK-47s and AR-15s. And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down. But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004, and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.\n\nA few years ago, the family of the inventor of the AR-15 said he would have been horrified to know his design was being used to slaughter children and other innocent lives instead of being used as a military weapon on the battlefields, as it was designed. That’s what it was designed for.\n\nEnough, enough. We should limit how many rounds a weapon can hold. Why in God’s name should an ordinary citizen be able to purchase an assault weapon that holds 30-round magazines that let mass shooters fire hundreds of bullets in a matter of minutes? The damage was so devastating in Uvalde parents had to do DNA swabs to identify the remains of their children. Nine- and 10-year-old children.\n\nEnough. We should expand background checks to keep guns out of the hands of felons, fugitives and those under restraining orders. Stronger background checks are something that the vast majority of Americans, including the majority of gun owners, agree on.\n\nI also believe we should have safe storage laws, and personal liability for not locking up your gun. The shooter in Sandy Hook came from a home full of guns. They were too easy to access. That’s how he got the weapons. The weapon he used to kill his mother, and then murder 26 people, including 20 first graders.\n\nIf you own a weapon, you have a responsibility to secure it. Every responsible gun owner agrees. To make sure no one else can have access to it. To lock it up. To have trigger locks. And if you don’t, and something bad happens, you should be held responsible.\n\nWe should also have national red flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates or experiencing suicidal thoughts — it makes them a danger to themselves or to others. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have red flag laws. The Delaware law is named after my son, Attorney General Beau Biden.\n\nFort Hood, Texas, 2009. Thirteen dead and more than 30 injured. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., 2018. Seventeen dead, 17 injured. In both places, countless others suffering with invisible wounds. Red flag laws could have stopped both these shooters.\n\nIn Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused. But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon, even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21.\n\nIf we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21. Look, I know some folks will say 18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons, but that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.\n\nWe should repeal the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons. They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity.\n\nImagine. Imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued, where we’d be today. The gun industry’s special protections are outrageous. It must end.\n\nAnd let there be no mistake about the psychological trauma that gun violence leaves behind. Imagine being that little girl, that brave little girl in Uvalde, who smeared blood off her murdered friend’s body onto her own face, to lie still among the corpses in her classroom and pretend she was dead in order to stay alive. Imagine. Imagine what it would be like for her to walk down the hallway of any school again.\n\nImagine what it’s like for children who experience this kind of trauma every day in school, on the streets, in communities all across America. Imagine what it’s like for so many parents to hug their children goodbye in the morning, not sure whether they’ll come back home. Unfortunately, too many people don’t have to imagine that at all.\n\nEven before the pandemic, young people were already hurting. There’s a serious youth mental health crisis in this country. We have to do something about it. That’s why mental health is the heart of my unity agenda that I laid out in the State of the Union address this year.\n\nWe must provide more school counselors; more school nurses; more mental health services for students and for teachers. More people volunteering as mentors to help young people succeed. More privacy protection and resources to keep kids safe from the harms of social media.\n\nThis unity agenda won’t fully heal the wounded souls, but it will help. It matters.\n\nI just told you what I’d do. The question now is: What will the congress do?\n\nThe House of Representatives already passed key measures we need: Expanding background checks to cover nearly all gun sales, including at gun shows and online sales. Getting rid of a loophole that allows a gun sale to go through after three business days, even if the background check has not been completed.\n\nAnd the House is planning even more action next week. Safe storage requirements. The banning of high-capacity magazines. Raising the age to buy an assault weapon to 21. Federal red flag law. Codifying my ban on ghost guns that don’t have serial numbers and can’t be traced. And tougher laws to prevent gun trafficking and straw purchases.\n\nThis time, we have to take the time to do something. And this time, it’s time for the Senate to do something.\n\nBut, as we know, in order to get anything done in the Senate, we need a minimum of 10 Republican senators. I support the bipartisan efforts that include a small group of Democrats and Republican senators trying to find a way. But my God. The fact that the majority of the Senate Republicans don’t want any of these proposals even to be debated or come up for a vote, I find unconscionable.\n\nWe can’t fail the American people again. Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday, at a hospital in Tulsa, Okla. A shooter deliberately targeted a surgeon using an assault weapon he bought just a few hours before his rampage that left a surgeon, another doctor, a receptionist and a patient dead, and many more injured. That doesn’t count the carnage we see every single day that doesn’t make the headlines.\n\nI’ve been in this fight for a long time. I know how hard it is, but I’ll never give up. And if Congress fails, I believe this time, a majority of the American people won’t give up, either. I believe the majority of you will act to turn your outrage into making this issue central to your vote. Enough, enough, enough.\n\nOver the next 17 days, the families in Uvalde will continue burying their dead. It will take that long, in part, because it’s a town where everyone knows everyone, and day by day they will honor each one they lost. Jill and I met with the owner and staff of the funeral home, who was being strong, strong, strong to take care of their own. And the people of Uvalde mourned, as they do over the next 17 days. What will we be doing as a nation?\n\nJill and I met with the sister of the teacher who was murdered and whose husband died of a heart attack two days later, leaving behind four beautiful, orphaned children. All now orphans.\n\nThe sister asked us: What could she say? What could she tell her nieces and nephews? The most heartbreaking moments that I can remember. All I could think to say was, I told her to hold them tight. Hold them tight.\n\nAfter visiting the school, we attended Mass at Sacred Heart Catholic Church with Father Eddy. In the pews, family and friends held each other tightly. As Archbishop Gustavo spoke, he asked the children in attendance to come up on the altar and sit in the altar with him, as he spoke. There wasn’t enough room, so a mom and her young son sat next to Jill and me in the first pew.\n\nAnd as we left the church, a grandmother who had just lost her granddaughter passed me a handwritten letter. It read, quote: “Erase the invisible line that is dividing our nation. Come up with a solution and fix what’s broken and make the changes that are necessary to prevent this happening again.” End of quote.\n\nMy fellow Americans, enough. Enough. It’s time for each of us to do our part. It’s time to act. For the children we’ve lost. For the children we can save. For the nation we love. Let’s hear the call and the cry. Let’s meet the moment. Let us finally do something.\n\nGod bless the families who are hurting. God bless you all. From a hymn based in the 91st Psalm, sung in my church: “May he raise you up on eagle’s wings and bear you on the breath of dawn. Make you to shine like the sun and hold you in the palm of his hand.”\n\nThat’s my prayer for all of you. God bless you.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}}",92.14285714285714,2

When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197824584/the-biden-administration-proposes-new-federal-standards-for-nursing-home-care', 'Headline': 'Biden New Federal Standards for Nursing Home Care : NPR', 'Snippet': ""NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, after the Biden Administration proposed a new national standard for staffing nursing homes."", 'Full_text': 'In his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden made a promise to ""protect seniors\' lives."" And he\'s following through on that promise with his latest push to ensure that nursing homes, serving 1.2 million seniors, are sufficiently staffed around the clock.\n\nOn Sept. 1, the Biden administration issued a proposal to establish comprehensive staffing requirements for nursing homes across the country. The President, alongside the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has proposed a minimum nursing staff standard for facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, more than 200,000 residents and staff in long-term care facilities have died because of COVID-19.\n\n""That\'s unacceptable,"" Xavier Becerra, the secretary of HHS, told Morning Edition.\n\nRoughly three quarters of long-term care facilities would have to hire additional staff to meet the administration\'s requirements, CMS estimates.\n\n""It\'s a big change in the sense that the industry hasn\'t had to follow particular standards,"" Becerra said. ""And it\'s been the wild, wild west when it comes to quality and accountability at nursing homes throughout the country. What we\'re simply saying is we don\'t want [the] wild, wild west when we send our loved ones.""\n\nNursing is inevitably a demanding job, and it has been widely regarded as one of the most stressful occupations, according to the journal Acta Biomedica. The profession is associated with high levels of staff turnover, absenteeism and levels of burnout.\n\nIn an attempt to improve nurse retention rates and attract more people to the industry, CMS would work with private sector partners, investing over $75 million in financial incentives, such as tuition reimbursement.\n\nJacob Conrad edited the digital version.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/28/fact-sheet-protecting-seniors-and-people-with-disabilities-by-improving-safety-and-quality-of-care-in-the-nations-nursing-homes/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Protecting Seniors by Improving Safety and Quality of Care ...', 'Snippet': 'To protect residents and crack down on unsafe nursing homes, President Biden will call on Congress to provide almost $500 million to CMS, a nearly 25% increase, to support health and safety ...', 'Full_text': ""All people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and to have access to quality medical care. The President is committed to ensuring that all Americans, including older Americans and people with disabilities, live in a society that is accessible, inclusive, and equitable. To accomplish that goal, the Administration continues to be committed to home- and community-based services and ensuring that in no case should a health care facility be causing a patient harm. The President believes we must improve the quality of our nursing homes so that seniors, people with disabilities, and others living in nursing homes get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve. That’s why he is announcing a set of reforms—developed by and implemented through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—that will improve the safety and quality of nursing home care, hold nursing homes accountable for the care they provide, and make the quality of care and facility ownership more transparent so that potential residents and their loved ones can make informed decisions about care.\n\nTo do this, the reforms the President is announcing will ensure that:\n\nevery nursing home provides a sufficient number of staff who are adequately trained to provide high-quality care;\n\npoorly performing nursing homes are held accountable for improper and unsafe care and immediately improve their services or are cut off from taxpayer dollars; and\n\nthe public has better information about nursing home conditions so that they can find the best available options.\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted the tragic impact of substandard conditions at nursing homes, which are home to many of our most at-risk community members. More than 1.4 million people live in over 15,500 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes across the nation. In the past two years, more than 200,000 residents and staff in nursing homes have died from COVID-19—nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nDespite the tens of billions of federal taxpayer dollars flowing to nursing homes each year, too many continue to provide poor, sub-standard care that leads to avoidable resident harm. In fact, failure to comply with Federal guidelines at nursing homes is widespread. The Government Accountability Office found that, from 2013 to 2017, 82% of all inspected nursing homes had an infection prevention and control deficiency, including a lack of regular handwashing, that was identified through Medicare and Medicaid surveys.\n\nWithout decisive action now, these unacceptable conditions may get worse. Private equity firms have been buying up struggling nursing homes, and research shows that private equity-owned nursing homes tend to have significantly worse outcomes for residents. Private equity firms’ investment in nursing homes has ballooned from $5 billion in 2000 to more than $100 billion in 2018, with about 5% of all nursing homes now owned by private equity firms. Too often, the private equity model has put profits before people—a particularly dangerous model when it comes to the health and safety of vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities. Recent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes:\n\nA recent study found that residents in nursing homes acquired by private equity were 11.1% more likely to have a preventable emergency department visit and 8.7% more likely to experience a preventable hospitalization, when compared to residents of for-profit nursing homes not associated with private equity.\n\nOne working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities over a seventeen-year period found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. That suggests an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nAnother study found that private equity-backed nursing homes’ COVID-19 infection rate and death rate were 30% and 40% above statewide averages, respectively.\n\nResearch also suggests that, despite depriving residents of quality care, private equity-owned nursing homes actually led to an uptick in Medicare costs, too.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new steps by Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) through its Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to improve the quality and safety of nursing homes, to protect vulnerable residents and the health care heroes who care for them, and to crack down on bad actors. The Administration is committed to these urgent actions as first steps toward fulfilling a broader commitment to ensure taxpayer dollars go toward the safe, adequate, and respectful care seniors and people with disabilities deserve—not to the pockets of predatory owners and operators who seek to maximize their profits at the expense of vulnerable residents’ health and safety.\n\nEnsuring Taxpayer Dollars Support Nursing Homes That Provide Safe, Adequate, and Dignified Care\n\nCMS is launching four new initiatives to ensure that residents get the quality care they need—and that taxpayers pay for. These initiatives will help ensure adequate staffing, dignity and safety in their accommodations, and quality care.\n\nEstablish a Minimum Nursing Home Staffing Requirement. The adequacy of a nursing home’s staffing is the measure most closely linked to the quality of care residents receive. For example, a recent study of one state’s nursing facilities found that increasing registered nurse staffing by just 20 minutes per resident day was associated with 22% fewer confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-19 deaths. CMS intends to propose minimum standards for staffing adequacy that nursing homes must meet. CMS will conduct a new research study to determine the level and type of staffing needed to ensure safe and quality care and will issue proposed rules within one year. Establishing a minimum staffing level ensures that all nursing home residents are provided safe, quality care, and that workers have the support they need to provide high-quality care. Nursing homes will be held accountable if they fail to meet this standard.\n\nReduce Resident Room Crowding. Most nursing home residents prefer to have private rooms to protect their privacy and dignity, but shared rooms with one or more other residents remain the default option. These multi-occupancy rooms increase residents’ risk of contracting infectious diseases, including COVID-19. CMS will explore ways to accelerate phasing out rooms with three or more residents and to promote single-occupancy rooms.\n\nStrengthen the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Value-Based Purchasing (“VBP”) Program. The SNF-VBPprogram awards incentive funding to facilities based on quality performance. CMS has begun to measure and publish staff turnover and weekend staffing levels, metrics which closely align with the quality of care provided in a nursing home. CMS intends to propose new payment changes based on staffing adequacy, the resident experience, as well as how well facilities retain staff.\n\nReinforce Safeguards against Unnecessary Medications and Treatments. Thanks to CMS’ National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care in Nursing Homes, the nation has seen a dramatic decrease in the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes in recent years. However, inappropriate diagnoses and prescribing still occur at too many nursing homes. CMS will launch a new effort to identify problematic diagnoses and refocus efforts to continue to bring down the inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications.\n\nEnhancing Accountability and Oversight\n\nHolding nursing homes accountable for their performance requires a robust compliance program—a program that has adequate funding to perform inspections and that imposes meaningful penalties when deficiencies are found. Federal taxpayer dollars should not flow to nursing homes that are unsafe.\n\nAdequately Fund Inspection Activities. For over seven years, funding to conduct health and safety inspections has remained flat while the number of complaints about nursing homes has surged. To protect residents and crack down on unsafe nursing homes, President Biden will call on Congress to provide almost $500 million to CMS, a nearly 25% increase, to support health and safety inspections at nursing homes.\n\nBeef up Scrutiny on More of the Poorest Performers. CMS’s Special Focus Facility (SFF) program identifies the poorest-performing nursing homes in the country for increased scrutiny in an effort to immediately improve the care they deliver. The SFF program currently requires more frequent compliance surveys for program participants, which must pass two consecutive inspections to “graduate” from the program. The SFF program will be overhauled to more quickly improve care for the affected residents, including changes that will make its requirements tougher and more impactful. CMS will also make changes that allow the program to scrutinize more facilities, by moving facilities through the program more quickly. Facilities that fail to improve will face increasingly larger enforcement actions, including termination from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, when appropriate.\n\nExpand Financial Penalties and Other Enforcement Sanctions. CMS will expand the instances in which it takes enforcement actions against poor-performing facilities based on desk reviews of data submissions, which will be performed in addition to on-site inspections. In July 2021, CMS rescinded a Trump Administration change that lowered penalty amounts on bad actor nursing homes for harmful deficiencies by imposing only a one-time fine, instead of more aggressive per-day fines that charge for each day a facility is out of compliance. CMS will now explore making such per-day penalties the default penalty for non-compliance. CMS will also use data, predictive analytics, and other information processing tools to improve enforcement. President Biden is also calling on Congress to raise the dollar limit on per-instance financial penalties levied on poor-performing facilities, from $21,000 to $1,000,000.\n\nIncrease Accountability for Chain Owners of Substandard Facilities. President Biden is calling on Congress to give CMS new authority to require minimum corporate competency to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs, enabling CMS to prohibit an individual or entity from obtaining a Medicare or Medicaid provider agreement for a nursing home (new or existing) based on the Medicare compliance history of their other owned or operated facilities (previous or existing). He is further calling on Congress to expand CMS enforcement authority at the ownership level, enabling CMS to impose enforcement actions on the owners and operators of facilities even after they close a facility, as well as on owners or operators that provide persistent substandard and noncompliant care in some facilities, while still owning others.\n\nProvide Technical Assistance to Nursing Homes to Help them Improve. CMS currently contracts with Quality Improvement Organizations that help providers across the health care spectrum make meaningful quality of care improvements. CMS will ensure that improving nursing home care is a core mission for these organizations and will explore pathways to expand on-demand trainings and information sharing around best practices, while expanding individualized, evidence-based assistance related to issues exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nIncreasing Transparency\n\nFor too long, corporate owners and operators have not been held to account for poor nursing home performance. CMS will improve the public transparency of facility ownership and safeguard nursing home residents.\n\nCreate a Database of Nursing Home Owners and Operators. CMS will create a new database that will track and identify owners and operators across states to highlight previous problems with promoting resident health and safety. This registry will use information collected through provider enrollment and health and safety inspections to provide more information about prospective owners and operators to states. Giving the public a resource to better understand owners’ and operators’ previous violations will empower states to better protect the health and safety of residents.\n\nImprove Transparency of Facility Ownership and Finances. CMS will implement Affordable Care Act requirements regarding transparency in corporate ownership of nursing homes, including by collecting and publicly reporting more robust corporate ownership and operating data. It will also make this information easier to find on the Nursing Home Care Compare website.\n\nEnhance Nursing Home Care Compare: CMS will implement a range of initiatives to improve Nursing Home Care Compare, the rating website designed to help families pick a facility for their loved ones. Under the Biden-Harris Administration’s leadership, CMS has already published new measures on Care Compare, which allow users to consider nursing home staff turnover, weekend staffing levels, and other important factors in their decision-making process. When the new minimum staffing requirement comes online, Care Compare will also prominently display whether a facility is meeting these minimum staffing requirements. CMS will further improve Care Compare by improving the readability and usability of the information displayed—giving you and your family insight into how to interpret key metrics. Finally, CMS will ensure that ratings more closely reflect data that is verifiable, rather than self-reported, and will hold nursing homes accountable for providing inaccurate information. The President is calling on Congress to give CMS additional authority to validate data and take enforcement action against facilities that submit incorrect information.\n\nExamine the Role of Private Equity. As described above, private equity investors are playing a growing role in the nursing home sector, and published research increasingly indicates that facility ownership by investment groups leads to worse outcomes while costing taxpayers more—particularly as these owners have sought to cut expenses at the cost of patient health and safety, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. HHS and other federal agencies will examine the role of private equity, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and other investment ownership in the nursing home sector and inform the public when corporate entities are not serving their residents’ best interests.\n\nCreating Pathways to Good-paying Jobs with the Free and Fair Choice to Join a Union\n\nEnsure Nurse Aide Training is Affordable. Lowering financial barriers to nurse aide training and certification will strengthen and diversify the nursing home workforce. CMSwill establish new requirements to ensure nurse aide trainees are notified about their potential entitlement to training reimbursement upon employment. CMS will further work with states to ensure reimbursement is being distributed and that free training opportunities are widely publicized.\n\nSupport State Efforts to Improve Staffing and Workforce Sustainability. Strengthening the nursing home workforce requires adequate compensation as well as a realistic career ladder. CMS will develop a template to assist and encourage States requesting to tie Medicaid payments to clinical staff wages and benefits, including additional pay for experience and specialization.\n\nLaunch National Nursing Career Pathways Campaign. CMS, in collaboration with the Department of Labor, will work with external entities—including training intermediaries, registered apprenticeship programs, labor-management training programs, and labor unions—to conduct a robust nationwide campaign to recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into long-term care careers, with pathways into health-care careers like registered and licensed nurses.\n\nEnsuring Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness in Nursing Homes\n\nContinued COVID-19 Testing in Long-term Care Facilities. Throughout the pandemic, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided approximately 3 million tests per week to all Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes and thousands more assisted living facilities, supporting outbreak testing and regular testing of staff. HHS will continue to support this key mitigation strategy for vulnerable residents and the staff that care for them.\n\nContinued COVID-19 Vaccinations and Boosters in Long-term Care Facilities. The Biden-Harris Administration has provided the full support of the federal government to states in ensuring that staff and residents across long-term care facilities have access to vaccinations and booster shots. Today, facilities are required to ensure staff are vaccinated and more than 87.1% of residents have received their primary series. CDC continues to offer all facilities the ability to be matched with a federal pharmacy partner to host an on-site vaccination clinic. CMS has reached out to thousands of these facilities directly to offer support, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has made a wide set of tools available. HHS will continue to promote access to these clinics and efforts to integrate vaccinations into routine services, incentivize vaccinations through provider quality payment programs, and continue to provide a full range of resources to continue to build confidence in the vaccine.\n\nStrengthen Requirements for On-site Infection Preventionists. CMS will clarify and increase the standards for nursing homes on the level of staffing facilities need for on-site infection prevention employees, undoing the Trump Administration’s changes to these requirements to help improve resident health and safety.\n\nEnhance Requirements for Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness. Both the pandemic and the increase in natural disasters have demonstrated how critical proactive emergency preparedness is to keeping residents of nursing homes safe. CMS is examining and considering changes to emergency preparedness requirements and is working to bolster the resiliency of the health care sector as part of an Administration-wide effort to be ready for the next pandemic and the next weather-related emergencies.\n\nIntegrate Pandemic Lessons into Nursing Home Requirements. The pandemic has underscored the need for resident-centered updates to nursing homes’ requirements of participation in Medicare and Medicaid. CMS will integrate new lessons on standards of care into nursing home requirements around fire safety, infection control, and other areas, using an equity lens.\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/01/1197074873/nursing-homes-staff-ratio-biden-medicare-medicaid', 'Headline': ""Nursing home staffing requirements could fizzle, despite Biden's ... - NPR"", 'Snippet': ""A study commissioned by the government to recommend minimum staffing levels at nursing homes drew no conclusions. And that means Biden's pledge to set those minimums may come to far less than hoped."", 'Full_text': 'Update: The Biden administration released its recommendation on nursing home staffing ratios after this story published on Sept. 1. The proposed rule would require each resident get 33 minutes of care a day from a registered nurse. It also would mandate that at least one RN be working at a facility 24 hours a day. For nurse\'s aides, the care hours recommended are 2.45 hours per resident per day, a total below what was studied in the research referenced in this story. The comment period for the proposed rule goes until Nov. 6.\n\nThe Biden administration last year promised to establish minimum staffing levels for the nation\'s roughly 15,000 nursing homes. It was the centerpiece of an agenda to overhaul an industry the government said was rife with substandard care and failures to follow federal quality rules.\n\nBut a research study the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services commissioned to identify the appropriate level of staffing made no specific recommendations and analyzed only staffing levels lower than what the previous major federal evaluation had considered best, according to a copy of the study reviewed this week by KFF Health News. Instead, the new study said there was no single staffing level that would guarantee quality care, although the report estimated that higher staffing levels would lead to fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits, faster care, and fewer failures to provide care.\n\nPatient advocates said the report was the latest sign that the administration would fall short of its pledge to establish robust staffing levels to protect the 1.2 million Americans in skilled nursing facilities.\n\nResidents at risk\n\nAlready, the administration is six months behind its self-imposed deadline of February to propose new rules. Those proposals, which have not been released, were under evaluation from May until this week by the Office of Management and Budget. The study, dated June 2023, has not been formally released either, but a copy was posted on the CMS website. It was taken down shortly after KFF Health News published this article.\n\n""It\'s honestly heartbreaking,"" said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for nursing home patients in New York state. ""I just don\'t see how this doesn\'t ultimately put more residents at risk of neglect and abuse. Putting the government\'s imprimatur on a standard that is patently unsafe is going to make it much more difficult for surveyors to hold facilities accountable for the harm caused by understaffing nursing homes.""\n\nFor months, the nursing home industry has been lobbying strenuously against a uniform ratio of patients to nurses and aides. ""What is clear as you look across the country is every nursing home is unique and a one-size-fits-all approach does not work,"" said Holly Harmon, senior vice president of quality, regulatory, and clinical services at the American Health Care Association, an industry trade group.\n\nGrueling work, low pay\n\nNursing home groups have emphasized the widespread difficulty in finding workers willing to fill existing certified nursing assistant jobs, which are often grueling and pay less than what workers can make at retail stores. Homes say their licensed nurses are often drawn away by other jobs, such as better-paying hospital positions. ""The workforce challenges are real,"" said Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of LeadingAge, an association that represents nonprofit nursing homes.\n\nThe industry has also argued that if the government wants it to hire more workers it needs to increase the payments it makes through state Medicaid programs, which are the largest payor for nursing home care. Advocates and some researchers have argued that nursing homes, particularly for-profit ones, can afford to pay employees more and hire additional staff if they forsake some of the profits they give investors.\n\n""Certainly, facilities haven\'t put all the dollars back into direct care over the years,"" said David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. ""But for certain facilities, it\'s going to be a big lift to pay for"" higher staffing levels, he said in an interview last week.\n\nWidely anticipated study\n\nIn a written statement to KFF Health News, Jonathan Blum, CMS\' principal deputy administrator and chief operating officer, said the study had been posted in error.\n\n""CMS is committed to holding nursing homes accountable for protecting the health and safety of all residents, and adequate staffing is critical to this effort,"" he said. ""CMS\'s proposal is being developed using a rigorous process that draws on a wide range of source information, including extensive input from residents and their families, workers, administrators, experts, and other stakeholders. Our focus is on advancing implementable solutions that promote safe, quality care for residents.""\n\nBlum\'s statement called the study a ""draft,"" although nothing in the 478-page study indicated it was preliminary.\n\nThe study has been widely anticipated, both because of the central role the administration said it would play in its policy and because the last major CMS study, conducted in 2001, had concluded that nursing home care improves as staffing increases up to the level of about one worker for every six residents. The formal metric for that staffing level was 4.1 staff hours per resident per day, which is calculated by dividing the number of total hours worked by nurses and aides on duty daily by the number of residents present each day.\n\nCMS never adopted that staffing ratio and instead gave each nursing home discretion to determine a reasonable staffing level. Regulators rarely cite nursing homes for insufficient staffing, even though independent researchers have concluded low staffing is the root of many nursing home injuries. Too few nurse aides, for instance, often means immobile residents are not repositioned in bed, causing bedsores that can lead to infection. Low staffing also is often responsible for indignities residents face, such as being left in soiled bedsheets for hours.\n\n\'Sabotaged\'\n\nThe new research was conducted by Abt Associates, a regular contractor for CMS that also performed the 2001 study. But the report, in an implicit disagreement with its predecessor, concluded there was ""no obvious plateau at which quality and safety are maximized or \'cliff\' below which quality and safety steeply decline."" Abt referred questions about the study to CMS.\n\nThe study evaluated four minimum staffing levels, all of which were below the 4.1 daily staff hours that the prior study had identified as ideal. The highest was 3.88 daily staff hours. At that level, the study estimated 0.6% of residents would get delayed care and 0.002% would not get needed care. It also said that staffing level would result in 12,100 fewer hospitalizations of Medicare residents and 14,800 fewer emergency room visits. The report said three-quarters of nursing homes would need to add staff to meet that level and that it would cost $5.3 billion extra each year.\n\nThe lowest staffing level the report analyzed was 3.3 daily staffing hours. At that level, the report said, 3.3% of residents would get delayed care and 0.04% would not get needed care. That level would reduce hospitalizations of Medicare residents by 5,800 and lead to 4,500 fewer emergency room visits. More than half of nursing homes would have to increase staff levels to meet that ratio, the report said, and it would cost $1.5 billion more each year.\n\nCharlene Harrington, a professor emeritus of nursing at the University of California-San Francisco, said CMS ""sabotaged"" the push for sufficiently high staffing through the instructions it gave its contractor. ""Every threshold they looked at was below 4.1,"" she said. ""How can that possibly be a decent study? It\'s just unacceptable.""'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-steps-to-improve-quality-of-nursing-homes/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Announces New Steps to ...', 'Snippet': 'Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions to increase accountability of bad actors in the nursing home industry, improve the quality of nursing homes and make them safer.', 'Full_text': ""For far too long, nursing home residents have been victims of an industry with little accountability to keep American seniors safe and protected.

These efforts complement the Administration’s investments in home and community-based services to prevent unnecessary nursing home admissions and help nursing home residents transition back home when possible.\n\nMore Aggressive Enforcement for the Worst-Performing Nursing Homes\n\nToday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced new actions to significantly strengthen accountability for nursing homes in the Special Focus Facilities (SFF) Program, an oversight program for the poorest performing nursing homes in the country. The SFF Program already provides more frequent inspections of these nursing homes, but more action is needed to ensure these nursing homes improve.\n\nThe SFF Program reforms announced for the first time today:\n\nIncrease penalties for nursing homes in the program that fail to improve: CMS will, effective immediately, begin using escalating penalties for violations, including considering facilities with citations for dangerous violations in two successive inspections for termination from Medicare and/or Medicaid funding.\n\nIncrease safety standards for improvement: Under today’s changes, CMS is increasing the requirements that nursing homes in the SFF Program must meet to be successful and graduate from the program. Even after a facility graduates from the program, CMS will now continue close scrutiny of the facility for at least 3 years—helping ensure these nursing homes consistently maintain compliance with safety requirements.\n\nIncrease technical assistance: CMS is also increasing its engagement with these poor-performing nursing homes, through direct and immediate outreach by CMS officials upon their selection as an SFF, to help them understand how to improve and to access support resources like CMS Quality Improvement Organizations.\n\nMore Resources to Support Good-Paying, Union Jobs in Nursing Home Care\n\nSufficient, high-quality staffing is the measure most closely linked to the quality-of-care residents receive. Creating good-paying, union jobs in the nursing home industry—and career pathways into those jobs—promotes the “double dignity” of both patients and workers. That’s why today the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the Department of Labor (“DOL”) are highlighting funds that are newly available to support pathways into good-quality nursing jobs—including for the nursing home workforce:\n\nA wide variety of workforce stakeholders can apply for $80 million in grant funding available right now: Now through January 6, nonprofit healthcare organizations, industry organizations or trade groups, labor unions, labor management organizations, education and training providers, workforce development entities, and Native American Tribal Governments can apply for the DOL’s Nursing Expansion Grant program, which will provide $80 million in grants to help address bottlenecks in training the U.S. nursing workforce and expand and diversify the pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. Specifically, these funds will help: 1) increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators, and 2) train frontline healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance along a career pathway and attain recognized postsecondary credentials, including Licensed Practical Nurses and Registered Nurses. This program will emphasize training those from historically marginalized and underrepresented populations, which helps to address the growing health equity gap in medically underserved communities.\n\nHHS is announcing $13 million in grants to expand nursing education and training: These funds made available through the Health Resources and Services Administration will help expand the number of nursing preceptors—experienced licensed clinicians who supervise nursing students during their clinical rotations. Expanding preceptors will help support the goal of nursing schools admitting more students by providing more opportunities for well-supported clinical rotations and, ultimately, career paths.\n\nHHS and DOL will provide opportunities to apply for additional federal funds to support the nursing workforce pipeline: HHS and DOL have identified hundreds of millions of dollars in funds coming online over the next year to help improve nurse staffing and workforce sustainability. The Biden-Harris Administration encourages eligible entities to braid these programs to attract and retain high-quality workers to serve in healthcare professions such as nursing aides, home health aides, and registered nurses:\n\nBy the end of this year, DOL’s Employment and Training Administration’s (ETA’s) YouthBuild will make available approximately $90 million in grant funding for eligible nonprofit organizations or consortia eligible to provide education or employment training under a Federal program, in order to provide job training and educational opportunities for at-risk youth, with over one-third of recent grantees offering healthcare-related training.\n\nOn a rolling basis, ETA’s National Dislocated Worker Grants program makes tens of millions or more in grant funding available to eligible States, outlying areas designated by the Governor, and organizations eligible for funding through the Native American Programs to develop training in entry-level nursing occupations such as Certified Nursing Assistant, Medical Assisting, and Physical Therapy. These funds help develop training after major economic dislocations, such as plant closures, mass layoffs, or higher-than-average demand for employment and training activities for dislocated members of the Armed Forces and their spouses—with approximately three-quarters of grantees connecting participants to careers in healthcare.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, ETA’s WORC Initiative Grants will make available up to $35 million in grants to eligible State Government, County Government, City or Township Government, Special District Government, Regional Organization, Independent School District, Public/State Controlled Institution of Higher Education, Private Institution of Higher Education, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Indian/Native American Tribal Governments. These grant funds enable impacted communities to develop local and regional workforce development solutions aligned with existing economic development strategies and community partnerships to promote new, sustainable job opportunities and long-term economic vitality, all to support dislocated workers, new entrants to the workforce, and incumbent workers for good jobs in high-demand occupations including behavioral health, dental health, and health IT.\n\nBuilding On Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s efforts build on the many other actions the Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to improve nursing home quality and accountability since President Biden announced the Nursing Home Reform Action Plan in the State of the Union:\n\nEstablishing minimum staffing requirements: CMS launched a public input process and research study that will inform future rulemaking on a minimum staffing requirement, and the proposed rule is on track for release by Spring 2023.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection: CMS is working with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to crack down on nursing homes that illegally hold families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nIncreasing transparency & accountability: CMS made available more data on who owns Medicare-certified nursing homes, helping empower families who are comparison shopping to understand whether a nursing home is part of a bad chain. CMS also released data publicly—for the first time—on mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, and changes of ownership for nursing homes and hospitals enrolled in Medicare.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding: CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for fiscal year (FY) 2023, including a nearly billion dollar payment increase and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program. CMS also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for nursing home residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention efforts—i.e., to tie Medicaid payments to measures of safety and quality of care.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop: CMS launched its enhanced Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System, integrating data on nursing homes’ weekend staffing rates for nurses and information on annual turnover among nurses and administrators. The updated Star Ratings increase transparency to make it easier for families to comparison shop to find the reliable, quality care their loved ones deserve.\n\nPreventing fraudsters from receiving Medicare funds: CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks to be eligible for Medicare funds, preventing abuse and Medicare fraud by nursing home owners.\n\nEnsuring pandemic preparedness: CMS updated its guidance to nursing home inspectors, including, among other things, requiring infection control specialists to be on site—not just off-site consultants as the prior Administration allowed.\n\n###\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/04/06/1088660155/nursing-home-minimum-staffing-labor-shortage-medicare-medicaid-nurses', 'Headline': 'Biden calls for minimum staffing requirement in nursing homes - NPR', 'Snippet': 'The Biden administration is planning to establish a federal minimum staffing requirement for nursing homes as part of a broader push to improve care for seniors and people with disabilities.', 'Full_text': 'A decade after suffering a stroke that forever changed his life, Maurice Miller has good days and bad ones.\n\nOn good days, the staff at his nursing home in Takoma Park, Md., can meet all of his basic needs: feeding him, cleaning him, changing his hospital gown, and ensuring that his laptop, which he uses through dictation, is charged and within reach.\n\nOn bad days, something goes wrong and it takes awhile before someone is available to respond to his call button — sometimes 45 minutes or longer.\n\n""It\'s a bad day when I\'m in pain, and I\'m not going to get relief in a timely fashion,"" says Miller, who describes himself as a functional quadriplegic.\n\nIt\'s also a bad day when he cannot call his 94-year-old mother, because his computer has been pushed out of reach. Or when his roommate is having a crisis of some sort and help does not come immediately. Or when he misses his wheelchair time because there aren\'t enough staff to lift him out of bed.\n\nThe bad days are more likely to be those when the facility is short-staffed. Lying in bed in his darkened room, Miller usually knows when there are fewer than five nursing assistants tending to the 50 or so residents on his hall. He hears about it from the staff, who apologize for the long waits and ask for patience.\n\nThe Biden administration is vowing to improve nursing home care by setting a minimum staffing requirement\n\nStories like Miller\'s — and far worse — have pushed the Biden administration to call for major reforms in nursing homes. Earlier this year, the White House outlined an ambitious plan to improve the safety and quality of nursing home care, first and foremost by establishing a federal minimum staffing requirement for nursing homes funded through Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n""We think it\'s really important to set a very specific standard that can be measured against, to really make sure staff is adequate to ensure quality,"" says Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that regulates and funds most nursing homes in the U.S.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that understaffing nursing homes can harm the health of residents, who suffer more bedsores, more weight loss, more overprescribing of anti-psychotic medications, and — during the pandemic — more COVID-19 cases and deaths.\n\nBrooks-LaSure says her agency will determine how much staff nursing homes should be required to have and then enforce that through a rule. She aims to have a rule in place within a year, an optimistic time frame given the lengthy federal rulemaking process and other challenges.\n\nThe nursing home industry calls minimum staffing requirements ""unrealistic""\n\nThe American Health Care Association, which represents 14,000 long-term care facilities, has called into question the administration\'s authority to enact such a rule without involving Congress. Its president, Mark Parkinson, has also argued that such a requirement is ""unrealistic"" and ""not possible"" because nursing homes can\'t find workers.\n\nNationwide, nursing homes are down more than 240,000 employees since the start of the pandemic, according to the Labor Department. Facilities across the country are grappling with numerous unfilled positions as a result of staff departures during the pandemic.\n\n""If they had a minimum staffing requirement that, if you were unable to meet, you could not operate, that would close every building in the country,"" Parkinson said during a media call following the release of the administration\'s plan.\n\nCurrent federal staffing requirements for nursing homes are vague\n\nThe federal government does already have some staffing requirements in place — for example, each facility must have a registered nurse on duty for eight hours per day — but the core language is vague.\n\nThe 1987 Nursing Home Reform Act, which brought sweeping changes to the industry, requires facilities to have ""sufficient"" staff so that residents can achieve or maintain their ""highest practicable"" physical, mental and psychosocial well-being.\n\n""It\'s so that each person gets exactly what they need to be the best they can be and live their best life,"" says Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at the Consumer Voice, a group focused on long-term care. ""What has been so ambiguous and subjective is how \'sufficient\' is interpreted.""\n\nOverwhelmed nursing assistants say understaffing leads to an assembly line approach to care\n\nIn Baltimore, Holly Ward is a geriatric nursing assistant at a nursing home that has earned an ""above average"" rating for staffing from CMS. Still, on some shifts, she has as many as 13 residents to dress, feed, clean, change, move. One after another.\n\n""So it becomes like an assembly line,"" Ward says.\n\nAnd not one that runs smoothly. Ward will find that while she\'s attending to one resident, another is incontinent. That resident may end up waiting in soiled bedclothes for a while.\n\n""To care for them, you have to give them dignity. That is the main factor they stress at the job, yet you don\'t give us the staff to provide that,"" Ward says.\n\nOften, to meet the basic needs of every resident, Ward says she ends up skipping other important components of their care, such as talking with them and providing emotional support.\n\n""They look to you for comfort, but then when you don\'t have time to adequately give them the comfort they deserve, it\'s not fair,"" says Ward. ""And then it\'s on your conscience.""\n\nNo state in the U.S. meets the federally recommended nursing home staffing levels\n\nMaryland, where Ward works, actually does have a minimum staffing requirement for nursing homes, as do most states. But those state-level requirements are all lower than what the federal government recommended more than two decades ago, the last time the issue was studied.\n\nIn a 2001 report, CMS found that in order to avoid bad outcomes, nursing home residents should each receive at least 4.1 hours of direct nursing care per day. In 29 states, including Maryland, the minimum staffing requirement is 3.5 hours or less, according to an analysis by the Consumer Voice. In some states, the minimum requirement is half the recommended level.\n\nTurnover at nursing homes is high as competition for workers has risen\n\nThe only place that has adopted the federal government\'s guidance of 4.1 hours of care per day is Washington, D.C.\n\n""We think about meeting the numbers every single day,"" says Tina Sandri, CEO of Forest Hills of DC. ""It was a daily struggle before COVID. It is even more so now.""\n\nTurnover at her facility, home to about 100 residents, is nearly triple what it was before the pandemic.\n\nBurnout and competition are major factors.\n\n""In D.C., you can work for Amazon at $19 an hour. You can be a dog walker for $18 an hour,"" she says.\n\nSandri struggles to get certified nursing assistants, who typically start at $15.20 an hour, in the door. Four out of 5 who initially express interest in a job don\'t come in for interviews.\n\nAs a nonprofit, Forest Hills of DC doesn\'t have the bandwidth to raise wages, Sandri says. Like most nursing homes in the U.S., it relies on Medicare and Medicaid for most of its funding. Unless the government increases the amount it pays for nursing home care, Sandri says, ""we just don\'t have it in our piggy bank.""\n\nTo meet Washington, D.C.\'s staffing requirements, she has been working her staff ""to the bones.""\n\n""They\'re tired. They\'re burned out. They\'re physically exhausted, and even committed people in this industry will turn around and say, \'I don\'t know how much longer I can do this,\'"" says Sandri.\n\nShe\'s opposed to a federal minimum staffing requirement, noting that the government already has the ability to cite nursing homes for insufficient staffing. Why hold facilities to a number when there aren\'t people to fill the jobs?\n\nThe government wants to look into how taxpayer dollars are being spent\n\nCMS administrator Brooks-LaSure says she\'s listening to industry concerns, including their call for more money to keep up with rising costs, especially labor. But she\'s also looking into how the taxpayer money pouring into nursing homes, in particular those owned by private equity firms, is being spent.\n\n""Are we using our dollars well? Are they going to direct care?"" she asks.\n\nIn Takoma Park, Maurice Miller doesn\'t blame the staff who have left his facility in recent weeks for other jobs. Two years into the pandemic, he says it\'s time for them to take care of themselves.\n\nBut he is appealing to younger people to consider a job in a nursing home.\n\n""You have an opportunity to save my life,"" he says. ""You have an opportunity to turn this industry on its head.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/11/15/biden-harris-administration-continues-unprecedented-efforts-increase-transparency-nursing-home-ownership.html', 'Headline': 'Biden-Harris Administration Continues Unprecedented Efforts to Increase ...', 'Snippet': 'Final rule will require disclosure of new information to shine a light on private equity ownership.

Today’s final rule includes definitions of private equity and real estate investment trusts, setting the stage for identifying whether a nursing home belongs to one of these types of owners. These actions continue to build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s unwavering commitment to improving the safety and quality of care in the nation’s nursing homes and President Biden’s historic Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. Earlier this year, CMS and HHS also proposed a rule in September to establish national minimum staffing standards for nursing homes to enhance the quality and safety of care.\n\n“HHS continues to take action to improve the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing homes,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “The Biden-Harris Administration believes that residents living in nursing homes should receive the dignity, care, and respect they deserve. Taking steps to help consumers to learn more about the owners of a nursing home will allow them to make the choice that best meets their needs.”\n\n“CMS is committed to leveraging our tools to improve safety and quality of care in nursing homes, CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said. “By strengthening our ability to examine nursing home ownership, including private equity and real estate investment trusts, we can improve transparency for the people we serve and their loved ones, researchers, and regulators, and enable better informed decisions about nursing home care.”\n\nThe final rule requires nursing homes enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid — the majority of this country’s nursing homes — to disclose additional information regarding their owners, operators, and management; for example, nursing homes will disclose individuals or entities that provide administrative services or clinical consulting services to the nursing homes. Nursing homes will also be required to disclose entities that exercise financial control over the facility, such as an organization the nursing home hires to manage all of its financial matters.\n\nNursing homes frequently use other companies to provide major services or supports within a facility, but families currently have no way of knowing which different companies or firms provide care to their loved ones and how they might be connected to the owners of a nursing home. That will change under this rule. The final rule also requires additional information about entities that lease or sublease property to nursing homes, since the facilities and property owners may be set up as different corporate entities even though the entities work hand-in-hand.\n\nConcerns about the quality of care and operations of nursing facilities owned by private equity companies and other types of investment firms have increased since 2011, and the sector continues to attract robust sales.\n\nThe number of nursing homes sold each year has increased since 2016, generously outpacing that of hospitals. Between 2016 and 2021, 348 hospitals experienced a change in ownership, but 3,000 nursing homes experienced a change in ownership – four times more than hospitals. Nursing homes with lower Star quality ratings are sold more often than those with higher Star quality ratings, raising concerns about the relationship between ownership changes and quality.\n\nRecent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes, and in the two to three years after real estate investment trusts invest in nursing homes, registered nurse staffing levels decline by as much as 6%. Private equity ownership of nursing homes may also lead to an uptick in Medicare costs. Additionally, the 10 largest nursing home chains own more than 10% of nursing homes — a disproportionate share that raises concerns about market concentration.\n\nThe additional data required to be reported under the rule will be public, allowing families to make more informed choices about the care of their loved ones. This will also enable CMS and others to scrutinize more closely how ownership types correlate with care outcomes and to determine which environments are more likely to deliver better care for residents and patients.\n\nFor a fact sheet on the final nursing home ownership disclosure rule, visit: https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/disclosures-ownership-and-additional-disclosable-parties-information-skilled-nursing-facilities-and-0\n\nFor the ASPE report on nursing home ownership and quality trends, visit:\n\nhttps://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/nh-ownership-its-implications-quality-availability-care.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/02/13/biden-harris-administration-continues-unprecedented-efforts-to-increase-transparency.html', 'Headline': 'Biden-Harris Administration Continues Unprecedented Efforts to Increase ...', 'Snippet': 'Between 2016 and 2021, 348 hospitals experienced a change in ownership, but 3,000 nursing homes experienced a change in ownership.

Over the past year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has taken historic actions to deliver on the President’s call to action and ensure seniors and people with disabilities get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve.\n\nToday, in a continued effort to deliver on the President’s commitment, HHS announced additional action to increase the transparency of nursing home ownership and management. The Department issued a proposed rule to require nursing homes to disclose to CMS and states additional ownership and management information. The rule also includes private equity and real estate investment trust definitions, setting the stage for the disclosure of whether nursing home owners are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. The proposal marks an important step in continuing to implement President Biden’s initiative to improve the quality and care available at nursing homes. By making facility ownership and oversight more transparent, nursing home residents and their families will be more empowered to make informed decisions about care.\n\n“President Biden has made clear: improving our nation’s nursing homes is an urgent priority, and this Administration is not afraid to take bold action to tackle this head-on,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “We are continuing our unprecedented efforts to increase nursing home ownership transparency – because it’s what the public deserves. We are pursuing all avenues to shine a light on this industry. We will keep doing everything we can to ensure all Americans receive the dignity, care, and respect they deserve.”\n\n“CMS is committed to using every tool at our disposal to improve nursing home care and identify trends that enhance residents’ quality of life,” CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said. “If finalized, this rule would strengthen our ability to examine ownership types, including private equity and real estate investment trusts.”\n\nThe proposed rule would implement portions of Section 6101(a) of the Affordable Care Act. This would require nursing homes enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid — the majority of this country’s nursing homes — to disclose additional information regarding owners, operators, and management; for example, nursing homes would disclose individuals or entities that provide administrative services or clinical consulting services to the nursing homes.\n\nNursing homes frequently use other companies to provide major services or support, but families currently have no way of knowing which different companies or firms provide care to their loved ones and how they might be connected to the owners of a nursing home. The proposed rule would also require additional information about entities that lease or sublease property to nursing homes, since the facilities and property owners may be set up as different corporate entities even though the entities work hand-in-hand.\n\nIn addition to the Section 6101(a) disclosures, the proposed rule would provide definitions of “private equity company” and “real estate investment trust” to assist nursing homes when reporting this data.\n\nThese key definitions will lead to the disclosure of whether direct and indirect nursing home owners are private equity companies or real estate investment trusts via an updated nursing home enrollment application expected to be ready for public use in the summer of 2023.Concerns about the quality of care and operations of nursing facilities owned by private equity companies and other types of investment firms have increased since 2011. Recent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes:\n\nA recent study found that residents in nursing homes acquired by private equity were 11.1% more likely to have a preventable emergency department visit and 8.7% more likely to experience a preventable hospitalization, when compared to residents of for-profit nursing homes not associated with private equity.\n\nOne working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities over a 17-year period found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership. Another study found that private equity-backed nursing homes had a COVID-19 infection rate and death rate that were 30% and 40% above statewide averages, respectively.\n\nResearch also suggests that private equity ownership of nursing homes may lead to an uptick in Medicare costs, too.\n\nThe additional data required to be reported under the rule would be publicly reported pursuant to section 6101(b) of the Affordable Care Act. This transparency will, among other things, allow families to make more informed choices about the care of their loved ones, and it will enable CMS and others to scrutinize more closely how ownership types correlate with care outcomes and to determine which environments are more likely to deliver better care for residents and patients.\n\nThese new data and analysis support President Joe Biden’s Executive Order on Promoting Competition, and advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of improving transparency around nursing facility ownership and improve competition of the overall industry. Greater transparency will help both the Administration and external parties better understand how the nursing home market is changing and whether the market is becoming more concentrated, which could potentially disrupt market competition and affect quality of care. For example, data analysis has shown:\n\nBetween 2016 and 2021, 348 hospitals experienced a change in ownership, but 3,000 nursing homes experienced a change in ownership. The number of nursing homes sold each year has increased since 2016.\n\nThe largest 10 nursing home chains own more than 10% of nursing homes—a disproportionate share that raises concerns about market concentration.\n\nNursing homes with lower Star quality ratings are sold more often than those with higher Star quality ratings, raising concerns about the relationship between ownership changes and quality.\n\nRecently published research has found that in the 2-3 years after real estate investment trusts invest in nursing homes, registered nurse staffing levels decline by as much as 6%.\n\nToday’s proposed rule builds on the Department’s historic releases of data and unprecedented efforts to increase transparency. In April 2022, CMS released data publicly – for the first time ever – on mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, and changes of ownership from 2016-2022 for hospitals and nursing homes enrolled in Medicare. In September 2022, CMS released additional data publicly on the ownership of approximately 15,000 nursing homes certified as a Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility, regardless of any change in ownership, including providing more information about organizational owners of nursing homes. In December 2022, CMS released ownership data publicly — for the first time ever — for all Medicare-certified hospitals.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/health/nursing-home-staffing-cms.html', 'Headline': 'Federal Officials Propose New Nursing Home Standards to Increase ...', 'Snippet': 'The nation’s most thinly staffed nursing homes would be required to hire more workers under new rules proposed on Friday by the Biden administration, the greatest change to federal nursing home ...', 'Full_text': 'The nation’s most thinly staffed nursing homes would be required to hire more workers under new rules proposed on Friday by the Biden administration, the greatest change to federal nursing home regulations in three decades.\n\nThe proposed standard was prompted by the industry’s troubled performance earlier in the coronavirus pandemic, when 200,000 nursing home residents died. But the proposal falls far short of what both the industry and patient advocates believe is needed to improve care for most of the 1.2 million Americans in nursing homes.\n\nThe proposal, by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, would require all facilities to increase staff up to certain minimum levels, but it included no money for nursing homes to pay for the new hires.\n\nC.M.S. estimated that three-quarters of the nation’s 15,000 homes would need to add staff members. But the increases at many of those facilities would be minor, as the average nursing home already employs nurses and aides at, or very close to, the proposed levels.\n\n“The standards are a lot lower than what a lot of experts, including myself, have called for over the years,” said David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. “There are some real positives in here, but I wish the administration had gone further.”\n\nThe government said it would exempt nursing homes from punishment if they could prove that there was a local worker shortage and that the facilities had made sincere efforts to recruit employees.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

These facilities have been plagued by staffing shortages for years, but they’ve gotten much worse during the pandemic and threaten resident care and infection control.\n\n“Establishing a minimum staffing level ensures that all nursing home residents are provided safe, quality care and that workers have the support they need to provide high-quality care,” the White House said in a press release. “Nursing homes will be held accountable if they fail to meet this standard.”\n\nExactly what that standard looks like — or how facilities will be held accountable — are to be determined.

His plan will take important steps to better protect seniors in nursing homes and includes key policies that AARP has been advocating on.”\n\nChiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), told AARP in an interview that she has “personally met with nursing home residents, with CNAs — with certified nursing assistants — as well as the industry and ombudsmen to really hear what is happening on the ground.”\n\n“We have an ambitious agenda,” Brooks-LaSure says. “All of the things we’re doing are really focused on helping caregivers to be able to make better decisions if nursing home care is the right decision for their loved one.”\n\nAddressing staffing shortages\n\nNursing homes have recorded nearly 1 million COVID cases among residents and more than a million cases among staffers in the past two years, according to data from the CMS, which regulates the facilities along with state survey agencies. Even for staffers with mild symptoms, a positive test usually means at least a few days away from work. Huge numbers of certified nursing assistants, who generally make little more than minimum wage, have not received a COVID-19 booster shot.\n\n“Staffing is clearly the number one issue across the long-term care spectrum. It’s huge, not just for nursing homes but for all health care facilities,” says Mark Miller, Washington, D.C.’s long-term care ombudsman and the president of the National Association of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs. “That’s going to take a long time to build up, but that\'s the most significant piece to this.”\n\nWhile COVID deaths among residents have recently declined nationally as the omicron surge has waned, staffing shortages and cases among staff spiked in the four-week period ending Jan. 23, according to an AARP analysis of CMS data. Nearly 2 in 5 U.S. nursing homes reported a staffing shortage in that window.\n\nIn some states, the shortages were more dire. In Alaska, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming, more than 60 percent of facilities statewide reported a lack of staff.\n\nA growing body of research has connected short-staffed facilities with more severe COVID outbreaks, so residents are potentially at greater risk of infection when there aren’t enough nurses and other staff to go around.\n\nBut nursing home operators have long pushed back on mandatory staffing minimums, saying the real issue is that there aren’t enough interested and qualified workers to go around.\n\n“We would love to hire more nurses and nurse aides to support the increasing needs of our residents,” Mark Parkinson, president and CEO of the American Health Care Association, which represents more than 14,000 nursing homes and long-term care facilities, said in a statement. “However, we cannot meet additional staffing requirements when we can’t find people to fill the open positions, nor when we don’t have the resources to compete against other employers.”\n\nIncreasing fines, sanctions on ‘substandard facilities’\n\nThe White House proposal calls for increasing fines and penalties on facilities that fail to meet federal care standards, asking Congress to boost the limit on fines per infraction in some cases from $21,000 to $1 million.\n\nThe administration is also calling on Congress to significantly expand federal regulators’ ability to target bad actors — and to boost CMS funding by nearly 25 percent to $500 million annually for health and safety inspections of nursing homes. Under the White House proposal, regulators would be able to better track nursing home operators’ history of penalties and infractions.\n\n“When you get a Medicaid contract through CMS, they’re taken individually. It’s not like you’re looking at my past performance at other facilities that I owned,” says Miller, who also works with AARP’s Legal Counsel for the Elderly. “This is really going to shine a light on that.”\n\nAmong the White House’s other proposed nursing home reforms:\n\nA new CMS database that will make it easier to track and compare the performance of facilities owned by the same company or owner\n\nThe ability for CMS to go after owners for wrongdoing, even if an individual facility shuts down\n\nA phaseout of nursing home rooms with three or more residents in favor of single-occupancy rooms\n\nGreater oversight of residents’ diagnoses and prescriptions, with a focus on anti-psychotic drugs\n\nContinued funding and support for COVID-19 tests, vaccines and boosters in nursing homes\n\nMiller describes the White House’s plan as “the single most significant set of proposals I’ve seen in 35 years.” But he acknowledges that many of the proposals will require congressional action during a busy and contentious midterm election year. Some aspects of the proposal, like the staffing requirements, may be able to bypass Congress but will still take time to be implemented.\n\n\u200bAnd some critics argue that they don’t go far enough to address other issues like Medicaid reimbursement rates and worker compensation. “Our system of enforcement shouldn’t be based on punishment over improvement,” Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of the LeadingAge association of nonprofit aging services and nursing home providers, said in a statement.\n\nAndrew Soergel covers nursing homes and federal and state policy for AARP.

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

After the first dose of the vaccine, the total effectiveness of all COVID-19 vaccines in our study was 71% (95% CI 0.65, 0.78). The total effectiveness of vaccines after the second dose was 91% (95% CI 0.88, 0.94)). The total efficacy of vaccines after the first and second doses was 81% (95% CI 0.70, 0.91) and 71% (95% CI 0.62, 0.79), respectively. The effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine after the first and second dose was the highest among other studied vaccines ((74% (95% CI, 0.65, 0.83) and 93% (95% CI, 0.89, 0.97), respectively). The highest first dose overall effectiveness of the studied vaccines was against the Gamma variant (74% (95% CI, 0.73, 0.75)), and the highest effectiveness after the second dose was observed against the Beta variant (96% (95% CI, 0.96, 0.96)). The Efficacy for AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines after the first dose was 78% (95% CI, 0.62, 0.95) and 84% (95% CI, 0.77, 0.92), respectively. The second dose Efficacy for AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Bharat was 67% (95% CI, 0.54, 0.80), 93% (95% CI, 0.85, 1.00), and 71% (95% CI, 0.61, 0.82), respectively. The overall efficacy of first and second dose vaccination against the Alfa variant was 84% (95% CI, 0.84, 0.84) and 77% (95% CI, 0.57, 0.97), respectively, the highest among other variants.\n\nConclusion\n\nmRNA-based vaccines against COVID-19 showed the highest total efficacy and effectiveness than other vaccines. In general, administering the second dose produced a more reliable response and higher effectiveness than a single dose.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This β-coronavirus is an enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus, which primarily spreads through the respiratory tract [1,2,3]. COVID-19 infection is often associated with systemic inflammation and inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) increase in the patients [4,5,6]. Cough, fever, and shortness of breath are the dominant symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Additionally, fatigue, increased sputum production, sore throat, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms might be observed [6,7,8]. Elderly patients with underlying disorders such as hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular complications are more prone to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other severe symptoms include septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction, which might lead to death [9, 10]. Various medications have already been tested for treating COVID-19 patients. However, the evidence to support the beneficial effects of these drugs is often controversial [11,12,13]. Molnupiravir is the first oral antiviral drug that has recently shown a significant benefit in reducing hospitalization or death in COVID-19 patients [14].\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, from the emergence of COVID-19 in December 2019 to November 2021, more than 250,000,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported, and more than five million deaths have been attributed to the disease globally [15]. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies have started to develop safe and efficacious vaccines. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of experimental vaccines [16,17,18]. WHO reported as of November 8, 2021, more than seven billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide [15]. Additionally, as per the WHO report, until November 9, 2021, 130 vaccine candidates were under clinical development, and 156 candidates were in the pre-clinical development phase. Different types of COVID-19 vaccines have been developed worldwide, including protein subunit, recombinant, viral vector, RNA- and DNA-based, and sub-unit vaccines [19].\n\nUp to now, several COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized or approved for use. WHO issued an emergency use authorization for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine On December 31, 2020 (BNT162b2). Next, on February 15, 2021, the Astra-Zeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine (manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and SKBio) received emergency use approval, followed by Ad26.COV2.S (developed by Janssen (Johnson & Johnson)) on March 12, 2021, and Moderna vaccine on April 30, 2021 [20]. Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle formulation that contains a nucleoside-modified RNA against the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [21]. Moderna is a lipid nanoparticle–encapsulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA vaccine encoding prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (24). The Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, AZD1222) contains a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenoviral vector ChAdOx1, delivering the SARS-CoV-2 structural surface glycoprotein antigen (spike protein; nCoV-19) gene (22, 23). Janssen is a non-replicating, recombinant human adenovirus type 26, containing a full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein [22]. Bharat (CovaxinTM) is an inactivated-virus vaccine developed in Vero cells combined with Alhydroxiquim-II (Algel-IMDG), chemosorbed imidazoquinoline onto aluminum hydroxide gel. This complex is an adjuvant to boost immune response for longer-lasting immunity [23].\n\nCareful planning for the COVID-19 vaccination program requires comprehensive review studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis to assess the Effectiveness and Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, including AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, Bharat, and Johnson & Johnson. Well-designed meta-analysis studies will provide a more accurate overview to evaluate Efficacy and safety outcomes compared to individual studies and contribute to a better understanding of the use of the vaccine in different populations.\n\nThe present systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for reviewing analytical observational studies [24].\n\nSearch strategy and screening\n\nInternational databases were searched to find all original published articles, including Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Library, Scopus, Ovid, and CINHAL, to retrieve all articles evaluating and reporting the efficacy and side effects of all COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech, Oxford–AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen, CoronaVac, Covaxin, Novavax and Convidecia) in fully vaccinated and partially vaccinated people. The studies which have compared these items with non-vaccinated individuals were also included. In addition to searching the mentioned databases, gray literature was searched by reviewing articles in the first ten pages of Google scholar. A manual search was performed by reviewing references from related studies. This search was conducted with language limitations from November 2020 to September 2022. The search protocol was developed based on four primary roots involving “vaccination,“ “COVID-19,“ “Side effect,“ and “Efficacy.“ All related components to these keywords were “vaccinated”, “non-vaccinated”, “partial vaccinated”, “fully vaccinated”, “Pfizer–BioNTech”, “Oxford–AstraZeneca”, “Sinopharm BIBP”, “Moderna”, “Janssen”, “CoronaVac”, “Covaxin”, “Novavax”, “Convidecia”, “symptoms”, “signs” (“fever”, “cough”, “malaise”, “dyspnea”, “myalgia”, “sore throat”, and “diarrhea”), “thrombosis”, “emboli”, “thromboembolism”, “thromboembolic”, which were added to the searched queries based on scientific Mesh terms, EMTREE, and Thesaurus. Reference Manager bibliographic software was applied to manage searched citations. Duplicate entries were searched by considering the papers’ title, year of publication, authors, and specifications of types of sources. In case of questionable records, the texts were compared. After reviewing the primary search results, each article was double-checked by title and available abstract, and some of the articles were omitted based on the selection criteria. The evaluation of the considered papers was based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria by the two researchers separately (SM, MS). After the screening, (YM) selected the articles by evaluating their full texts.\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nWe included all observational and interventional studies that assessed the Efficacy/Effectiveness and side effects of all types of COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer–BioNTech, Oxford–AstraZeneca, Sinopharm BIBP, Moderna, Janssen, CoronaVac, Covaxin, Novavax and Convidecia) in fully vaccinated and partially vaccinated people. The studies comparing these items with non-vaccinated individuals were also included. We excluded duplicate citations, non-peer-reviewed articles in which the abstract and full text were unavailable, and other languages.\n\nData extraction\n\nAfter screening according to the three assessment steps for titles, abstracts, and full texts, the full text of each selected article was extracted for detailed analysis. The data were retrieved using a checklist recording author, publication year, type of study, mean age, sample size, number of positive tests, Effectiveness/Efficacy after one dose, Effectiveness/Efficacy after the second dose, and number of confirmed COVID cases, hospitalization, and death. From systematic search to final data extraction, all processes were followed independently by two research experts (PM, FM). After the screening, the data extraction was finally approved by (YM).\n\nRisk of bias\n\nThe qualitative evaluation of studies was done according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) [25] by two of the authors (FM, YM). This scale is designed to evaluate the qualitative properties of observational studies (random clinical trials, case-control, retrospective, cohort, and cross-sectional studies). NOS examined each study through six items in three groups: selection, comparability, and exposure. Stars were given to each item, and the maximum score was 9. If the scores assigned to the published articles differed, the external discussion method would be used [26, 27].\n\nThe Jadad checklist was used by two separate authors (PM and FM) to explore potential risks of bias in interventional studies. These scales include items to assess the adequacy of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, the detection of incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential sources of bias [28].\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled Effectiveness/Efficacy with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) with Metaprop order. Calculating the cumulative relative risk (RR) with the 95% confidence interval and the meta set command was used considering the relative risk’s logarithm and logarithm standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 16.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA), and statistical significance was considered at P-Value < 0.05. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by applying the I square value and reported as a percentage (%) to show the extent of variation between studies. A forest plot was used for presenting the meta-analysis results schematically. Egger’s test and funnel plot were applied to evaluate the publication bias. In addition, a subgroup analysis was done to identify different sources of heterogeneity.\n\nCharacteristics of included studies and the participants\n\nA total of 2622 publications were screened for evaluating two items about COVID-19 vaccines: (I) Efficacy and (II) Effectiveness. These two items were assessed according to the virus variant (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma) and the type of vaccine (AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, and Bharat). Data on other vaccines were not included due to inadequate published data. Of these publications, 20 studies met the systematic reviews’ inclusion criteria (non-randomized and randomized) and were included in our meta-analysis (Fig. 1).\n\nOne study was the cohort, four were randomized clinical trials (RCT), and fifteen were case-control. Clinical trials have evaluated vaccines’ efficacy, and observational studies such as cohorts and case controls have assessed their effectiveness. All selected papers were written in English. A total of 1,246,266 cases were included in this study that had received the COVID-19 vaccines. All vaccines were injected intramuscularly (IM). The participants were > 12 years old. The characteristics of included studies have been summarized in Table 1.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nAfter the first dose of the vaccine, the overall effectiveness of all COVID-19 vaccines was estimated to be 71% (95% CI 0.65, 0.78) (Fig. 2).\n\nThe individual efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nThe efficacy after the first dose was evaluated only in 8 of the selected studies, which assessed the efficacy of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. No data was published on the efficacy after the first dose for Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Bharat. After the first dose of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, the pooled efficacy was 78% (95% CI 0.062, 0.95) and 84% (95% CI 0.77, 0.92), respectively. Of the selected publications, eighteen studies reported the efficacy after the second dose of vaccinations. The published data for the second dose Efficacy was only available for AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Bharat vaccines. The second dose pooled Efficacy for AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Bharat was 67% (95% CI 0.54, 0.80), 93% (95% CI 0.85, 1.00), and 71% (95% CI 0.61, 0.82) respectively (Table 2).\n\nThe individual effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nThe first dose Effectiveness of the vaccines was evaluated in seventeen studies. For Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer, the pooled effectiveness after the first dose was 74% (95% CI 0.065, 0.83), 69% (95% CI 0.55, 0.82), and 67% (95% CI 0.51, 0.83) respectively. It was observed that the Effectiveness of Moderna after the first dose was higher than other types of vaccines. The second dose Effectiveness of the vaccines was reported in 17 studies. The pooled effectiveness after the second dose of Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer vaccines was 93% (95% CI 0.89, 0.97), 89% (0.80, 0.97), and 90% (95% CI 0.83, 0.96) respectively; Moderna had higher effectiveness after the second dose, among other studied vaccines (Table 2).\n\nEfficacy of the vaccines against the virus variants\n\nThe overall first and second-dose vaccination Efficacy against different COVID-19 variants is listed in Table 2. The first dose of overall vaccine Efficacy against the Alpha variant was 84%, which was higher than other variants (95% CI 0.84, 0.84). The overall efficacy of the first dose vaccination against the delta variant was only 46% (95% CI 0.45, 0.48), which was the lowest. Similarly, the highest second dose Efficacy was observed against the Alpha variant, which was 77% (95% CI 0.57, 0.97). The overall efficacy of the second dose against the Delta and Beta variants was 64% (95% CI 0.58, 0.69) and 10% (95% CI 0.09, 0.12), respectively.\n\nEffectiveness of the vaccines against the virus variants\n\nThe overall first and second-dose vaccination Effectiveness against different COVID-19 variants is reported in Table 2. The first dose Effectiveness of vaccination against the Gamma variant was 74% (95% CI 0.73, 0.75) which was more than other variants. However, the overall first dose Effectiveness was 82% (95% CI 0.81, 0.82). After the second dose, the highest effectiveness was against the Beta variant (96% (95% CI 0.96, 0.96)). The overall effectiveness after the second vaccination dose was 96% (95% CI 0.096, 0.96) (Table 2).\n\nThe risk of confirmed COVID infection after vaccination (risk ratio)\n\nTwo categories of the selected studies assessed the risk ratio of COVID after vaccination: observational and experimental. Only the pooled risk ratio of AstraZeneca was evaluated in the experimental studies, which was 50% (95% CI 0.35, 0.71). In the observational studies, AstraZeneca and Moderna had the lowest pooled risk ratios, which were 18% (95% CI 0.04, 0.84) and 19% (95% CI 0.17, 0.22), respectively. Bharat had the highest pooled risk ratio (82% (95% CI 0.75, 0.89) (Table 3); however, the number of studies on the Bharat vaccine was fewer than other types of vaccines. Based on the reported experimental studies for the vaccine variants, the Beta variant had the highest (79% (95% CI 0.43, 1.44)), and the Gamma variant had the lowest risk ratio (31% (95% CI 0.18, 0.54)). In the observational studies, Delta had the highest (52% (95% CI 0.27, 1.01), and Gamma had the lowest risk ratio (2% (95% CI 0.02, 0.02)) (Table 3).\n\nSince the emergence of COVID-19, the effort to develop effective vaccines against the infection has been started. Due to the highly contagious nature of the virus, vaccination has been considered a significant measure in the fight against COVID-19. World Health Organization (WHO) allows countries to issue emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines in line with their national regulations and legislation. Domestic emergency use authorizations are issued at the countries’ discretion and are not subject to WHO approval. Up to now, several vaccines have been developed and marketed to limit the spread of COVID-19 infection. As of January 12, 2022, several COVID 19 vaccines have been given Emergency Use Listing (EUL), including those developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Bharat Biotech, etc. [29].\n\nDespite the significant role of COVID-19 vaccination in confining the infection, vaccines’ Efficacy and Effectiveness have not yet been comprehensively discussed. The present study meticulously looked into the Efficacy and Effectiveness of several vaccines.\n\nOur analysis revealed that the overall effectiveness of the studied vaccines after the first dose is significantly less than their effectiveness after the second dose. The first dose’s effectiveness was evaluated in 17 studies. After the first dose, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer’s Effectiveness was 74%, 69%, and 67%, respectively. The Effectiveness of Moderna after the first dose was higher than other types of studied vaccines. Second dose Effectiveness was evaluated in 17 studies. After the second dose of Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer vaccination, the effectiveness was 93%, 89%, and 90, respectively. Moderna provided higher effectiveness after the second dose among other studied vaccines. Therefore, administering the second dose should produce a more reliable response and higher effectiveness than a single dose.\n\nSurprisingly, the overall efficacy of the first dose was significantly more than the second dose; 81% (95% CI 0.70, 0.91) for the first dose compared to 71% (95% CI 0.62, 0.79) for the second dose. This can be explained by the fact that the efficacy after the first dose was evaluated only in 8 studies that assessed only AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. No data was available regarding the efficacy after the first dose of Moderna, Bharat, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. We observed that the first dose Efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine is significantly more than the AstraZeneca vaccine. The Efficacy for AstraZeneca and Pfizer after the first dose vaccination was 78% and 84%, respectively. Concerning the second dose Efficacy, the published data were available only for AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Bharat. In Total, eighteen studies evaluated the efficacy of these vaccines after the second dose. The Efficacy for AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Bharat was 67%, 93%, and 71%, respectively.\n\nWe also investigated the Efficacy and Effectiveness of the first and second-dose vaccination against the COVID-19 virus variants. The overall efficacy of vaccination against the Alfa variant after the first dose was 84%, which was more than other variants. The highest efficacy after the second dose vaccination was also observed for the Alpha variant (77%). The first dose’s effectiveness against the Gamma variant was the highest (74%). Although, the overall first dose effectiveness was 82%. The highest second dose Effectiveness was against the Beta variant (96%), and the overall effectiveness after the second vaccination dose was 96% against all variants.\n\nUp to now, there are other meta-analyses published on the efficacy and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, in the meta-analysis reported by Pormohammad et., al, the efficacy of mRNA-based and adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines in phase II/III randomized clinical trial has been reported as 94.6% (95% CI 0.936–0.954) and 80.2% (95% CI 0.56–0.93), respectively. Additionally, the mRNA-based vaccines showed the highest reported side effects except for diarrhea and arthralgia [30]. However, the research had not reported the efficacy against different variants of the COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the Efficacy and Effectiveness of individual vaccines have not been mentioned; the vaccine Efficacy has been reported based on the vaccine classes. Another meta-analysis reported that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was 91.2% and 98.1%, respectively, while the effectiveness of the CoronaVac vaccine was 65.7% in fully vaccinated individuals [31]. However, this study has not reported the effectiveness of the vaccines against COVID-19 variants or their efficacy.\n\nAdditionally, A previously reported network meta-analysis of various COVID-19 vaccines found Moderna was the most effective vaccine against COVID-19 infection, with an efficacy rate of 88%, followed by Sinopharm and Bharat. The least effective vaccines were Coronavac, Curevac, and AstraZeneca. The mRNA-based vaccines were superior in preventing infection and symptomatic infection, while the inactivated vaccines were most effective in preventing severe COVID-19 infection. Concerning safety, Sinopharm had the highest safety profile in local side effects, while ZF2001 had the highest safety in unsolicited side effects. Inactivated vaccines had the best safety profile in local and systemic side effects, while mRNA-based vaccines had the poorest safety profile. Thromboembolic events were reported after J&J, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna vaccine administration. However, no confirmed vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) cases were reported after mRNA vaccines [32].\n\nIt is necessary to mention that some vaccines’ overall or variant-specific Effectiveness and Efficacy are unavailable after the first or second dose. Moreover, the timing of the second dosing of the vaccines is not elicited in some trials, which may have led to the lower observed overall efficacy after the second dose. Additionally, some reports had noticeable bias by not including enough samples or not considering a broad enough geographical, economic, and age diversity.\n\nWe searched various databases and websites to include the maximum number of relevant publications to prevent database bias; after performing Egger’s regression test, we did not find significant publication bias. However, publication bias and heterogeneity for some pooled results must be considered when interpreting the outcomes.\n\nDespite the valuable information provided by this meta-analysis, the study has some limitations to consider, such as the time frame of the studies (November 2020 to April 2022), the exclusion of unpublished data or ongoing investigations, the subjectivity of study selection criteria, and the limited number of vaccines evaluated. Additionally, the study did not consider differences in vaccine distribution among countries or provide data on the vaccines’ effectiveness against severe disease, hospitalization, or death. Despite its limitations, the meta-analysis highlights the need to continue monitoring the vaccines’ effectiveness.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8918854/', 'Headline': 'Comparing the longer-term effectiveness of a single dose of the Pfizer ...', 'Snippet': 'The efficacy of a single vaccine dose against ‘symptomatic’ COVID-19 infection has been reported in large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as 52% (95%CI, 30 to 68%) from day 1 to 21 after a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 2 and 76% (95% CI, 59.3 to 95.9%) from day 22 to 90 after a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine ...', 'Full_text': 'Access Denied\n\nYour access to the NCBI website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov has been temporarily blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation involving your site.

In the omicron period, vaccine effectiveness against covid-19 requiring admission to hospital was 89% (95% confidence interval 88% to 90%) within two months after dose 3 but waned to 66% (63% to 68%) by four to five months. Vaccine effectiveness of three doses against emergency department or urgent care visits was 83% (82% to 84%) initially but waned to 46% (44% to 49%) by four to five months. Waning was evident in all subgroups, including young adults and individuals who were not immunocompromised; although waning was morein people who were immunocompromised. Vaccine effectiveness increased among most groups after a fourth dose in whom this booster was recommended.\n\nConclusions Effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against moderate and severe covid-19 waned with time after vaccination. The findings support recommendations for a booster dose after a primary series and consideration of additional booster doses.\n\nIntroduction\n\nRandomized trials of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines showed 94-95% protection against covid-19 among adults and suggested efficacy against covid-19 requiring hospital admission.12 Since the introduction of these vaccines in December 2020, evidence has accumulated that their effectiveness wanes over time since vaccination, especially against milder disease,3456789 they are less effective against omicron than earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants,10 and a third (booster) dose restores high effectiveness against severe disease.10111213 Although protection against severe omicron related disease is believed to be high for several months after a third dose, the durability of protection and how this effect can vary by age group, immunocompromised status, and vaccine product is uncertain. In March 2022, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended a second booster dose only for specific subgroups at high risk (such as adults aged 50 and older).14 A more complete understanding of the effectiveness and durability of third and fourth doses of the mRNA vaccines is important to inform policy about booster doses.\n\nThe CDC’s VISION network previously examined the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against admissions to hospital or emergency visits and urgent care visits associated with covid-19, with data from eight healthcare systems.15 In this article, we update VISION’s analyses of mRNA vaccine effectiveness, focusing on the durability of three and four dose protection against severe disease (ie, admission to hospital) during the omicron period. We assess the trajectory of vaccine effectiveness overall and in subgroups defined by age, immunocompromised status, and vaccine product.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design\n\nThe VISION network has been described previously.15 We applied a test negative design to estimate vaccine effectiveness of mRNA vaccines using retrospectively collected data. We focused on mRNA vaccines because they comprise more than 95% of covid vaccines administered in the US.16 Separate analyses were done of patients who were admitted to hospital (hospital sample) and patients who received care in an emergency department or urgent care clinic (emergency department or urgent care sample).\n\nStudy population and setting\n\nThe study population included adults (≥18 years) who received care for covid-like illness at a VISION network hospital or emergency department or urgent care center and had molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 at least 14 days after vaccines became locally available for their age group (17 January to 3 May 2021). The last contact included in this study period occurred on 12 July 2022. We excluded individuals who received any vaccine other than the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine, individuals who received more than four doses of an mRNA vaccine before the index medical contact, individuals who received only one dose of an mRNA vaccine less than 14 days before the index contact or who had a third or fourth dose less than seven days before the index contact, individuals known to have a positive laboratory test result for a SARS-CoV-2 infection more than 14 days before the index contact, and individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result but no diagnoses or symptoms suggesting covid-19 illness.\n\nVaccination status\n\nVaccination status was categorized by the number of doses received and the number of months between the most recent vaccine dose and the index contact date (referred to as time since vaccination). Patients were considered partially vaccinated if they received only one dose at least 14 days prior to the index contact date or had received a second dose less than 14 days previously. Patients with no record of vaccination before the index contact date were considered unvaccinated. Patients with three doses were those who received a third dose in a primary vaccination series (eg, among immunocompromised individuals) or a booster dose after a primary series of two doses. Aligning with recommendations for receipt of a fourth dose, we examined the effectiveness of four doses among adults aged 50 years or older and among immunocompromised adults of any age. Vaccination status was ascertained from immunization registries, electronic health records, and insurance claims.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was a positive or negative molecular SARS-CoV-2 result for a test done within 14 days before a medical contact to less than 72 h after among patients presenting with covid-like illness, as identified from ICD-9 and ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, ninth and 10th revision, respectively) diagnostic codes (supplemental methods; supplemental table S1). The index date for each contact was the earlier of either the contact date or the date of the closest SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. An individual could be included as a case once in the emergency department or urgent care sample and once in the hospital sample. Individuals could be included as a control multiple times.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe used a test negative case-control design in which cases were patients with covid-like illness with laboratory confirmed covid-19 and controls were patients with covid-like illness and negative SARS-CoV-2 test results (controls could have had positive test results for other respiratory viruses such as influenza). We compared cases with controls in the hospital sample, and separately compared cases with controls in the emergency or urgent care sample. Cases were not individually matched to controls.\n\nConditional logistic regression was used to examine case-control status in relation to vaccination status categorized as vaccinated with four, three, or two doses, or partially vaccinated; unvaccinated individuals were used as the reference group. To examine waning of vaccine effectiveness, we categorized people who were vaccinated using time specific indicators defined by two month intervals of time since vaccination; unvaccinated individuals were used as the reference group. We exponentiated the regression coefficient of each vaccination status indicator to yield an odds ratio, subtracted the odds ratio from 1 to estimate vaccine effectiveness, and multiplied by 100 to scale vaccine effectiveness as a percentage. In several analyses, a sparse bimonthly interval for which the vaccine effectiveness estimate had a confidence interval wider than 50 percentage points was combined with the previous bimonthly interval to provide a more precise estimate of vaccine effectiveness (see supplemental methods). Vaccine effectiveness estimates (and confidence limits) were scaled to a range of –100% to 100%.17\n\nLogistic regression models were conditioned by calendar week and geographical area such that we compared cases with controls tested during the same week in the same region (supplemental table S2). Covariates included in the models were those determined through bivariate analyses to be statistically significantly associated with both the outcome and vaccination status, as well as those specified a priori as established confounders, including age, race, ethnicity, presence of respiratory and non-respiratory comorbidities, immunocompromised status, and local viral circulation. Cubic splines were used for age, seven day average positivity of SARS-CoV-2 test in the area of the contact, and the propensity to be vaccinated; others were indicator variables. Propensity scores (supplemental methods) predicted vaccination (any versus none) based on demographics, comorbidities (supplemental table S3), and characteristics of the facility (supplemental table S4), and were derived independently for each period of variant dominance (supplemental table S5). Patients who were immunocompromised were identified by ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnostic codes (supplemental methods).18 We conducted separate analyses for three periods based on when a variant accounted for 50% or more of sequenced isolates in each site: before delta was predominant, when delta was predominant, and when omicron was predominant (supplemental table S6). We assessed the magnitude of waning as the difference in vaccine effectiveness between patients who had recently been vaccinated (defined as less than two months) and patients at a specified level of time since vaccination (eg, four to five months from dose 3), and we examined waning by age (18-44 years, 45-64 years, ≥65 years), vaccine product, and immunocompromised status. Bootstrapping was used to estimate a 95% confidence interval around the difference between vaccine effectiveness at less than two months and vaccine effectiveness at four to five months.\n\nWe conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we added to the study population patients with a known prior infection to assess the sensitivity of results to whether previously infected patients are included or excluded.. Second, we wanted to distinguish results between patients who had been admitted to hospital and patients who had been admitted to an emergency department or to urgent care. Therefore, we examined vaccine effectiveness in the emergency department or urgent care sample and omitted patients admitted to hospital within 30 days. Third, we investigated a negative control exposure19 by examining vaccine effectiveness in patients who received their first dose less than 14 days before the index date of contact. These patients were not expected to have substantial vaccine induced protection, and a vaccine effectiveness estimate substantially more than zero would be evidence of residual confounding.20\n\nAnalyses were conducted with SAS version 9.4 and R version 4.1.2. All confidence limits are 95% intervals. Confidence intervals excluding the null value were considered statistically significant.\n\nPatient and public involvement\n\nStudy participants contributed in important ways to this research by supplying the underlying data on which the study is based. It was not, however, feasible to involve them in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination of this study because the study was conducted under the CDC’s covid-19 incident response structure and limited to analysis of retrospectively collected electronic data only, with no patient interaction.\n\nResults\n\nStudy population\n\nFrom 17 January 2021 to 12 July 2022, 259 006 patients were admitted to 261 hospitals and 634 455 were admitted to 272 emergency departments or to 119 urgent care centers. The hospital sample included 17 446 people with covid-19 during the omicron period, 23 379 during the delta period, and 5078 before delta was dominant. The emergency department or urgent care sample included 57 174 people with covid-19 during the omicron period, 39 909 during the delta period, and 6204 before delta was dominant (table 1; supplementary figs S1-S18).\n\nView this table:\n\nIn the hospital sample, the median age was 69 years (interquartile range 56-79, 11.2% were black participants, 9.8% were Hispanic, and 23.3% had an immunocompromising condition. In the emergency department or urgent care sample, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range 33-69), 11.0% were black participants, 13.3% were Hispanic, and 4.5% had an immunocompromising condition (table 1). Characteristics by vaccination status are given in supplemental tables S7 and S8. Median times between the last vaccination date and index contact date in the hospital sample were 173 (interquartile range 97-248) days for two doses, 105 (56-156) days for three doses, and 33 (19-50) days for four doses, and in the emergency department or urgent care sample were 179 (110-247) days for two doses, 100 (52-155) days for three doses, and 34 (20-52) days for four doses.\n\nVaccine effectiveness\n\nVaccine effectiveness estimates from the hospital and emergency department or urgent care samples are shown in figures 1 and figure 2 and detailed in supplemental tables S9-S14.\n\nVaccine effectiveness against covid-19 requiring hospital admission was 94% (95% confidence interval 93% to 95%) in the pre-delta period and 96% (95% to 97%) in the delta period, during the initial two months after the second dose. By months four to five after the second dose, vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission decreased to 87% (77% to 93%) in the pre-delta period and 89% (88% to 90%) in the delta period. In the omicron period, two dose vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission was lower than in the earlier periods, both before and when delta was dominant, and waned more, decreasing from 73% (63% to 80%) initially to 57% (51% to 62%) by four to five, and to 40% (32% to 47%) by 12 months after the second dose.\n\nThe patterns of vaccine effectiveness estimates from the emergency department or urgent care sample were similar. Vaccine effectiveness of two doses against emergency department or urgent care visits was initially high in the pre-delta period (95%; 94% to 96%) and delta period (93%; 92% to 94%) and then waned. During the omicron period, vaccine effectiveness of two doses against emergency department or urgent care visits was lower initially (63%; 57% to 68%) than in the earlier pre-delta and delta periods and then waned more. From up to one month after the second dose to months four to five, the vaccine effectiveness of a second dose decreased by 9 percentage points (95% confidence interval 4 to 16) during the pre-delta period, by 7 percentage points (7 to 9) during the delta period, and by 26 percentage points (19 to 32) during the omicron period.\n\nA third dose initially restored high levels of protection against both hospital admissions and emergency department or urgent care visits, then began to wane. In the hospital sample, vaccine effectiveness of three doses was initially 96% (95% to 96%) during the delta period and 89% (88% to 90%) during the omicron period. Similarly, in the emergency department or urgent care sample, the vaccine effectiveness of a third dose was initially 96% (95% to 96%) during the delta period and 83% (82% to 84%) during the omicron period. Waning was evident in both samples by four to five months after the third dose during the omicron period, when vaccine effectiveness decreased to 66% (63% to 68%) against hospital admission and to 46% (44% to 49%) against emergency department or urgent care visits.\n\nVaccine effectiveness against hospital admission after a fourth dose increased to 72% (51% to 83%) in the 50-64 year group and to 76% (71% to 80%) in the 65 years and older age group (fig 3). Similarly, vaccine effectiveness against emergency department or urgent care visits after a fourth dose increased to 57% (47% to 65%) and 73% (69% to 76%) among the 50-64 year and 65 years and older age groups, respectively (supplemental table S14). Vaccine effectiveness of a fourth dose among immunocompromised individuals in the hospital sample was 48% (29% to 62%; fig 4), but we were unable to measure this precisely enough in the emergency department or urgent care sample.\n\nVaccine effectiveness in subgroups\n\nIn all subgroups examined, vaccine effectiveness waned as time elapsed after the second dose, increased markedly with a third dose, and waned as time elapsed (supplemental tables S9-14). Vaccine effectiveness also substantially improved after a fourth dose among most subgroups for whom this booster dose was recommended. Comparing the initial two months after the third dose with months four to five, vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission during the omicron period decreased by 33 percentage points (95% confidence interval 16 to 56) in the 18-44 years group, 31 (21 to 40) in the 45-64 years group, and 19 (16 to 22) in the 65 years or older group (fig 3,table 2). Results were similar in post hoc analyses that were restricted to individuals without immunocompromising conditions (supplemental table S15).\n\nView this table:\n\nVaccine effectiveness was higher in recipients of the mRNA-1273 than BNT162b2 vaccine in all three variant periods in both the hospital sample and the emergency department or urgent care sample. Vaccine effectiveness waned in recipients of both vaccine products. In the hospital sample during the omicron period, vaccine effectiveness of mRNA-1273 waned from 91% (89% to 92%) to 65% (60% to 70%) by four to five months after three doses whereas vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 waned from 88% (86% to 90%) to 66% (63% to 70%) after three doses (table 3).\n\nView this table:\n\nVaccine effectiveness after two and three doses was generally lower among individuals who were immunocompromised, in both the hospital and the emergency department or urgent care samples, in each period and at all times since vaccination (fig 4, table 4, supplemental tables S9-S14). In the omicron period, vaccine effectiveness of three doses against hospital admission waned from 78% (73% to 82%) to 48% (40% to 55%) by months four to five in the immunocompromised subgroup compared with 91% (90% to 92%) to 71% (68% to 74%) in the subgroup without immunocompromise (table 4).\n\nView this table:\n\nSensitivity analyses\n\nIn the first sensitivity analysis, vaccine effectiveness estimates in both samples were similar but slightly lower if patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were included (supplemental tables S16 and S17). In the second sensitivity analysis, vaccine effectiveness estimates were similar but lower if the emergency department or urgent care sample excluded patients who were later admitted to hospital. In the third sensitivity analysis, vaccine effectiveness ranged from –5% to 24% among patients whose index date for medical contact was less than 14 days after the first dose, consistent with the little protection induced by the vaccine during this two week period.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPrincipal findings\n\nProtection against severe omicron related covid-19 was high after three doses of an mRNA vaccine but began to wane less than six months after the third dose. In the hospital sample, vaccine effectiveness after a third doses was 89% among individuals within two months but decreased to 66% among individuals at four to five months. In the emergency department or urgent care sample, vaccine effectiveness of a third dose was 83% within two months but decreased to 46% at four to five months. In all subgroups defined by age, immunocompromised status, and vaccine product, the third dose was initially associated with markedly increased protection, but vaccine effectiveness was lower by four to five months. Vaccine effectiveness increased after a fourth dose for most subgroups for whom this booster dose is recommended in the US. Although we have not yet observed events more than four months from a fourth dose, our results suggest that protection after the fourth dose begins to wane after a few months.\n\nComparison with other studies\n\nOur vaccine effectiveness estimates for mRNA vaccines are broadly consistent with those in other reports: vaccine effectiveness was lower against the omicron variant than earlier variants,102122 vaccine effectiveness waned after a second dose,3456789 and a third dose restored high levels of protection against severe covid-19 during the omicron and delta periods.10111213 Our results are also consistent with other reports of waning protection after three mRNA doses.232425 As with others, we noted less waning against more severe outcomes,326 lower vaccine effectiveness among individuals who were immunocompromised,1727 and higher vaccine effectiveness among recipients of mRNA-1273 compared with recipients of BNT162b2.102324 We also observed improvement in vaccine effectiveness after a fourth dose.28\n\nStrengths and limitations of this study\n\nOne strength of our study is the number and diversity of sites and inclusion of outcomes of varying severity. Additionally, our sample size was large enough to detect modest waning of vaccine protection and to allow stratification of vaccine effectiveness estimates by immunocompromise status. We rigorously controlled for calendar time and geography such that cases were compared with controls tested during the same week in the same geographical area. This comparison allowed us to distinguish differences in vaccine effectiveness attributable to the waning of vaccine induced immunity from those attributable to the change in dominance of SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nOur study has limitations. First there is residual confounding if the timing of primary vaccination or booster doses was related to covid-19 risk in unmeasured ways (eg, mask use or occupation). However, we did not observe substantial vaccine protection in the two weeks after a first dose, which provides reassurance that residual confounding is limited. Second, although our test negative design is intended to avoid selection bias from healthcare seeking behavior, the design could induce selection bias arising from factors associated with a covid-like illness but not with covid-19. For example, inclusion of individuals who had influenza as controls could underestimate vaccine effectiveness due to the correlation between covid-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination. Because fewer than 5% of people in the control group in our study were positive for influenza, we expect this bias to be minimal. Also, we cannot rule out selection bias arising from reliance on clinician directed testing, although we note that almost all the patients admitted to hospital with covid-like illness were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Third, immunocompromised status was ascertained only from diagnostic codes at the time of medical contact (without data on prescriptions or laboratory tests), and we could not distinguish whether a third dose was in a primary series for people who were immunocompromised or was a booster dose. Insufficient adjustment for immunocompromised status might have biased vaccine effectiveness estimates downward, especially for those who were vaccinated and received a booster dose relatively early. However, we found waning protection in stratified analyses among both individuals who were immunocompromised and individuals who were not immunocompromised. Fourth, we did not have viral genomic sequence data. Fifth, although we excluded individuals with documented previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, our data might have missed many past infections. Sensitivity analyses that included people with known previous infections suggest that our vaccine effectiveness estimates would be higher if we could have ascertained and excluded everyone with protection induced by infection. Sixth. although we interpret our analyses of the hospital sample as pertaining to severe covid-19, some patients admitted to hospital could have tested positive for other reasons while being in hospital, especially during the omicron period.29 To address this, patients were not eligible for inclusion if they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result but no diagnoses suggesting a covid-19 infection. Seventh, although our sample includes enough outcome events to yield precise estimates of vaccine effectiveness for the overall adult population, estimates of vaccine effectiveness against admissions to hospital for covid-19 were less precise for younger adults and individuals who were immunocompromised owing to smaller sample sizes. Finally, we pooled data from heterogeneous populations in 10 US states; however, our findings might not be generalizable to other populations.\n\nPolicy implications\n\nTo evaluate the clinical significance of waning vaccine effectiveness, consideration of the absolute number of people admitted to hospital that would have been prevented had no waning occurred is helpful. However, this number depends on the background rate of severe covid-19, which sometimes varied 10-fold or more over several weeks. In this context, hospital admissions that would be prevented during an anticipated surge are an appropriate alternative. For example, the rate of hospital admissions related to covid-19 reached about 1500 per million unvaccinated adults each week in January 2022 in the US30; if incidence surges that high again, then for every million adults who lose 20 percentage points of vaccine protection, about 300 additional people each week (1500×0.20) will be admitted to hospital owing to covid-19 compared with no waning effect. During the omicron period, vaccine effectiveness waned within six months of the third dose by about 20 percentage points among those without immunocompromising conditions and by more than 40 percentage points among those with immunocompromising conditions. This amount of waning is enough to be relevant for clinical and policy considerations about the need for boosters or other protective measures. Combined with evidence of the safety and immunogenicity of an additional vaccine dose,313233 our findings lend support for consideration of additional doses beyond the primary series.\n\nConclusions\n\nProtection conferred by mRNA vaccines against moderate (emergency department or urgent care) and severe (hospital admission) covid-19 waned during the months after primary vaccination, increased substantially after the third dose, and waned again by four to five months. A fourth dose improved vaccine effectiveness among those for whom this booster dose was recommended. Vaccine effectiveness waned less against severe disease than against moderate disease. Vaccine effectiveness of either mRNA vaccine waned among adults of all ages. Among immunocompromised individuals, vaccine effectiveness was lower and waning was more noticeable. These findings support recommendations for a third vaccine dose and consideration of additional booster doses.\n\nWhat is already known on this topic\n\nStudies of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) covid-19 vaccines suggest that their effectiveness decreases over time and increases with an additional dose\n\nHow this pattern has varied with the dominant variant and number of vaccine doses, or by age group, immunocompromise status, and vaccine product is, however, not known\n\nWhat this study adds\n\nAmong US adults of all ages, protection provided by either mRNA vaccine against moderate and severe covid-19 waned after primary vaccination, increased markedly after a third dose, and then waned again by four to five months after a third dose\n\nVaccine effectiveness diminished less against severe disease than against moderate disease\n\nA fourth dose improved vaccine effectiveness among most subgroups for whom it was recommended; overall, our findings support recommendations for broad use of booster doses\n\nEthics statements\n\nEthical approval\n\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board of Westat.\n\nData availability statement\n\nNo additional data available.\n\nFootnotes\n\nContributors: All authors contributed to the design of the study.

The mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and the BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine have both proven highly effective in preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death from Covid-19. However, data suggest that the humoral antibody response to the vaccines differs, with two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine providing significantly higher humoral antibody response compared with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine in both uninfected and previously infected individuals across all age categories1. This is clinically relevant as several studies have demonstrated that higher humoral antibody responses correlate with enhanced protection against Covid-192.\n\nData also suggest that infection rates follow the same trend as the humoral antibody response. Observational data incorporating cases of Delta VOC have suggested a higher rate of infection in individuals immunized with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine compared with two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, suggesting that the real-world performance of the vaccines may differ from one another3.\n\nWe therefore conducted a retrospective cohort study that examined the incidence and severity of Covid-19 infections as a function of the time from vaccination in over 3.5 million individuals across the United States who were fully vaccinated via either the mRNA-1273 or the BNT162b2 vaccine, including over 8800 infections; see Fig. 1. Understanding the clinical performance of each vaccine is critically important to determine the comparative effectiveness of the vaccines.\n\nOur primary outcome is the rate of Covid-19 infection occurring at 30, 60, and 90 days at least 14 days after the second dose of either the mRNA-1273 vaccine or the BNT162b2 vaccine.\n\nIn a population of over 3.5 million fully vaccinated individuals, 8848 experienced documented Covid-19 infections. Of those, 3090 (35%) received mRNA-1273 and 5758 (65%) received BNT162b2 (Table 1 and Fig. 1).\n\nMedian age and prevalence of many comorbid conditions were similar across groups considered (Table 1). Models for the seven negative outcomes, included to assure there were no unaccounted-for differences between groups receiving BNT162b and mRNA-1273, exhibited negligible mean bias arising from systemic errors (Table S3).\n\nKaplan–Meier curves report that the estimated time to infection and time to severe negative outcomes defined as any hospitalization, ICU admission, death, or discharge to hospice, whichever occurs first, are reported in Fig. 2. In the raw data, a statistically significant difference (p-value < 0.001) with a diverging trend over time is observed between BNT162b and mRNA-1273 (Fig. 2C). This difference persists in the PH model-based predictions for a general patient (Fig. 2A). There are no statistically significant differences between the predicted probabilities of the two vaccines (Fig. 2B, D) for the composite outcome of hospitalization, ICU admission, death, or transfer to hospice.\n\nAdjusted odds ratios for likelihood of infection 30, 60, and 90 days post vaccination (14 days after the second dose) show that the mRNA-1273 vaccine is associated with lower odds of infection. For the unadjusted model with IPTW as sampling weights, the NNV to observe this difference ranges from 1,047 over 30 days to 290 over 90 days (Fig. 3), signaling superior mRNA-1273 vaccine effects over time in reducing the likelihood of infection. This difference is consistent across all the models considered. However, for severe adverse outcomes (ICU admission, composite ICU admission/death/referral to hospice, or composite hospitalization/ICU admission/death/referral to hospice), while events are rare, no statistically significant differences between the two vaccines were observed (Fig. S4–6). As shown in Fig. 4, time-to-event analysis assuming right censoring, was performed and provided similar results to the binary outcome results for different model specifications, including for outcomes of infection (aHR 0.69, 95% CI (0.66, 0.72)), composite ICU admission/death/referral to hospice (aHR 0.76, 95% CI (0.50, 1.16)), and composite hospitalization/ICU admission/death/referral to hospice (aHR 0.67, 95% CI (0.51, 0.89)). Risk differences between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 for both infection and composite outcomes increase over time (Fig. 4b), this observation is in alignment with the binary outcome results (Fig. 3).\n\nWe further considered time-to-event analyses among all those experiencing infections in our sample for ICU admission, composite ICU admission/death/referral to hospice, and composite hospitalization/ICU admission/death/referral to hospice. No statistically significant differences between vaccines were observed for adverse composite outcomes (Figs. S12–14).\n\nThe results are similar for the stratified analyses of (1) including only patients with no prior diagnosis of Covid-19 (Fig. S11), (2) including only patients who are aged 65 or older (Fig. S9), and (3) including only patients who are aged 64 and younger (Fig. S10). Since the population considered is different in each model, between-model comparisons are not valid, however, both models show directionally the same results.\n\nIt is known that certain comorbidities worsen prognosis in an unvaccinated population. Our models indicate that in a vaccinated population, congestive heart failure (aHR 1.52, 95% CI (1.03, 2.26)), hypertension (aHR 2.17, 95% CI (1.30, 3.62)), and lymphoma (aHR 7.03, 95% CI (4.31,11.47)) increase the likelihood of experiencing the composite adverse event of hospitalization, ICU admission, or death/ transfer to hospice. This difference persisted even after adjusting for which vaccine a person received, sociodemographic variables, transfer from nursing facility, timing of vaccination, place of residence, and historical comorbidities (Fig. S7).\n\nMultiple studies have shown that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated individuals has increased over the last year. This increase may be related to the higher transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron VOC and/or the potential contribution of waning immunity post vaccination. These data underscore the need to understand the comparative effectiveness of the available vaccines.\n\nTwo important questions must be answered to address the comparative effectiveness of the BNT162b and mRNA-1273 vaccines. The first is whether each vaccine is equivalent in its ability to prevent severe disease from Covid-19. The data available from our large population of patients suggest that at 90 days out from vaccination, there is no significant difference between BNT162b and mRNA-1273 in terms of the risk of the composite outcome of hospitalization, ICU admission, or death/transfer to hospice (aOR [95% confidence interval]: 1.23 [0.67, 2.25], Fig. S6). We analyzed data both from a binary and time-to-event outcome point of view, each quantifying the association between patient outcomes and vaccine types with different model specifications. Conclusions remain similar, irrespective of modeling framework, highlighting the robustness of our methods. The second question is whether there is a higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the BNT162b vaccine compared with the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and here there is a statistically significant difference in favor of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. This difference appears very early post vaccination and increases over time. The NNV with the mRNA-1273 vaccine compared with the BNT162b vaccine to prevent one case of SARS-CoV-2 is 1047 at thirty days post vaccination (aOR [95% CI]: 0.67 [0.63, 0.71]), but is 290 at ninety days post vaccination (aOR [95% CI]: 0.66 [0.60, 0.73]). Although this incremental risk is small at the individual level, it is meaningful at the population level. Our results suggest that for every 1 million individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b vaccine compared with the mRNA-1273 vaccine, this would represent 3,448 additional care-seeking cases of Covid-19 at 90 days.\n\nDelta infection was of very low prevalence when these data were collected, and therefore unlikely affected our comparative effectiveness results. However, as new VOCs emerge, each of these may have unique characteristics that would impact their ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity. Periodic updates to this analysis will allow us to track the comparative effectiveness of mRNA-1273 and BNT162B in the setting of the emergence of new VOCs, including Delta and Omicron.\n\nThis study has limitations. First, the analysis is restricted to commercially insured and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries from a single U.S. insurer, a group that is unevenly distributed across the United States geographically and demographically. Nevertheless, this study reflects a large and comprehensive sample of U.S. vaccinations. Second, we are unable to measure SARS-CoV-2 infection that is not apparent in medical claims or via laboratory testing, which likely results in an overestimate of the vaccines’ protective effects. This includes the fact that our “time-to-infection” represents date of infection from our data (positive PCR test, or ICD-10 code of U07.1 in claims), rather than the date on which SARS-CoV-2 was contracted. Notably, asymptomatic or mild disease for which an individual did not seek care are not captured. However, serious adverse events, which pose the most strain on the healthcare system and for individuals, are reliably observable in our data and are less affected by diagnosis-dependent biases over time. Finally, we do not include an analysis accounting for calendar time as a proxy to infer the likely variant of infection as this additional confounder would further complicate already-nuanced results. While not undertaken here, further study to understand the relative effectiveness against all variants of concern is needed and will be conducted when our data on infection with Delta and Omicron are more complete. Basic counts are included in Table S8.\n\nThis study also has strengths. It represents a geographically and sociodemographically diverse group of 3,966,004 patients, allowing confidence in the estimation of individual-level patient factors associated with documented breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection and the resulting serious adverse events.\n\nThe incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this large cohort of individuals post full vaccination with mRNA-1273 or BNT162b suggests that the effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 vaccine exceeds that of the BNT162b vaccine by a small margin. However, both vaccines compared equally with respect to the incidence of severe disease at 90 days defined by hospitalization, ICU admission, discharge to hospice, or death (Fig. S6; aOR 1.23, 95% CI (0.67, 2.25)).\n\nThis paper follows STROBE reporting guidelines for cohort studies. This study was deemed exempt from institutional board review by the UnitedHealth Group Office of Human Research Affairs due to using deidentified retrospective data.\n\nData sources\n\nWe used administrative deidentified claims for Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals in a research database, including vaccination status through May 31, 2021. This study was reviewed and deemed exempt by the institutional review board of UnitedHealth Group.\n\nPopulation\n\nStarting with all Medicare Advantage or commercial enrollees 18 years or older vaccinated after emergency-use authorization (EUA) for either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 who were fully vaccinated (received their second dose with 14 days of additional observation) on or before May 31, 2021. Those who received a second dose earlier than EUA-approved timeframe (21 days for BNT162b2 and 28 days for mRNA-1273) or more than 42 days after their first dose were excluded from analyses. We then required valid zip-code information and excluded any patients who experienced a Covid-related event (ICD-10 code U07.1 in inpatient or outpatient setting or positive PCR laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2) within 13 days of their second dose and none after “full vaccination,” which is considered 14 days after the second dose, to eliminate those whose infections occurred before they were fully vaccinated (Fig. 1). For subsequent analyses, we subdivided this group into those who had at least 30, 60, and 90 days of follow-up observation. In the supplementary information, we also look in particular at the subset of 8848 fully vaccinated individuals who became infected with Covid-19 (identified either by a positive PCR test or ICD-10 code U07.1, including ER, outpatient, and inpatient hospital visits).\n\nOutcome measure\n\nOur main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection identified either by a positive PCR test or Covid-19 ICD-10 code U07.1 in claims, including ER, outpatient, and inpatient hospital visits. We define this as a “care-seeking” population. We also considered ICU admission, hospital admission, and the composite of either inpatient mortality or discharge to hospice within 30, 60, and 90 days of initial admission for Covid-19. We considered this composite measure a more complete representation of the outcome of interest than mortality alone as it reflects an outcome closer to any-site mortality, and given known racial differences in hospice use4.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nBinary outcomes such as SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admission, composite outcomes such as ICU, death, or hospice transfer with and without hospitalization that occurred within 30-, 60-, and 90 days post vaccination were considered. A series of multivariable logistic regressions4 were performed to estimate the odds of experiencing events for those vaccinated with mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 adjusting for risk factors (demographic, nursing facility admission source, socioeconomic status (SES) index, comorbidities, time of vaccination, residence by state, prior Covid diagnosis, and urban/rural location). To mitigate any potential selection bias, sample propensity scores, signaling conditional probability of receiving mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, were estimated via multivariable generalized linear model with logit link function and inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) were calculated using stabilization5,6. Both weighted univariate and multivariable logistic regressions7,8,9,10,11,12 were performed to validate the results of unweighted samples. As a sensitivity, propensity-score subclassification models were fitted with respect to quintiles of the estimated propensity scores13,14.\n\nKaplan–Meier analysis was performed for time-to-infection and time-to-composite outcomes for individuals fully vaccinated by June 1, 2021; log-rank-based p-values were provided. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard (PH) models15 were fitted with and without IPTWs. We performed three-sensitivity analyses by (a) stratifying data for vaccinated individuals aged 65 and above, (b) stratifying data for vaccinated individuals under age 65, and (c) excluding patients with a history of any prior Covid-19 diagnoses before complete vaccination. PH model-based predictions of experiencing events for a mRNA-1273- and a BNT162b2-vaccinated individual were provided.\n\nWeighted standardized mean differences and statistical significance tests based on weighted regressions16 were used to check balances within measured covariates. Standard errors of the parameters were estimated by robust sandwich covariance estimators for all models. Mean predicted marginal probabilities (risk) were calculated via “recycled” predictions17,18,19, assuming everyone in the sample received each vaccine, then multiplied by 1000 to convert to predicted marginal risk per 1000 individuals, and number needed to vaccinate (NNV) was obtained with respect to absolute risk differences based on each model19,20.\n\nAs sensitivity, we reported “E-values”21 to assess the magnitude of unmeasured confounding. Summary measures22 to determine the strength of selection bias were provided for main outcomes of interest. Multivariable generalized linear models with respect to seven negative-control outcomes were fitted and empirical null distribution of systematic error was used to quantify the mean of bias23,24. All statistical tests were two-sided, with a significance level of 5%. All analyses were conducted using R, version 3.6.325.

For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10067885/', 'Headline': 'The shift of percent excess mortality from zero-COVID policy to living ...', 'Snippet': 'Besides COVID-associated deaths, there might also be non-negligible deaths due to insufficient medical resources during the pandemic, which are not included in the statistics of COVID-19 deaths .

From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/', 'Headline': ""What is China's zero-COVID policy and how does it work?"", 'Snippet': 'Nearly three years into the pandemic, China is sticking with a strict COVID-19 containment policy that has caused mounting economic damage and widespread frustration, while keeping its borders ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25433800-100-zero-covid-strategies-are-being-ditched-but-they-were-the-best-option/', 'Headline': 'Zero-covid strategies are being ditched, but they were the best option', 'Snippet': 'Countries that followed the zero-covid playbook have done better on every measure, from death rates to economic growth.

One of the biggest shifts has been the abandonment of the “zero covid” strategy by countries like New Zealand and Vietnam, which are opening up and allowing the virus to spread.\n\nAs a result, it is tempting to think the approach was a mistake and that the strategy of nations like the UK has won out. But that is nonsense. Countries that followed the zero-covid playbook have done better on every measure, from death rates to economic growth. If more nations had implemented this approach, humanity would be in a better place. When the next pandemic emerges, governments should consider trying to eliminate it using zero-covid methods.\n\nThere is no single definition of a zero-covid strategy, but it generally means reducing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus as much as possible. This typically entails a rapid lockdown once the virus is detected in the community, followed by reopening once cases have fallen, combined with a robust system for testing, tracing chains of infection and supporting those who need to self-isolate.\n\nThe most obvious benefit is that far fewer people die. As of 18 March, New Zealand had seen 151 confirmed deaths from covid-19, or 0.003 per cent of its population – even though the virus repeatedly snuck into the country. In contrast, more than 164,000 people are confirmed to have died in the UK, which is 0.24 per cent of the population.\n\nZero-covid policies also cause less economic harm. When the virus is barely present, people feel confident going out, so the economy can reopen more fully. There is an economic cost to the initial lockdown, but many nations that allowed the virus to spread have also had lockdowns to save their health systems and so paid the same costs – and their lockdowns were often longer. A 2021 study found there was greater economic growth in zero-covid countries than in those that let the virus spread. The one big downside is that maintaining border controls hurt trade and tourism. But overall, zero-covid nations did better economically.\n\nAlthough zero covid was a successful strategy for countries like New Zealand, they are now abandoning it. A key factor has been the evolution of the virus. The delta variant was far more transmissible than the original virus, and the newer omicron variant is more transmissible still. These new variants can only be halted by truly draconian measures, so governments that previously banked on elimination have been forced to let the virus in.\n\nIf the target of zero covid is now being ditched, does that mean it was a failure? A crude answer would be: only if you think saving lives and preserving economic growth constitutes a misstep.\n\nLet’s go further. Consider what would have happened if, in early 2020, every country able to had adopted a zero-covid policy. It is incontestable that the global death count would be far lower, fewer people would have long covid and the economic damage would have been reduced. The virus would still be spreading, but slowly, and rising rates of vaccination would control it further. Crucially, omicron probably wouldn’t have had the chance to evolve.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, governments like the UK’s asserted that eliminating the virus was utterly impractical and so it was necessary to let it pass through the population in a “controlled” manner. Two years on, we know that was wrong.\n\nWhen the next pandemic emerges – as it will – governments should remember zero covid, and work together to eliminate the new threat if they feasibly can. Coordinated international action is hard, but we must learn to do it.\n\nMichael Marshall is a science writer in Devon, UK, and author of The Genesis Quest'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262407922005693', 'Headline': 'Zero doubts - ScienceDirect', 'Snippet': 'Zero-covid policies also cause less economic harm.

The intricate interconnections among the seventeen SDGs further compound their complexity11,12,13,14,15. The pandemic has had apparent impacts on various aspects of the SDGs, including the economy16,17, health18,19,20, reduced inequality17,21, agriculture and food22,23,24, education25, the environment26,27,28,29, and social justice30. However, the focus of studies on the impacts of COVID-19 has been on individual or a few SDGs, and most of them have lacked a systematic approach to assess pandemic impacts on all SDGs from the scale of countries to regions and the globe4,9. This hinders the development of more effective and targeted investment to reverse the setbacks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTherefore, we aim to quantify the impacts of the pandemic on the progress towards each SDG by 2030 for each of the 163 countries that have recorded their progress thus far. It will help us understand how progress towards the SDGs was retarded by the pandemic at the global and regional scales, as well as in countries at different levels of economic development. In this regard, we establish an approach that reconstructs the entire process of the SDGs in response to COVID-19 impacts, as described in Fig. 1.\n\nWe assume that the COVID-19 impacts on the SDGs are induced by the shocks that are represented by the initial disturbances caused by COVID-19, largely in terms of increased mortality and morbidity, economies and activities slowed by lockdowns, and depleted public resources. The COVID-19 impact on every SDG in each country is a combined effect of shock loss and growth delay loss, as shown in Fig. 1. We obtain the shock loss for every SDG in each country by applying the country’s status to adjust the nominal impacts on each SDG, which reflects general perceptions of the direct impacts of COVID-19 shocks on the basis of the extensive literature related to COVID-19 impacts on each SDG indicator and indirect impacts caused by cascading effects due to interconnections among the SDGs. A country’s status includes what each country has achieved in terms of SDG progress before the pandemic and covers COVID-19 severity in each country and the country’s ability to respond to COVID-19 shocks measured on the impact severity index provided in the Global COVID-19 Index (GCI)31. The interconnections are quantified by a matrix among 17 SDGs represented by 92 indicators from 2000 to 2019, for a total of 3933 indicator pairs for all 193 UN member countries. We estimate the growth delay loss for every SDG in each country by considering the deceleration and then recovery of SDG progress, which depends on the resilience of each country in recovering from COVID-19 impacts represented by both the GCI Recovery Index and Severity Index31. The impact of COVID-19 on global, regional and national progress towards every SDG is then measured by a population-weighted aggregation of shock loss and growth delay loss in each country.\n\nGiven both changes and the pre-COVID-19 gap in meeting the SDGs, we finally evaluate the post-COVID-19 risk of countries failing to achieve their SDGs by 2030 in association with the income groups to which their economies are assigned, as defined by the World Bank32. More details about the approach and relevant data can be found in the Methods and Supplementary Data 1.\n\nThe findings have shown that the progress towards achieving the SDGs has been greatly impeded, not only by the direct impact, but also more by the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. They also highlight the different risk profiles among countries at different income levels, in addition to substantial regional differences. This provides a basis for international bodies (e.g. United Nations), government, and all relevant decision-makers, as well as researchers to use the application of the methodological process to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on SDG progress at global, regional, and national scales so they can identify options and address the development gaps, most importantly, recover from the impacts, and advance the 2030 SDG agenda.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts on global progress towards the SDGs by 2030\n\nFirst, we define the nominal direct impacts representing the perceptions of the direct consequences of COVID-19 shocks acting on specific SDGs via the impact paths, as shown in Fig. 2 (More details see the Methods). As a result, we find that the COVID-19 shocks adversely impacted 13 of the 17 SDGs via approximately ten paths. Among them, the goals of eradicating poverty (SDG 1), achieving zero hunger (SDG 2), good health and well-being (SDG 3), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) and reduced inequality (SDG 10) are the top five that received the greatest direct impacts.\n\nRegardless of the immediate benefit of strengthening climate action (SDG 13) due to reduced economic activities, COVID-19 has generally had negative impacts on all other SDGs to various degrees (Fig. 2). The pandemic has generally been understood not only as a health emergency but also as a socioeconomic crisis. Additionally, COVID-19 has compromised the development of the SDGs in three main ways: restricted activities, slowed economies, and reduced investment in areas other than health systems. Nevertheless, approximately 26% of the targets in SDGs 2, 3, 7, 9, and 11–17 presented immediate opportunities through reduced environmental impacts, increasing demand for technology, and enhanced international assistance, in addition to more investment in healthcare.\n\nThe nominal indirect impacts induced by the cascading effects of COVID-19 on the 17 SDGs through their interconnections are estimated and represented by Fig. 3 (see more details in Methods). The indirect impacts are most severe on SDGs 1 (no poverty), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), 7 (affordable and clean energy), and 11 (sustainable cities and communities), with effects up to more than thirty times greater than the direct impacts on average.\n\nOverall, the nominal indirect impacts are seven times greater than the nominal direct impacts on average, highlighting the hidden ramifications of the pandemic. Interestingly, the main causes of the nominal indirect impacts on the SDGs, are the COVID-19 shocks on SDGs 3 (good health and well-being) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). It is particularly evident for the six goals, SDGs 1, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 11. The average nominal indirect impact of SDGs 3 and 6 on those six goals is approximately seven times more than the average from all of the goals. Some SDGs, such as responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), climate action (SDG 13) and life below water (SDG 14), are related to environmental protection.It is worth noting that these goals often act in trade-offs with other development goals12,13. While COVID-19 generally produced negative impacts on the SDGs, it simultaneously had positive indirect effects on some goals, such as SDGs 12 and 13.\n\nThe shock loss of each country’s progress towards every SDG is then estimated by adjusting the nominal impact, and the growth delay loss during recovery is also evaluated (see Methods). The beneficial effects of COVID-19 impacts on SDGs 12, 13 and 14 were largely relinquished during the recovery9,10,33,34. Therefore, it is assumed that the progress towards those SDGs resumed after the shocks, and this progress would hardly be affected. As a result, they are not included in the impact analysis.\n\nBy aggregating the shock loss and growth delay loss of all countries weighted by their population, the degree of COVID-19 impacts on global progress towards the SDGs can then be described as shown in Fig. 4. The goal of no poverty (SDG 1) is considered to be the most affected, as it has the highest direct and indirect shock loss as well as growth delay loss second only to that of SDG 9. The main reason is that COVID-19 threatens to increase extreme poverty (i.e., SDG 1.1 and 1.2) in many countries which mainly due to economic lockdown caused by the pandemic35, and the high level of connectivity that exists with other goals exacerbates the knock-on effects12, as well as delaying progress towards SDG 1 that had been going well prior to the pandemic35. The next most impacted is the goal of industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), followed by sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), quality education (SDG 4), strong institutions (SDG 16), good health and well-being (SDG 3), and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7). Noticeably, the impacts on SDGs 4, 7, 9 and 11 are high, in contrast with the view that the impacts on them would be mixed or moderate35.\n\nThe results highlight that the cascading effects amplify the shock loss at the global scale, as the indirect shock loss is almost eight times greater than the direct shock loss. The goal that experienced the highest indirect impacts is SDG 1, followed by SDGs 4, 3, 7 and 11, which are highly interconnected with other goals. The results also reveal that SDG 9 incurred the most growth delay loss. This finding implies that reduced resources and investment for the sake of overcoming COVID-19 impacts may have taken a considerable toll, especially for SDGs that were progressing rapidly before the pandemic35. It may be caused by the fact that they require a large commitment to maintain the trend or lose momentum. This also happened to some extent to SDGs 1, 8, and 2. Therefore, redirecting resources and investment back to the implementation of those SDGs is essential if better recovery is desired in order to meet the goals by 2030.\n\nOverall, the results highlight considerable hidden impacts on the development of the SDGs beyond the apparent effects. This suggests that the COVID-19 impacts on global progress towards the SDGs can be significantly underestimated if the growth delay loss and indirect shock loss induced by the cascading effects are ignored.\n\nHowever, the results also show that the cascading effect could also have indirect benefits for the SDGs, such as responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), climate change (SDG 13), and life below water (SDG 14). Considering that the beneficial effects of COVID-19 impacts on SDGs 12, 13 and 14 were relinquished during recovery9,10,33,34, they are not considered in the analysis of growth delay loss.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts on regional progress towards the SDGs by 2030\n\nWe represent the change due to COVID-19 shocks as the indicative progress loss (i.e., the proportion of the total progress loss to what would have been achieved by 2030) and spatially map the change in SDG progress by region. We then categorize them as impacts of COVID-19 at five levels, as shown in Fig. 5 (more information is provided in Methods). We find that regions with overall impacts above the medium level include Latin America and the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. It is primarily due to that there are most countries in these regions that have less coping capacity, and are more vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-1936. The impacts in these regions are in the range of 1.5 to 1.9 times those in East Asia and the Pacific, which are the least affected34,35,37. Approximately 81% of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa incurred impacts above the medium level. Countries highly impacted in other regions include Colombia, Georgia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In fact, there is no country in which progress towards the SDGs was immune to COVID-19 impacts. It is envisaged that that progress towards the SDGs in 62% of countries would experience medium to high impacts of the pandemic.\n\nMore specifically, progress towards SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) was mostly impacted, and it received almost twice the average impacts of COVID-19 on all other SDGs, followed by SDGs 11, 16 and 3. This is even more evident in the regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. This is because SDG 9 was underperforming in these regions even before COVID-19, such as the low population using the Internet (SDG 9.1) and low R&D expenditures (SDG 9.6).The decline in industrial output, as well as bankruptcy and closure of some industries due to the pandemic may further exacerbated the situation35. In addition, it is worth noting that progress towards SDG 1 in Sub-Saharan Africa and towards SDGs 3, 10, 11, and 16 in Latin America and the Caribbean were also highly impacted. Compared to other regions, progress towards those goals in approximately 79% of Latin America and Caribbean countries was impacted at a level no less than moderate.\n\nAdditionally, the findings show that, in comparison to the total consequences, the average direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on progress toward the SDGs for all areas were relatively low (see Fig. 5). However, for all regions, the average indirect impacts were more than twenty times greater than the average direct impacts. Latin America and the Caribbean experienced higher average indirect effects than other regions. They were subject to an average indirect effect approximately three times higher than one in East Asia and the Pacific, which was the least affected region. One reason is that, for Latin America and the Caribbean, the main positive correlation between SDGs in most countries greatly exacerbates the chain reaction of negative effects of the pandemic12. The indirect impacts of COVID-19 on progress towards SDGs 1, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 11 in Latin American and Caribbean countries and North America were at least moderate. Especially for SDG 1, as well as for Europe and Central Asia and the Middle East and North Africa, the degree of indirect impacts was demonstrated to be least moderate. In addition, Europe and Central Asia experienced at least moderate indirect effects on SDGs 3 and 4.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts on national progress and risks of countries to achieve the SDGs by 2030 after COVID-19\n\nAmong the income groups, for countries with income levels from high to low, COVID-19 generally had increasing impacts on the progress towards the SDGs by 2030 (see Supplementary Fig. 4 and more details in Methods). LICs (low-income countries) were the most affected, with average impacts that were around 1.4 times greater than those in high-income countries. About 84% of LICs were affected above the medium level, i.e. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. However, SDG 17 in HICs (high-income countries) was affected by COVID-19 almost 1.4 times more than in LICs. Notably, COVID-19 had moderate or greater effects on SDGs 3 and 9 for all four income categories. Besides, SDG 7 and 11 in poorer countries (i.e. low and lower-middle-income countries) and SDG16 in richer countries (i.e. high and upper-middle-income countries) both suffered medium and above impacts by COVID-19. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the average direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on progress toward the SDGs for all income levels were rather small. The average indirect effects, however, were more than twenty-four times bigger than the average direct effects across all income levels. Furthermore, the indirect impacts of COVID-19 on HIC’s progress towards SDG 1 and 3 were no less than moderate.\n\nFor a country, the risk of failing to achieve the SDGs by 2030 after COVID-19 is considered to be dependent on the expected progress gap in meeting the SDGs by 2030 prior to COVID-19 as well as the indicative progress loss, as previously described. To measure the relative loss of SDG progress among countries, we normalize the indicative progress loss by applying the standard score (see more details in Methods). The risk is then categorized into high/medium/low on the basis of the expected progress gap prior to COVID-19 and the standard score of the post-COVID-19 indicative loss, as shown in Fig. 6.\n\nDistinctly, the post-COVID-19 risks of national progress towards the SDGs differ by the four income groups. Notably, for countries with income levels from high to low, there are an increasing number of SDGs that could not be achieved with the increasing expected pre-COVID-19 gap by 2030. The same trend, as shown by the number of SDGs with a standard score above zero, manifests again in the progress towards the SDGs experiencing even more setbacks in poorer countries (i.e., low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs)) than in richer countries (i.e., high-income countries (HICs) and upper-middle-income countries (UMICs)) in the post-COVID-19 period.\n\nOverall, as displayed by the dotted envelops in Fig. 6, HICs (e.g., New Zealand and Australia) had made good progress towards achieving the SDGs before COVID-19 and were little affected by the pandemic, thus demonstrate that they would have low risks in achieving the SDGs by 2030. In comparison, the progress made in UMICs (e.g., Thailand and China) before the pandemic was not balanced but was relatively less affected by the pandemic. In LMICs (e.g., Georgia and Moldova), the impacts of the pandemic started to take effect on top of unbalanced progress before the pandemic. LICs (e.g., Ethiopia and Burkina Faso) were mostly disadvantaged by both large gaps in progress before the pandemic and considerable impacts afterwards. This is mainly because poor countries lack public spending and access to capital markets to recover quickly and move the SDG progress forward34,35,38.\n\nMore specifically, the risk in HICs is low for most of the SDGs. Only SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) falls to a medium level, which was indeed a concern even before the pandemic35,39,40. Affected slightly more than the average by COVID-19 are SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), but their well-advanced status (or smaller gap) prior to COVID-19 ensures that they maintain their low-risk status.\n\nIn UMICs, SDG 10 stands out in the category of high risk, which was already causing concern before COVID-1935,39,40. However, the impact of COVID-19 on SDG 10 is below the average, implying that it is more an ongoing issue than a ramification of COVID-19. The situation is similar for SDG 15 (life on land) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals), which are at a medium risk level. In addition, SDGs 9 (industry innovation and infrastructure) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) experience medium risk and are more affected by COVID-19.\n\nLMICs had generally made good progress towards SDGs 1 (eradicate poverty), 4 (quality education) and 8 (decent work and economic growth) before the pandemic, and their progress has been less affected by COVID-19. However, most SDGs in those countries are expected to experience risks ranging from medium to high levels owing to a lack of progress even before the pandemic, especially for SDG 5 (gender equality). In addition, progress towards SDG 9 suffers from both a lack of progress before COVID-19 and considerable impacts of the pandemic, leading to high risk.\n\nIt is important to note that progress towards the SDGs in LICs generally encountered major lags even before COVID-19, and the lags have been exacerbated by the impacts of COVID-19. This has caused the risks to range from middle to high levels. It is a particular concern that there is a high risk of failing to achieve SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), while the SDGs associated with people’s basic needs, such as SDGs 1 and 3, also experience risks at the high end of the medium level.\n\nOur study provides new insights into impacts on global, regional and national progress towards the SDGs following the shocks of COVID-19, which include the increased mortality and morbidity caused by the pandemic outbreak, economies and activities slowed by lockdowns, and depleted public resources. The impacts innovatively capture both direct and indirect effects as well as immediate setback and deceleration in progress towards achieving the SDGs by 2030.\n\nThe impacts on global progress towards the 17 SDGs as a result of COVID-19 are mostly consistent with the results of other studies that found that SDG 1 was the most affected9,35. More important, our study further manifests the significance of growth delay loss and indirect or cascading shock loss due to interlinkages among the SDGs. Noticeably, the impacts on SDG 9 became more prominent due to its having the highest growth delay loss. It implies that the SDGs that were rapidly progressing before the pandemic can be considerably impacted during the recovery, as the resources and investment critical to maintaining their momentum were redirected to overcome the pandemic. Consequently, more efforts or investment will be required to rebuild them.\n\nThe findings indicate that the progress toward achieving the SDGs is greatly hampered by the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results highlight SDGs 3 and 16 are key goals that have strong interlinkages with many other goals, and changes in them can magnify the overall impact by cascading effects on other goals, as shown in Fig. 3. A general risk management approach to mitigating the global impacts of COVID-19 is to directly reduce the shocks by improving public health measures. In combination with more measured lockdowns and effective public resource use, it can reduce the mortality and morbidity. Having said that, more targeted measures to reduce the immediate direct impacts of COVID-19 on SDGs 3 and 16 could considerably alleviate the indirect impacts. Additionally, the focus on peace, justice and strong institutions in SDG 16 can also broadly benefit the implementation of all other SDGs when facing COVID-19 shocks.\n\nThe impacts also demonstrate regional differences. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa were more severely affected. Therefore, to reduce COVID-19 impacts, there is a strong need to improve their resilience in general, such as health system capacity specific to COVID-19 and relevant institutional and infrastructure capacities36. It is particularly important to foster industry innovation and build resilient infrastructures in SDG 9, as the pandemic severely impacted development in the regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition, the goal for poverty reduction in SDG 1 was highly affected by COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa, which is in alignment with the conclusions of other research41. There are more concern that the progress towards SDG 1 in the region had fallen behind prior to the pandemic (see Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, more financial and technical support is urgently required to enhance the chance of the region to meet the goal of poverty reduction by 2030. In comparison, the region of Latin America and the Caribbean received the most impacts on its progress towards fostering industry, innovation and infrastructure in SDG 9; ensuring healthy lives and well-being in SDG 3; reducing inequality in SDG 10; promoting sustainable cities and communities in SDG 11; and strengthening peace, justice and strong institutions in SDG 16. Therefore, the corresponding investment in those SDGs should be made to ameliorate the impact of COVID-19. It is interesting that progress towards the SDGs in the region of East Asia and the Pacific was least affected because the countries in the region effectively responded to the pandemic outbreak, as illustrated in a previous study34,35,37. Their success depended significantly on excellent hygiene practices among the public and receiving intensive public health care, from which other countries can learn35.\n\nThese results also highlight the discrepancies between nations with different incomes. The greater impacts in poorer countries is resulted by the lack of financing and other measures to curb the pandemic35. The COVID-19 crisis has further put pressure on donor aid budgets (SDG 17), reinforcing the need to increase fiscal space in the poorest countries through more instruments (including taxes, ODA, other additional resources, and debt relief) to achieve SDG34,42. The observed high impacts on SDG 3 across all different income categories were broadly consistent with the findings that all nations are required to “strengthen their capacity for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks”. Even for the high-income countries, similar actions are also necessary despite that they were considered to be best prepared to face pandemics35. In poor countries, the pandemic severely hampers SDG 7 because disruptions in the supply chain can wreak havoc on energy services (e.g., SDG 7.1 electricity and SDG 7.2 clean energy), and reduced incomes can limit people’s ability to pay for energy services42. Yet access to energy is a prerequisite for economic prosperity health and education, and an important multiplier for all SDGs. Without these fundamentals, the most vulnerable are at risk of being trapped in a cycle of poverty and inequality, so the primary goal is to increase access to energy for those who fall last43. SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) in poorer counties has stagnating even before COVID-19.In richer countries, its progress was improved before but has since been delayed and undermined by COVID-19. as a result of extraordinary measures introduced by some governments to increase their power, leaving citizens with relatively high levels of perceived corruption (SDG16.6), low freedom of expression (SDG 16.9), or high levels of insecurity (SDG 16.3)35.\n\nWe have demonstrated the risks of national progress towards the SDGs after COVID-19 on the basis of income groups. In HICs and UMICs, there are relatively more risks of failing to achieve SDG 10 by 2030, but the risks are related to ongoing development gaps in reducing inequality before the pandemic. It is associated to some extent with the phenomenon of “poor government but rich private sector”, which reduces the capacity of government to redistribute wealth to reduce inequality, especially for disadvantaged groups40. This is more evident in UMICs, which have even less wealth and subsequent capacity to address the issue. Government capacity could be enhanced by increasing revenue or restructuring spending so that policies such as expanding social safety nets to reduce inequality could be developed44. However, this could be politically challenging.\n\nAdditionally, UMICs have faced “major challenges” in progressing towards SDGs 9, 15, 16, and 17. Among them, SDGs 9 and 16 experienced setbacks due to COVID-19 impacts, while SDGs 15 and 17 were hampered by pre-COVID-19 development gaps. Therefore, UMICs need more targeted options to address both existing concerns and the effects of COVID-19 in association with different SDGs. For example, any unsustainable supply chain could be limited to reduce the loss of terrestrial biodiversity and deforestation in SDG 1535, and partnerships among government and private sectors in SDG 17 could be strengthened to broadly address the development of the SDGs38. For impacts of COVID-19, especially in regard to the increased authoritarianism in response to COVID-19, governance to strengthen rather than reduce freedom of expression and enhance the transparency of governmental responses to the pandemic are important in continuing to advance SDG 16. In addition, inequalities in UMICs can be affected primarily by unequal economic growth45, which became even more notable during the pandemic as a result of substantial income loss in disadvantaged groups. Moreover, disparity in the possibility of education leads to disadvantaged groups having fewer options, not only to find income sources45 but also to endure the impacts and, more importantly, recover from the impacts of the pandemic. Therefore, policies designed to reduce inequality in social security in terms of both income and education can be very important to moderate COVID-19 impacts on UMICs.\n\nIn poorer countries, the recovery of progress towards the SDGs after COVID-19 continues to be hampered by problems that occurred widely across SDGs even before the pandemic, as shown in our results. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) pointed out that poorer countries account for only approximately 15% of global investment, even though they make up half of the world’s population46. This is demonstrated by a lack of public expenditures and market access to capital34,35,38, which makes the recovery of progress towards the SDGs after the COVID-19 impacts even more challenging in LMICs and LICs. Therefore, a strong call to act by providing broader aid to LICs and LMICs is needed to address these fundamental issues. The call to improve industry innovation and infrastructure is even more compelling, as our results reveal that SDG 9 has been considerably impacted in addition to the development gap that existed before the pandemic. The UN pointed out that small-scale industries that are common in developing countries were severely affected by the pandemic owing to a lack of capital and investment. The situation is even more dire in the poorest countries42. In addition to relevant policies, taking advantage of the latest technological developments to advance industry innovation can be effective, such as universal digital services that can offer wide-open markets and affordable e-services, e.g., e-education, telemedicine and e-financing44.\n\nIn LICs, our results show that progress towards SDG 7 is at high risk after COVID-19. In fact, the UN noted that COVID-19 could impede progress towards SDG 7 in LICs, although great progress towards accessing clean fuels and technologies was made prior to the outbreak47. This was again caused by increasing expenditures in response to COVID-19, using funds that could otherwise have been invested in SDG 7. Progress towards SDGs 1 and 3 was also largely impacted by COVID-19 in LICs, as shown by income losses from reduced tourism, remittances, and exports of goods35. Additionally, the longtime poor public health systems further exacerbated COVID-19 impacts. Efforts to eradicate poverty and improve health and well-being must be further pursued.\n\nAlthough this study provides important and interesting findings, it has to be pointed out that there are some limitations in data and methodology. First, the identified COVID-19 impacts on progress towards SDGs were based on the data from 91 indicators, rather than all 231 United Nations’ indicators, primarily because most of the other indicators are either hard to quantify or lack data34. As more data become available in the future, our approach can be applied to the updated SDG indicators database to provide a more comprehensive and detailed picture. Second, countries may use the lessons learned from COVID-19 to make rapid progress toward achieving the SDGs, such as increasing global cooperation, promoting technology development, accelerating digitization, and raising health awareness48. Future research can further investigate the other paths with rapid recovery based on lessons from COVID-19.\n\nIn conclusion, the overall impact of COVID-19 on the progress towards the SDGs has multiple facets. It is not only affected by the interwoven relationships among SDGs that magnify the impact, but also depending on the status of each country in terms of its latest SDG progress performance and resilience in recovering from COVID-19. We thus propose a relatively simple and reasonable approach to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 on progress towards the SDGs by 2030 at the global, regional and national scales. It will help to prioritize actions and take more effective approaches to recover and rebuild progress towards the SDGs in the post-COVID-19 period.\n\nThe logic of this study is illustrated in Fig. 7. We develop a process-based scenario to systematically assess COVID-19 impacts at global, regional and national scales. COVID-19 impacts were simulated based on the approach, as shown in Fig. 1, covering the entire process of the SDGs in response to the COVID-19 shocks. The approach includes the shock loss related to the immediate response of SDG progress to the COVID shocks and growth delay loss in association with the deceleration and recovery of SDG progress following the immediate response. Importantly, it depends on countries, affected not only by their capacity to prevent or reduce shock loss but also by their ability to recover, as emphasized by the United Nations43.\n\nThe first step was to evaluate the global COVID-19 impacts represented by the shock loss and growth delay loss of SDG progress in each country following three COVID-19 shocks (i.e., increased mortality and morbidity associated with the pandemic outbreak, economies and activities slowed by lockdowns and depleted public resources). The second step was to measure the COVID-19 impacts on regional and national progress towards the SDGs by 2030 in the post-COVID period. The third step was to categorize the risks of countries in different income groups failing to achieve the SDGs by 2030.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts on global progress towards the SDGs by 2030\n\nCOVID-19 impacts on progress \\(({{{{{{\\boldsymbol{T}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{c}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}})\\) for each goal (\\({{{{{\\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}\\)) in each country (\\({{{{{\\boldsymbol{c}}}}}}\\)) include shock loss \\(({{{{{{\\boldsymbol{S}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{c}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}})\\) and growth delay loss \\(({{{{{{\\boldsymbol{G}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{c}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}})\\,\\), the calculation formula is as follows:\n\n$${T}_{c,g}={S}_{c,g}+{G}_{c,g}$$\n\n(1)\n\nThe shock loss, or the loss with respect to setbacks in progress towards the SDGs induced by COVID-19 shocks, was estimated in three steps. First, the nominal direct impacts of COVID-19 were mapped on the 92 SDG indicators through ten paths of impacts pertinent to the three COVID-19 shocks based on comprehensive analysis of the literature (see Supplementary Note 1). Second, the nominal indirect impacts between indicators of the SDG targets were calculated. Third, the nominal direct and indirect impacts were then adjusted by COVID-19 severity and the degree of each country’s progress towards the SDGs before the pandemic to finally attain the shock loss of SDG progress in each country. Fourth, the growth delay loss was simulated by assuming that progress towards each SDG initially decelerated after the shock loss and then recovered, leading to a delay in progress towards the SDGs. The COVID-19 impacts on the SDGs in each country were combined effects of shock loss and growth delay loss. COVID-19 impacts on SDG progress in 163 countries were eventually evaluated (see Supplementary Table 2 for the specific countries). The impacts on global progress towards the SDGs were estimated by the population-weighted aggregation of the COVID-19 impacts on all countries.\n\nFirst, the nominal direct impacts of COVID-19 on SDGs were estimated. We obtained the performance of progress towards all SDGs in each country from the Sustainable Development Report (SDR), which has been jointly issued by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Bertelsmann Foundation every year since 201634,49. SDR 2021 was chosen as our dataset because it has the most countries and indicators. A total of 92 indicators in 193 countries were selected from the report, with the same set of indicators being utilized for all countries to have comparable scores (see indicators in the Supplementary Data 1 for details). International organizations provide the majority of the data utilized in this report, such as the World Bank, the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund and others, which have comprehensive and stringent data-validation processes34.\n\nOn the basis of SDR 202035 and SDR 202134, together with the relevant literature (see details in Supplementary Note 1), the nominal direct impact of COVID-19 on each SDG indicator can be affected through ten paths aligned with three initial COVID-19 shocks. The degrees of nominal direct impacts are then divided into six levels (see the scoring criteria in Supplementary Table 1). The detailed justification in association with the specific impact paths of COVID-19 on the specific SDG indicators can be found in Supplementary Note 1. The impact pathway and score for each of the 92 SDG indicators are shown in Supplementary Data 1. To better demonstrate, the direct consequences of COVID-19 shocks acting on specific SDG indicators through impact pathways are shown graphically in Fig. 2. In the specific calculation process, the calculation formula is as follows:\n\n$$A=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\begin{array}{c}\\begin{array}{c}{a}_{1}\\\\ {a}_{2}\\end{array}\\\\ {a}_{3}\\\\ \\vdots \\end{array}\\\\ {a}_{i}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {a}_{92}\\end{array}\\right]{D}_{G}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\begin{array}{c}\\begin{array}{c}{D}_{1}\\\\ {D}_{2}\\end{array}\\\\ {D}_{3}\\\\ \\vdots \\end{array}\\\\ {D}_{{{{{{\\rm{g}}}}}}}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {D}_{17}\\end{array}\\right]$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere A is the nominal direct impact matrix of COVID-19 on 92 indicators through specific impact paths, and ai is the nominal direct impact score of COVID-19 on the ith indicator. DG is the nominal direct impact value of COVID-19 on 17 SDGs, Dg represents the nominal direct impact value of COVID-19 on a certain SDG. \\({D}_{{{{{{\\rm{g}}}}}}}=\\frac{{\\sum }_{j=1}^{{n}_{g}}{a}_{gj}}{{n}_{g}}\\) (g = 1, 2, 3……17), ng represents the number of indicators under the gth SDG, and agj is the nominal direct impact value of COVID-19 on the jth indicator under the gth SDG.\n\nBy referring to the “short-term impacts of COVID-19” in SDR 2020, on which the scoring is based, as described above, we also categorized the results of the nominal direct impacts of COVID-19 shocks on 17 SDGs into three levels for visualization, i.e., highly negative impact, mixed or moderately negative impact, and impact still unclear (see Fig. 2).\n\nSecond, the nominal indirect impacts of COVID-19 on SDGs were estimated. Following Pradhan12, Kroll13 et al., we used Spearman correlation coefficients to represent the interconnections between two indicators of the SDGs. We analyzed the interconnections between SDG indicators to assess the cascading effects of COVID-19 on the SDGs. We applied the data in association with the same 92 indicators of 17 SDGs previously analyzed from 2010 to 2019 for all 193 UN member states (excluding data for 2020 and 2021, which may have been affected by COVID-19; as of October 1, 2021; raw data are available at www.sdgindex.org). We finally examined the interconnections of a total of 3933 indicator pairs for 10 consecutive years, as 253 were missing among 4186 pairs of indicators due to unavailable data. To avoid false correlation if the indicator definition was in opposition to the intended trajectory, the time series were multiplied by −1 and, if they were concurrent, by 1 (see detailed signs in Supplementary Data 1). The correlation between indicators was considered statistically significant with a p value of less than 0.05. In the calculation process, the calculation formula is as follows:\n\n$$B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}{b}_{1,1} & {b}_{1,2} & \\cdots & {b}_{1,92}\\\\ {b}_{2,1} & {b}_{2,2} & \\cdots & {b}_{2,92}\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & {b}_{i,i{{\\hbox{'}}}} & \\vdots \\\\ {b}_{92,1} & {b}_{92,2} & \\cdots & {b}_{92,92}\\end{array}\\right]$$\n\n(3)\n\n$${I}_{G}=\\, AB=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{a}_{1}{b}_{1,1}+{a}_{2}{b}_{1,2}+\\cdots +{a}_{92}{b}_{1,92}\\\\ {a}_{1}{b}_{2,1}+{a}_{2}{b}_{2,2}+\\cdots +{a}_{92}{b}_{2,92}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\begin{array}{c}{a}_{i}{b}_{i,i{{\\hbox{'}}}}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {a}_{1}{b}_{92,1}+{a}_{2}{b}_{92,2}+\\cdots +{a}_{92}{b}_{92,92}\\end{array}\\end{array}\\right]\\\\ =\\, \\left[\\begin{array}{c}{I}_{1,1}+{I}_{1,2}+\\cdots +{I}_{1,17}\\\\ {I}_{2,1}+{I}_{2,2}+\\cdots +{I}_{2,17}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\begin{array}{c}{I}_{g,g{{\\hbox{'}}}}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {I}_{17,1}+{I}_{17,2}+\\cdots +{I}_{17,17}\\end{array}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\begin{array}{c}{I}_{1}\\\\ {I}_{2}\\\\ \\vdots \\end{array}\\\\ {I}_{{{{{{\\rm{g}}}}}}}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {I}_{17}\\end{array}\\right]$$\n\n(4)\n\nWhere, matrix B is the correlation matrix among indicators pairs with impact relation, and bi,i′ is the impact coefficient of i’th indicator on the ith indicator. IG is the nominal indirect impact value of COVID-19 on 17 SDGs. aibi,i′ is the nominal indirect impact value of i’th indicator on the ith indicator. Ig,g′ represents the nominal indirect impact value of the g’th goal on the gth goal, the nominal indirect impact values among the 17 SDGs induced by the cascading effects of COVID-19 through their interconnections are represented graphically as Fig. 3, \\({I}_{g,g^{\\prime} }=\\frac{{\\sum }_{j=1}^{{n}_{g}}{\\sum }_{j^{\\prime} =1}^{{n}_{g^{\\prime} }}{a}_{gj}{b}_{gj,g^{\\prime} j^{\\prime} }}{{n}_{g}}\\) (g and g’ = 1, 2, 3……17), ng represents the number of indicators under the gth goal, \\({n}_{{g{{\\hbox{'}}}}}\\) represents the number of indicators under the g’th goal, bgj,g′j′ is the impact coefficient of j’th indicator under the g’th on the jth indicator under the gth SDG, agjbgj,g′j′ is the nominal indirect impact value of COVID-19 of j’th indicator under the g’th on the jth indicator under the gth SDG. Ig is the nominal indirect impact value of COVID-19 on the gth goal.\n\nThird, the shock loss of SDG progress in countries were estimated. We obtained the shock loss \\(({{{{{{\\boldsymbol{S}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{c}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}})\\) for each goal (\\({{{{{\\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}\\)) in each country (\\({{{{{\\boldsymbol{c}}}}}}\\)) by combining the direct shock loss \\(({{{{{{\\boldsymbol{D}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{c}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}})\\) and indirect shock loss \\(({{{{{{\\boldsymbol{I}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{c}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}})\\) as follows:\n\n$${S}_{c,g}={D}_{c,g}+{I}_{c,g}$$\n\n(5)\n\n$${D}_{c,g}=\\frac{{D}_{g}\\times {S}_{c}\\times {X}_{c,t}}{1000}$$\n\n(6)\n\n$${I}_{c,g}=\\frac{{I}_{g}\\times {S}_{c}\\times {X}_{c,t}}{1000}$$\n\n(7)\n\nWhere Dg is the nominal direct impact on each SDG (g = 1, 2, 3……17) and Ig is the indirect nominal impact on each goal (g = 1, 2, 3……17). Sc, the GCI Severity Index, is the extent to which the c-th country is affectd by the COVID-19 shocks. Xc,t represents the SDG index of each country in the most recent year before the pandemic (i.e., 2019), describing the overall progress performance of 17 SDGs from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). One-thousandth is the adjustment factor, as we assume that the impact on the SDGs was within the range of the world GDP growth rate of −3.1% in 2020 in the World Economic Look by the IMF50.\n\nThe GCI Severity Index among the Global COVID-19 Index (GCI) was developed by Malaysia’s Performance Management & Delivery Unit (PEMANDU Associates) in collaboration with the Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MOSTI) and recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO)31. We applied the latest adjusted SDG indicator data included in SDR 2021 for retrospective calculations to calculate the SDG progress of each country in 2019. In more detail, we calculated the SDG index in three steps. (1) Establish performance thresholds (upper and lower bounds) for each indicator. Any greater than or equal to the upper limit of the indicators has a score of 100 (i.e., best performance), while any less than or equal to the lower limit of the indicators has a score of zero (i.e., worst performance). (2) Normalize the data to the range of [0; 100] to facilitate the interpretation and comparison of all indicators. (3) Aggregate indicators of the same SDG by using the arithmetic mean in an equal weight, as described by the SDR (available at www.sdgindex.org). A similar approach was used by Schmidt-Traub51, Xu52 et al. to assess the process of sustainable development.\n\nFourth, the growth delay loss of SDG progress in countries were estimated. Consistent with the SDR34,35,38,39, we represent the progress rate towards goal “g” before COVID-19 by its average annual rate, Ratepre,c,g. Based on the development trend of the SDGs, typically in the most recent period of 2015–2019:\n\n$$R{{{{{{\\rm{ate}}}}}}}_{pre,c,g}=\\frac{{X}_{c,g}({t}_{1})-{X}_{c,g}({t}_{0})}{{t}_{1}-{t}_{0}}$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Xc,g(t) is the SDG index in year t for goal “g” in country “c”, t0 is typically in 2015, and t1 is the end of the record period. The progress rates of the SDGs after the shock loss, Ratepost,c,g(t), were assumed to slow down during the shock and then recover, as described by:\n\n$$R{{{{{{\\rm{ate}}}}}}}_{post,c,g}(t)=\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha {e}^{-\\frac{t-2020}{{\\tau }_{re{{{{\\mathrm{cov}}}}}er}}}}R{{{{{{\\rm{ate}}}}}}}_{pre,c,g}$$\n\n(9)\n\nWhere α represents the ratio of SDG growth rate deduction by the COVID-19 impacts, equaling the GCI Severity Index as a percentage. τrecover is a time factor that reflects the speed of recovery of SDG growth, calculated using 1-the GCI Recovery Index (as a percentage). The GCI Severity and Recovery Index were both derived from the Global COVID-19 Index (GCI). It is expected to take 2–3 years for most countries to return to prepandemic levels. This estimate is consistent with the timing of the recovery in economic growth projected in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals Report 202142. Thus, the expected progress towards the SDGs by 2030 is (see more details in Supplementary Fig. 1):\n\n$${X}_{post,c,g}(2030)={X}_{c,g}({t}_{1})-{S}_{c,g}+R{{{{{{\\rm{ate}}}}}}}_{pre,c,g}{\\int }_{t{{\\hbox{'}}}}^{2030}\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha {e}^{-\\frac{\\tau -2020}{{\\tau }_{re{{{{\\mathrm{cov}}}}}er}}}}d\\tau$$\n\n(10)\n\nWhere t′ is the year to start recovery and 2020 was chosen because the world economy has been recovering since mid-2020 and is driven by large fiscal policies, as explained by the IMF50. The model takes into account the national capacities that are critical to developing resistance to COVID-19 shocks and speedy recovery after shocks based on national progress towards the SDGs by 2030. The capacity related to resistance is reflected by factors including confirmed cases per population relevant to COVID-19 and the Global Health Security Index31. Additionally, the capacity pertinent to recovery is described by factors including active cases, governance, and WHO universal health coverage31. Therefore, the growth delay loss by 2030 for goal g of country c was estimated by Gc,g:\n\n$${G}_{c,g}={X}_{{{{{{\\rm{pre}}}}}},c,g}(2030)-{X}_{{{{{{\\rm{post}}}}}},c,g}(2030)-{S}_{c,g}$$\n\n(11)\n\nWhere Xpre,c,g(2030) is the SDG progress expected to be achieved by 2030 prior to COVID-19 (see more details in Supplementary Fig. 1) and is given by:\n\n$${X}_{pre,c,g}(2030)={X}_{c,g}({t}_{1})+(2030-{t}_{1})Rat{e}_{{{{{{\\rm{pre}}}}}},c,g}$$\n\n(12)\n\nCOVID-19 impacts on regional and national progress towards the SDGs by 2030\n\nTo highlight changes in SDG progress as a result of COVID-19 impacts, we applied the change ratio T’c,g to map the total impacts of COVID-19 on regional progress by 2030 (see Fig. 5):\n\n$$T{{{\\hbox{'}}}}_{c,g}(2030)=\\frac{{T}_{c,g}}{{X}_{{{{{{\\rm{pre}}}}}},c,g}}$$\n\n(13)\n\n$$T{{{\\hbox{'}}}}_{c,g,D}(2030)=\\frac{{D}_{c,g}}{{X}_{{{{{{\\rm{pre}}}}}},c,g}}$$\n\n(14)\n\n$$T{{{\\hbox{'}}}}_{c,g,I}(2030)=\\frac{{I}_{c,g}}{{X}_{{{{{{\\rm{pre}}}}}},c,g}}$$\n\n(15)\n\nWhere \\(T{{\\,\\!}^{\\prime} }_{c,g,D}(2030)\\) and \\(T{{\\,\\!}^{\\prime} }_{c,g,I}(2030)\\) is the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on regional progress by 2030 for goal “g” in country “c”, respectively. \\(T{{\\,\\!}^{\\prime} }_{c,g}(2030)\\) was divided into five levels by using K-mean clustering (more details in Supplementary Table 3). For comparison with the total impact \\(T{{\\,\\!}^{\\prime} }_{c,g}(2030)\\), the classification of \\(T{{\\,\\!}^{\\prime} }_{c,g,D}(2030)\\) and \\(T{{\\,\\!}^{\\prime} }_{c,g,I}(2030)\\) are consistent with the above five levels. The impacts of COVID-19 on progress in a region were based on the population-weighted average (Fig. 5). Furthermore, we used the same methodology as described above for regions to analyze the COVID-19 impacts on national progress towards the SDGs by 2030 in different income groups.\n\nPost-COVID-19 risks of failing to achieve the SDGs by 2030\n\nFinally, we assume that the risks of failing to achieve the SDGs by 2030 in each country in the post-COVID-19 period were decided by both the expected progress gap in meeting the SDGs by 2030 prior to COVID-19 and the indicative progress loss subsequent to COVID-19. We standardized the COVID-19 impacts on SDG progress in each country and then applied K-mean clustering to categorize the standard scores into high/medium/low levels for a clear comparison (see more details in Fig. 6). We also estimated the progress gap in meeting the SDGs by 2030 prior to COVID-19 with zero, implying that a country was almost certain to achieve a relevant goal. The expected gap ranges from 0 to 100, representing no gap to a full gap (no progress) in meeting each SDG by 2030. The progress gap in an income group was based on the population-weighted average and was also grouped into three levels: high, medium and low. The greater expected progress gap prior to COVID-19 and indicative progress loss subsequent to COVID-19 implies a higher risk of failing to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Combining the standard scores of SDG progress loss and progress gap, the post-COVID-19 risks to SDG progress were grouped into three levels: high, medium and low. The post-COVID-19 risks of national progress towards the SDGs are then summarized into four income groups defined by the World Bank to consider economic development: LICs, LMICs, UMICs, and HICs32, where both the standard score and expected gap to represent an entire income group are weighted by the populations of the countries in the group.""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-excess-deaths-zero-covid-study-rcna101746', 'Headline': 'China had almost 2 million excess deaths after the end of ‘zero-Covid ...', 'Snippet': 'China’s strict zero-Covid policies, which included mass testing, border closures and extended citywide lockdowns, kept Covid cases and deaths to a minimum for much of the pandemic.But when the ...', 'Full_text': 'HONG KONG — There were almost 2 million excess deaths in the two months after China lifted its “zero-Covid” restrictions, a U.S. study found, contradicting official figures from Beijing that have been criticized as too low.\n\nResearchers estimate there were 1.87 million excess deaths from all causes among people 30 years and older from December 2022 to January, according to the study from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle published Thursday. The deaths, which were observed across all mainland Chinese provinces, except Tibet, were predominantly among older people.\n\nChina’s strict zero-Covid policies, which included mass testing, border closures and extended citywide lockdowns, kept Covid cases and deaths to a minimum for much of the pandemic. But when the government abruptly lifted the restrictions in December after rare mass protests across the country, the virus was unleashed on 1.4 billion people who had barely been exposed to it.\n\nThe resulting wave of cases, driven by the highly transmissible omicron variant, brought a huge increase in hospitalizations and deaths that experts say were underreported by officials. They pointed to anecdotal evidence, as well as satellite imagery showing heightened activity at crematoriums and funeral homes.\n\nThe 1.87 million figure is far higher than the official data from China, which said about 60,000 Covid–related deaths had been recorded in health facilities from early December 2022 to Jan. 12.\n\nIt is also consistent with estimates by other researchers, including a study by Zhanwei Du of the University of Hong Kong and Lauren Ancel Meyers of the University of Texas at Austin that found Covid may have killed more than 1.4 million people in China from Dec. 16, 2022 to Jan. 19.\n\nThe estimate from the study released Thursday was based on obituaries published by three Chinese universities for both current and retired employees, as well as searches on Baidu, a popular Chinese internet search engine, for words such as “cremation” and “burial.”\n\n“Our study of excess deaths related to the lifting of the zero-Covid policy in China sets an empirically derived benchmark estimate,” the researchers wrote. “These findings are important for understanding how the sudden propagation of Covid-19 across a population may impact population mortality.”\n\nThe study did appear to be “close to the actual data” based on the research available so far, said Jin Dong-yan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. The way the study estimates data is not “scientifically rigorous,” but it is nonetheless an “objective” and “beneficial” attempt, Jin added.\n\nJin said the actual data could be a few percentage points lower or higher than the study estimates. The university employees used as benchmarks by the study, most of whom are intellectuals living in cities, may be characterized by a stronger self-preparatory awareness, higher vaccination rate, and more accessible health care resources, Jin said. This could be offset since they may also have been more likely to have underlying health conditions than normal people, Jin added.\n\n“The best approach would be for the country to be honest and transparent, disclosing everything just as it was done in previous years such as 2018 and 2019,” Jin said.\n\nOverall, China has reported fewer than 122,000 Covid-related deaths to the World Health Organization. The United States, by comparison, has reported more than 1.1 million Covid-related deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nChinese officials deny they have withheld Covid data from the international community, accusing the U.S., WHO and others of politicizing the pandemic. They say they are still analyzing excess deaths and will have a more complete picture of the Covid death toll at a later date.\n\nCalls to China’s National Health Commission went unanswered Friday.'}}",96.875,2

Here are the key highlights for income distribution by age:\n\nIn terms of income distribution across age cohorts, in Illinois, householders within the 45 to 64 years age group have the highest median household income at $92,666, followed by those in the 25 to 44 years age group with an income of $86,623. Meanwhile householders within the 65 years and over age group report the second lowest median household income of $55,071. Notably, householders within the under 25 years age group, had the lowest median household income at $39,545.\n\nNotably, household income for individuals within the Under 25 years age group demonstrated a remarkable increase of $11,031(38.69%), escalating from a median of $28,514 in 2012 to $39,545 in 2022.\n\n202,133(4%) households where the householder is under 25 years old.\n\n1,674,567(33.12%) households with a householder aged between 25 and 44 years.\n\n1,816,796(35.93%) households with a householder aged between 45 and 64 years.\n\n1,362,864(26.95%) households where the householder is over 65 years old.\n\nRead more about Illinois median household income by age ➔\n\nGender\n\nIn Illinois, the population consists of 6.33 million males (49.39%) and 6.49 million females (50.61%). Here are the primary highlights from the gender-based income distribution analysis:\n\nIn Illinois, the median income for all workers aged 15 years and older, regardless of work hours, was $48,807 for males and $32,877 for females.\n\nHowever, when specifically considering full-time, year-round workers within the same age group, the median income was $67,800 for males and $54,544 for females.\n\nIn Illinois, the median income for all workers aged 15 years and older, regardless of work hours, was $48,807 for males and $32,877 for females.\n\nIn Illinois, among full-time, year-round workers aged 15 years and older, males earned a median income of $67,800, while females earned $54,544, leading to a 20% gender pay gap among full-time workers. This illustrates that women earn 80 cents for each dollar earned by men in full-time roles. This analysis indicates a widening gender pay gap, showing a substantial income disparity where women, despite working full-time, face a more significant wage discrepancy compared to men in the same roles.\n\nRead more about Illinois income by gender ➔\n\nRace\n\nIn Illinois, the population is predominantly White, constituting 67.85% of the total residents. Here are the key highlights from the analysis of income distribution by race:\n\nThe median household income for White households is $83,346.\n\nIn Illinois, despite the White population being the most populous, it is worth noting that Asian households actually reports the highest median household income, with a median income of $104,287. This reveals that, while Whites may be the most numerous in Illinois, Asian households experience greater economic prosperity in terms of median household income.\n\nIn Illinois, the median household income for the households where the householder is White increased by $6,059(7.84%), between 2012 and 2022. The median household income, in 2022 inflation-adjusted dollars, was $77,287 in 2012 and $83,346 in 2022.\n\nIn Illinois, the median household income for the households where the householder is Black or African American increased by $3,918(9.53%), between 2012 and 2022. The median household income, in 2022 inflation-adjusted dollars, was $41,101 in 2012 and $45,019 in 2022.\n\nRead more about Illinois median household income by race ➔\n\nYear by year\n\nIllinois median household income trends by year, family type and household size (2010-2021):\n\nFrom 2010 to 2021, the median household income for Illinois increased by $3,232 (4.30%), as per the American Community Survey estimates.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2021, median household income, adjusted for 2022 inflation, experienced growth year by year for 7 years and declined for 4 years.\n\nThe most significant year-by-year growth occured from 2019 to 2020, when the median household income increased by 1,888 (from $75,651 to $77,539). Similarly the most substantial year-by-year decline occured from 2010 to 2011, when the median household income decreased by 1,225 (from $75,202 to $73,977).\n\nIt then further increased to $115,980 for 7-person households, the largest household size for which the bureau reported a median household income.\n\nWith a Gini coefficient of 0.4837, it is evident that income distribution in Illinois exihibits characterstics of moderate inequality .\n\nFor the family households, the median income (in 2022 inflation-adjusted dollars) was $96,948. For the non-family households, the median income (in 2022 inflation-adjusted dollars) was $46,533.\n\nRead more about Illinois median household income ➔\n\nReferences\n\nU.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) 2017-2021 5-Year Estimates\n\nConsumer Price Index retroactive series using current methods (R-CPI-U-RS)\n\nExplore related topics\n\nIllinois Demographics\n\nExplore more\n\nMedian household income of nearby states (in 2022 dollars)\n\nIllinois income$78,434 Wisconsin income$72,508 Michigan income$68,316 Indiana income$66,956 Ohio income$66,950\n\nView all states in United States ➔\n\nUnited States income insights ➔\n\nMedian household income of popular cities (in 2022 dollars)\n\nNaperville income$146,758 Elgin income$86,210 Aurora income$86,086 Joliet income$83,633 Chicago income$71,103 Waukegan income$63,605 Springfield income$62,256 Peoria income$57,902 Champaign income$56,950 Rockford income$50,805\n\nMedian household income of popular counties (in 2022 dollars)\n\nDuPage County income$108,407 Lake County income$104,986 Will County income$103,498 McHenry County income$101,391 Kane County income$96,131 Cook County income$77,956 Madison County income$72,294 St. Clair County income$68,116 Winnebago County income$62,454 Champaign County income$61,546\n\nAbout the author\n\nNeilsberg Research\n\nNeilsberg Research team are data scientists with expertise in processing, analysis and visualization of big data helping small businesses make right decisions.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be legal or tax advice.

Census data are particularly helpful, as they allow us to track and measure progress in the key areas of economic security, education, and health. The annual American Community Survey estimates provide detailed demographic data that help us understand how Illinois children and families are doing and where we can improve outcomes. This week, new data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population and American Community Surveys (ACS) reveal the benefits of federal and state relief and investments for children and families in 2021.This post provides a general overview of the state-level 2021 ACS data release, reviewing information about household income, poverty, and health coverage. This data release provides updated information to YWCA’s 2022 Illinois KIDS COUNT policy brief, which provides more comprehensive information on the state of child well-being in Illinois and policy solutions for an equitable recovery.Data Release HighlightsACS state-level data illustrate how Illinoisans fared in 2021. On average, Illinois children and families experienced better outcomes than the national averages in median income, poverty, and health insurance coverage. Based on the data released today, these key areas were greatly impacted by federal and state COVID relief last year. From 2019 to 2021, our state’s median income only decreased, our poverty rates increased by less than 1%, and our uninsured rates decreased by thousands.Median Household IncomeMedian household income data give insight into the amount and distribution of income among households in a specific geography. In Illinois, the median household income was $72,205. In 2019 before the pandemic, the median household income was $69,187. When we take inflation into account, the median income has decreased by over $1,000 from 2021 to 2019. This indicates a reduction in household incomes across our state, but some households have experienced more decreases than others. Households headed by women and households of color earn less over their lifetime. These disparities are due to systemic racism that results in inequities in accessing education and employment for women and people of color. The wage gap for women working full time, year-round has continued with men ($65,834) earning $13,711 more than women ($52,123). For households of color, the wage gap was even larger. Black households earned the least of all households, $42,118, which was $30,000 less than the Illinois median household income. These disparities make it clear that centering gender and racial equity in policies that boost household income can help alleviate inequities.PovertyThe poverty rate is determined by a household’s income. If a family or individual’s income is below the Federal poverty threshold, they are considered poor. For 2021, the official poverty threshold was $27,479 for a family of four. ACS data show that, relative to 2019, Illinois households experienced a 0.6% percent increase in poverty with almost 1.5 million (12.1%) of residents living in poverty. Disparities in racial/ethnic identity become apparent when we disaggregate the data. People of color experience higher poverty rates in Illinois. And Black Illinoisans face a poverty rate two times higher than residents of other racial/ethnic identities. Compared to 2019, Illinois children experienced a 0.3% percent increase in poverty, with over 442,000 (16%) children living in poverty in 2021. When we disaggregate the data by racial/ethnic identity, it becomes clear that children of color are experiencing higher rates of poverty. Both Black and Latinx children in Illinois were more likely to experience poverty compared to other children. Growing up in poverty can have developmental consequences for children. Moreover, children can experience worse economic, health, and educational outcomes in the future. To address these challenges, anti-poverty solutions that increase financial security are critical to meeting basic needs and improving resources for children across the state.Health Coverage During a global pandemic, 875,000 (7.0%) Illinoisans were uninsured in 2021. This was 48,000 fewer Illinoisans uninsured than before the pandemic. The Illinois’ uninsured rate was lower than the national uninsured rate (8.6%). From 2013 to 2016, Illinois’ uninsured rates improved, but rates started reversing from 2017 to 2019. These increases in the number and percentage of uninsured among all Illinoisans and children was a concerning trend. Fortunately, these 2021 data demonstrate the pandemic-era health policies protected more Illinois residents from health emergencies and excessive health care costs. In terms of types of insurance, rates of Illinoisans with Employer-based and Medicare coverage stayed similar, while direct-purchase insurance (e.g., Affordable Care Act) and public insurance (e.g., Medicaid) increased from 2019 to 2021. Given the importance of health insurance coverage for both physical and mental health, Illinois must expand coverage to more adults--especially undocumented adults--and outreach to families regarding All Kids enrollment. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of federal and state actions that protected many Illinois families from severe hardships. Unfortunately, any improvements in income, poverty, and health coverage will disappear in the coming years absent long-term state and federal investments in anti-poverty tools like the child tax credit; food and rental assistance; and more accessible health coverage.

Nearly 240,000 of them are considered to live in “deep poverty,” which is incomes of less than one-half of the poverty line.\n\nThe Chicago households most commonly in deep poverty are single-mother families, with nearly 101,000 individuals.\n\nOf the city’s mom-led households, 17.7% lived in deep poverty. Married couple families faced deep poverty rates of only 2.6%. Families in “other” living arrangements – such as single fathers and their children or households where children are being raised by someone other than their parents – also face substantially lower deep poverty rates at 12.2%.\n\nTo be considered in “deep poverty,” a household of two had to earn less than $12.54 per person per day. For single mothers with multiple children, the figure was even less.\n\nExtremely high levels of poverty among single mothers is part of the reason why women in Chicago are 21% more likely to be impoverished than men. Poverty is also more common among women in Chicago than in other large cities throughout the country.\n\nThese differences are likely attributable to discrepancies in labor force participation between men and women, which differ even more dramatically among mothers and fathers. Lower labor force participation among mothers is concerning, as data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows employment status is the single-most important factor impacting the poverty rate. Full-time employees in Chicago not only face lower poverty rates than Americans in other large cities, but securing full-time, year-round employment virtually eliminates the odds of being in poverty.\n\nFortunately, research has shown that public policy can positively influence employment, particularly among single mothers, while evidence also suggests anti-poverty programs that incentivize work have been effective in increasing employment and raising incomes to promote upward mobility.\n\nFuture poverty alleviation solutions should focus on ways to encourage labor force participation and secure better employment outcomes for capable individuals. Reducing barriers to entry into the labor force, removing cumbersome regulations, improving the quality of education and fostering an environment in which employees, employers and communities can flourish all present opportunities for public policy solutions that can reduce poverty and improve the lives of Chicagoans – regardless of their income status.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://usafacts.org/topics/economy/state/illinois/', 'Headline': 'Economy of Illinois Statistics and Data Trends: GDP ranking ...', 'Snippet': 'The latest data shows that Illinois has a higher unemployment rate than the US overall.

(Only parents with children under age 18 were included in this study.)\n\nAmong parents with middle and upper incomes, mental health concerns top the list of parental worries, followed by concerns about bullying. About four-in-ten middle-income parents (38%) and 32% of those with upper incomes say they are extremely or very worried that their children might struggle with anxiety or depression at some point. A third of middle-income parents and about a quarter (24%) of those with upper incomes are similarly concerned about their children being bullied, while considerably smaller shares say they are extremely or very concerned about the other items on this list.\n\nAmong lower-income parents, mental health and bullying are also top concerns, with roughly half saying they are extremely or very concerned about their children struggling with anxiety or depression or being bullied (48% each). But other concerns are also top of mind for lower-income parents: 44% are extremely or very concerned about their children being kidnapped or abducted, and similar shares are equally concerned about them getting beaten up or attacked (41%) or getting shot (40%). In fact, lower-income parents are four times as likely as upper-income parents to express concerns about their children being the victim of a shooting (10% of upper-income parents say they are extremely or very worried about their children getting shot).\n\nWhile parents in different income groups have different concerns, they largely share similar goals and aspirations for their children, with large majorities of lower-, middle- and upper-income parents saying it’s extremely or very important to them that their children be honest, ethical and hardworking as adults and that they be financially independent and have jobs or careers they enjoy. And relatively small shares – about one-in-five in each group – place a lot of importance on their children getting married and having children of their own in the future.\n\nThere are some differences, however, when it comes to the emphasis parents put on attaining a college degree: 46% of lower-income parents and 51% of upper-income parents say it is very or extremely important to them that their children earn a college degree, compared with 35% of middle-income parents. Looking at parents’ own educational attainment, 51% of those with a postgraduate degree say it’s extremely or very important to them that their children graduate from college, followed by 43% of those with a bachelor’s degree and 40% of those with a high school diploma or less education.

In contrast, those with upper incomes are more likely to say they are raising their children in a similar way to how they were raised (51%) than to say they’re raising them differently (41%).

About a third of upper-income parents (32%) say they push their children too hard, compared with 26% of middle-income and 20% of lower-income parents.

The pandemic was particularly debilitating for single-parent households—especially those headed by women, who still bear the brunt of domestic work.\n\nSingle-parent households already dealt with disproportionately high economic precarity compared to dual-parent households and other family structures prior to the pandemic. Between frequently relying on a single income, the expense of childcare, and a lack of robust resources available to help and protect single parents, these households experienced higher levels of economic insecurity than others. However, the onset of the pandemic widened existing disparities partially because of the concentrated effects of school and childcare closures.\n\nRELATED: Best Counties to Raise a Family in Illinois\n\nAs of 2019, the U.S. had the highest percentage of single-parent households in the world, with millions of solo guardians struggling to make ends meet on one income while performing all the labor of parenting day in and day out. Single parents are often faced with difficult or even impossible choices: whether to pay rent or buy food and whether to go to work or take care of a child.\n\nThe problem is even worse for single parents working low wage jobs, 93% of whom had no access to paid family and medical leave as of 2018. (As of 2022, 60% of the lowest 10% of all wage workers cannot earn paid sick days, compared to just 4% of the highest 10% of earners.)\n\nTo determine the states with the most single-parent households, Stacker used data from the U.S. Census American Community Survey 2021 five-year estimates.

But that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive. More references from Alan Hostetter to “crisis actors” on Jan 6', 'Full_text': 'A former police chief in La Habra, California, who went on to become a yoga instructor and a convicted felon for his actions on Jan. 6 was sentenced Thursday to more than 11 years in prison, but not before he claimed Ashli Babbitt isn’t actually dead — even as Babbitt’s mom looked on in court.\n\nAlan Hostetter, unlike his Three Percenter “DC Brigade” co-defendants found guilty by a jury in November, was convicted of four charges after a July bench trial before Senior U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas. He must reportedly surrender on or after Jan. 5, 2024.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://reason.com/2022/01/04/ashli-babbitts-violent-past-doesnt-justify-her-death/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's Violent Past Doesn't Justify Her Death - Reason.com"", 'Snippet': ""On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli Babbitt, the Capitol rioter who was shot and killed by a police officer while trying to enter the Speaker's Lobby on January 6. In ..."", 'Full_text': 'On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli Babbitt, the Capitol rioter who was shot and killed by a police officer while trying to enter the Speaker\'s Lobby on January 6. In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence.

She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.

In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house.

She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month.

When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt.

He could say ‘her’ or ‘she; or whatever. But he says ‘Ashli Babbitt’.""\n\nThat is how Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt, described the way Donald Trump talks about her daughter, who died one year ago today on 6 January, 2021, while trying to overturn the former president’s election defeat.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old US Air Force veteran from San Diego, California, was shot dead by a police officer as she climbed through the window of a barricaded door inside the Capitol building. She was part of a crowd of Trump supporters that had stormed the seat of the US Senate to stop it ratifying the election result, with some allegedly planning to do so by armed force.\n\nIn a less polarised era, American politicians in both parties might have rallied around the officer who shot her. Today, though, she has become a martyr to many of Mr Trump’s followers, praised and venerated by a movement that is increasingly willing to endorse political violence to keep its opponents out of power.\n\nRepublican members of congress including Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Matt Gaetz of Florida have taken up her cause, as have Fox News, the pro-Trump TV station Newsmax and even Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne right-wing group, Look Ahead America, has called for a vigil in Babbitt’s name for those in prison awaiting trial for their alleged actions on 6 January. Donations to a ""Justice for Ashli Babbitt legal fund"" continue to pour in, with more than $378,000 (£278,500) raised as of Wednesday.\n\nFollow live updates on the January 6 anniversary\n\nMr Trump himself has been her cheerleader in chief, referring to her death as a murder. and offering her family his ""unwavering"" support"". ""To Ashli’s family and friends, please know that her memory will live on in our hearts for all time,"" he said in a video specially filmed for her birthday on 10 October. ""There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli.""\n\nTerrorism experts and anti-racist groups find the former president’s intervention deeply disturbing, comparing it to the way Islamic fundamentalists and the Nazi Party in the 1940s used manufactured martyrs to inspire further acts of violence.\n\nFor Cara Castronuova, a pro-Trump activist who co-founded the group Citizens Against Political Persecution to advocate for alleged January 6 rioters, it is a vindication of many months fighting to reframe the storming of the Capitol as a peaceful protest and its alleged invaders as political prisoners.\n\n""At first her name was taboo, even in conservative media,"" Ms Castronuova tells The Independent. ""Nobody would talk about her, nobody would mention her, nobody would mention anybody’s name from 6 January. There was a three to four month block of time at the beginning of 2020... and then it just snowballed.""\n\nWho was Ashli Babbitt?\n\nWhen Ashli Babbitt quit the US military in 2016, she left at the rank of senior airman with 12 years of service and eight deployments behind her. Having enlisted in the US Air Force (USAF) straight out of high school in 2003, she protected bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, protected USAF bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Katar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAt one point, she had even guarded the seat of the US government, serving in an Air National Guard unit known as the ""Capital Guardians"" at a base near Washington DC. In 2013, she was part of the DC Air National Guard’s security detail for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nBabbitt grew up in Lakeside, California, not far from San Diego, the oldest sister to four younger brothers. One former classmate told Insider that she was ""disruptive"" in class, highly opinionated and always trying to be ""one of the guys"".\n\nThat bolshy nature survived throughout her service, with former comrades saying she struggled to be promoted and was demoted at least once due to spats with superiors. One friend described her as ""small but mighty"" (Babbitt was 5 feet 2 inches tall), unafraid to contradict her officers when she disagreed.\n\n""Ashli was headstrong and impulsive,"" said Sgt Eirik Blackwolf, who served with her in the DC Air National Guard. ""She didn’t hold back on her opinion to anyone, no matter their rank, especially if she thought they were wrong or behaving unethically.""\n\nDuring one deployment Babbitt was injured in a mortar strike that knocked her onto a pile of debris. Augustine Luna, a close friend, told Insider that the impact damaged Babbitt’s uterus and left her unable to bear children, but that Babbitt rarely mentioned this.\n\nIn 2015 Babbitt began working as a private security guard for a nuclear power plant in Maryland, where she met her future second husband Aaron Babbitt. That was also the year Mr Babbitt’s then-girlfriend Celeste Norris first encountered Ashli.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ms Norris said Mr Babbitt at first described the new girl as ""this foul-mouthed chick that’s on shift"". Later, Ms Norris found out the two were dating, and broke up with Mr Babbitt.\n\nThe next year, Ms Norris said, she was waiting at a stop sign when a white SUV barged through nearby traffic and repeatedly rammed into her car. When they stopped, Babbitt got out and began hammering with her hand on the window. ""It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was,"" said Ms Norris. ""Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.""\n\nA court acquitted Babbitt of criminal charges, but Ms Norris secured a restraining order against her, and later mounted a personal injury lawsuit that Babbitt settled out of court. In court documents from 2017, Ms Norris wrote that Babbitt had continued to follow her home from work and harass her. ""I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,"" she told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Babbitt moved to San Diego to help buy out and run a swimming pool supply company where her brothers, her uncle and her husband all worked together. ""It was kind of nice, a family affair,"" her brother Roger said.\n\nBabbitt and her husband became daily customers at a brewery near the San Diego sea front, often with their three ex-military dogs in tow. According to brewery owner Jim Millea, the pair had a polyamorous relationship with one of his bartenders. Babbitt herself often arrived fuming about a political issue that had grabbed her attention.\n\nYet the pool supply business quickly got into trouble. Babbitt took out a short term business loan with a steep interest rate and was sued by the lender for failing to make payments, ultimately being ordered by a judge to pay it all back. In 2019, she sold the house where her parents had lived for nearly 20 years, reportedly making them feel ""kicked out of their own home"".\n\nBy this time, Babbitt was a staunch Trump supporter and an opponent of lockdown measures. Her company’s office bore a sign reading: ""Mask-free autonomous zone, better known As America"".\n\nHer brother told the New York Times that she had felt free after leaving the military, and had been angry with the number of homeless people in San Diego and the challenges for small business owners.\n\nOne customer told CBS 8 San Diego that he dropped Babbitt’s company after she went on an unprovoked political rant. “She just started talking about people who oppose Trump and about Nancy Pelosi and [Chuck] Schumer and homeless people,"" the customer said. ""A lot of it didn’t even make any sense. It literally went on for about a minute and a half... it was shocking that she would be talking to a customer the way she was talking to me.""\n\nEven so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents. ""I don’t really know why she decided to do this,"" her mother-in-law toldFox 5 Washington DC last year.\n\nHer social media accounts, however, told an all too familiar story.\n\n‘Nothing will stop us’\n\nOn 7 September, 2020, tweeting under the username @CommonSenseAsh, Ashli Babbitt posted a photo of herself smiling in sunglasses and a black tank top, posing in front of an old-fashioned boat in the harbour of San Diego.\n\nTo many the photo might have looked innocuous, a happy selfie from a nice day out. But her shirt bore the slogan ""We are Q"" – a reference to the anonymous purported government insider who inspired the cult-like millenarian movement known as QAnon.\n\nFor almost a year, Babbitt had been posting in support of QAnon, which believes Mr Trump’s Democratic opponents are part of a global Satanist paedophile ring. Adherents think Mr Trump himself is the figurehead for a secret plot by ""white hats"" (ie, good guys) to sweep the Satanists from power in a military coup, resulting in mass imprisonment or execution.\n\nThe movement has been tied to violent acts including murders, kidnappings, terror plots, attempted bombings, and vehicular attacks, as well as campaigns of online harassment and death threats.\n\nBabbitt’s radical shift came gradually. Back in 2018, she had told another user that she had voted for Barack Obama and still believed he had done ""great things"", but had turned to Mr Trump because she could not stomach Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Ms Luna, Babbitt had voted for Trump in 2016 because he was not a career politician, but soon began calling Democrats ""commies"" and skirmished aggressively offline and online with anyone who disputed her anti-mask beliefs.\n\nIn November 2019, she tweeted about Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that went viral among Trump supporters in 2016 and was a key precursor to QAnon. Online activists had fixated on chance words in hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders as evidence of a secret child sex dungeon beneath a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. Later one of them stormed the restaurant with a rifle to rescue the supposed children, but found nothing.\n\nIn February 2020, Babbitt tweeted her first of many QAnon slogans. Most often she retweeted QAnon influencers such as the lawyer Lin Wood. Ms Luna told Insider that Babbitt was drawn in by the idea that children were in danger, spending hours every week reading about missing kids and appalled that QAnon’s claims were not being taken seriously in the mainstream media.\n\nAccording to Prof Mia Bloom, a terrorism researcher at Georgia University, QAnon’s appeals to ""save the children"" are ""almost verbatim"" how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) recruited three British schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, London, in 2015.\n\n""This kind of message that builds upon someone’s innate goodness is a very different pathway into terrorism than we ordinarily think,"" says Prof Bloom. ""We assume that it’s about hatred, it’s about violence, it’s about racism and white supremacy on the Right and jihadi ideology for [Islamic] groups, when in fact a lot of the pull factors can be based in what we would consider to be very positive attributes.""\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Babbitt did not accept the results of the 2020 election and plunged wholeheartedly into the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. On 1 January, 2021, Babbitt tweeted that she would be in Washington DC on the 6th for a rally addressed by Mr Trump.\n\nOn 5 January, she boarded a plane in San Diego and texted to her friend that there were ""tons of Trump supporters"" flying with her. Another user tweeted that some flights to DC were being cancelled, supposedly to prevent people from attending the 6 January rally.\n\nBabbitt replied: ""Nothing will stop us. They can try and try and try, but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.""\n\nWhen Trump’s army stormed the Capitol, Ashli Babbitt was among the mob that gathered in a stairwell near the chamber of the House of Representatives, where up to 80 members of congress and staff were sheltering. She was wearing a Trump flag on her shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe crowd began hammering on the doors out of the stairwell, which were barricaded from the other side with furniture. One window broke, and Ashli Babbitt, who was unarmed, climbed through. A gunshot rang out, and she fell back with a bullet in her shoulder.\n\nPro-Trump activists have found their George Floyd\n\nLast August, the police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt finally broke his silence. For months Lt Michael Byrd, who is black, had been in hiding due to repeated death threats and racist attacks after Mr Trump falsely claimed he worked for a ""high-ranking"" Democratic politician.\n\n""I know that day I saved countless lives,"" Lt Byrd told NBC News. “I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nBabbitt did not become a Trumpist hero overnight. The day after the riot, Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin, who saw Babbitt’s death, said that Lt Byrd had not had any choice. ""The mob was going to come through the door,"" he told ABC. ""There was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many Trump supporters believed she was a plant or a stooge, put into the crowd by the FBI or other dark forces. In April, the US Department of Justice closed its investigation with no criminal charges.\n\nBy the time of Lt Byrd’s interview, however, Babbitt’s name had become a clarion call in what Ms Castronuova calls the conservative ""underground"" of alternative media and social media. Ms Castronuova was among the first people to interview Babbitt’s family on InfoWars, a fringe news site that often promotes conspiracy theories and has been banned from most major social networks for hate speech.\n\n""[Trump] is really in tune with the community, his base,"" Ms Castronuova says. ""The underground will start to buzz, then Donald Trump picks up on it."" Soon enough, at rallies and in interviews last summer, Mr Trump was calling Babbitt ""an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman"", someone who was on his ""side"", and said there was ""no reason for"" her to die. Ms Castronuova says his backing was ""instrumental"".\n\nMr Trump’s efforts increased after a personal phone call to Mrs Witthoeft, who had become politically active. She has now spoken at a Trump rally and has backed her daughter’s actions, saying: ""She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.""\n\nMs Castronuova says: ""[Babbitt’s] mother has been really instrumental too. She became quite an advocate. She was afraid to speak out at first... but when she finally started speaking out, things really started to change.""\n\nBabbitt’s family sued the District of Columbia to uncover Lt Byrd’s identity, and plans to file wrongful death lawsuits against Lt Byrd himself and the Capitol Police. Terrell Roberts III, a lawyer for Babbitt’s husband Aaron, declined to comment and declined an interview on Mr Babbitt’s behalf.\n\nDonations to Mr Babbitt’s legal fund continue to roll in, with many donors identifying themselves as military veterans. Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating Democratic secrets.\n\nMany Trump supporters have compared Babbitt to George Floyd, a black man murdered by police in Minnesota, lifting the Black Lives Matter slogan ""say her name"" used in reference to many victims of police brutality.\n\nOn the private messaging app Telegram, which is popular on the far right, pro-Trump channels frequently invoke Babbitt’s name, sharing news articles about her family’s lawsuit or claiming that she was set up by informants. Many asked the question ""who killed Ashli Babbit?"" which Mr Trump later echoed.\n\n""The entire scenario looks to be staged. So who is the rotting fish head of what appears to be a deliberate false flag? Who or what group set this up?"" said the evangelist channel Veteran Patriots. The Proud Boys, a fascist militia, have begun using a stylised image of Babbitt as a logo, with the slogan: ""They can’t kill us all.""\n\nBritish radicals have also taken up her cause. ""Her name was Ashli Babbitt,"" said British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. ""She was murdered by the state and her name was dragged through the mud by the media."" An account identifying itself as former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has invoked her name several times.\n\nSome appear to believe she is not even dead. ""Ashli Babbitt false [is a] flag, she’s alive living underground,"" said a QAnon channel called Gitmo TV.\n\n‘A weapon of mass radicalisation’\n\nTo Prof Bloom, Babbitt’s transformation into an innocent victim of Leftist injustice has a worrying historical echo: Horst Wessel, the young Nazi street-fighter who was turned into a symbol of fascist heroism by Josef Goebbel’s propaganda apparatus.\n\nWessel was shot in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party, probably as part of a dispute over unpaid rent with his Communist landlady. By 1936, after the Nazis took power, official media referred to him as greater than Jesus Christ and the Horst Wessel Song was Germany’s joint national anthem.\n\n""Fake martyrdoms succeed because they feed off the shared grievances and anger of the crowd, serving as justification for future retaliatory violence,"" wrote Prof Bloom and another researcher, Sophia Moskalenko, with whom Prof Bloom has co-authored a book about QAnon. ""Ashli Babbitt’s unfortunate death is a weapon of mass radicalisation, just like Horst Wessel’s death was manipulated by Goebbels.""\n\nIndeed, the Nazis’ modern successors have particularly embraced Babbitt, turning an enthusiastic Trump supporter with a chequered past who was killed in a chaotic riot into a towering hero or innocent victim of police brutality while seeking to pin the blame on black and Jewish people.\n\n""Unlike ‘Saint Floyd’, Ashli Babbitt will receive no justice from this sick anti-white system,"" said one white supremacist Telegram channel. ""But we will always remember her sacrifice and she will never be forgotten. There is a day coming not far from now when we will erect statues in her honor.""\n\nThe same channel referred to Lt Byrd as a ""black parasite who gets to kill an unarmed white woman and walk around unbothered"", threatening to make him ""account for his actions"". Another neo-Nazi channel claimed that ""Ashli Babbitt was killed because she was white"".\n\nAlex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates against antisemitism and other forms of racism, says such messages are part of a widespread effort by white supremacists to lure recruits from the broader pro-Trump community.\n\n""White supremacists will always try to twist whatever major story is in the news to fit their agenda,"" says Mr Friedfeld. It’s unclear how successful these efforts have been, but the fact that they are trying to leverage the Babbitt story is deeply concerning because it raises the likelihood that someone is radicalised.""\n\nProf Bloom agrees, comparing it to the Proud Boys’ attempts last summer to recruit ""incel"" anti-feminists. She says that while many QAnon believers are not consciously racist, and not all are white, the movement has a pervasive racial bias, with trafficked children usually depicted as white whereas real world child trafficking disproportionately affects children of colour.\n\nProf Bloom also points out that another protester, Rosanne Boyland, died during the riot but has not been turned into a martyr in the same way. The reason, she argues, is that unlike Babbitt’s family, the Boyland’s have blamed Mr Trump for their loved one’s death.\n\nA threat from within America’s military\n\nThe martyrdom of Ashli Babbitt paints a foreboding picture of where American politics is going. To Prof Bloom and Prof Moskalenko, martyrs are a ubiquitous manufactured product of radical movements, useful because of their potency in rallying followers to stay in the fight and seek revenge against the enemy.\n\nMs Castronuova stops short of saying Babbitt was an example others should follow, describing her as a good person sucked into an ""emotionally charged"" and chaotic situation. She is happy to call Babbitt a martyr, claiming: ""She was killed because of her political beliefs, and they continue to kill her image and her memory because of her political beliefs. If she was a liberal and she hated Donald Trump, she would be remembered very fondly by the media.""\n\nMr Friedfelder, however, fears that Babbitt’s lionisation could contribute to an escalating cycle of conflict, and considers politicians’ embrace of Babbitt to be dangerous. While most Republicans have not embraced the idea that she was unjustly killed, few have publicly rebuked it, apparently reluctant to openly challenge Mr Trump even now he is out of office.\n\nThat does not mean they are happy behind the scenes. On Wednesday Mr Trump cancelled a press conference on the anniversary of the riot, reportedly under pressure from mainstream Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he had played golf with Mr Trump at the weekend and warned him that there ""could be peril"" in such an event. Still, history suggests that Mr Trump’s concessions to moderates are rarely permanent.\n\nMr Friedfelder says: ""Her martyrdom turns her into a call to action... it is one thing for extremists to embrace Babbitt, but it is another for the former president and several high-profile members of the Republican Party to do the same. These officials are supposed to be trusted figures and people look to them for guidance when trying to understand national events.""\n\nClaims that Babbitt was murdered or assassinated continue to spread on social media, according to data from the online discussion tracking firm Zignal Labs. Mr Trump’s and Mr Putin’s comments caused spikes in mentions of Babbitt, and the general discussion around 6 January has barely waned over the past year.\n\nProf Bloom believes there is a more acute threat too: Babbitt’s military record. According to a report from START, an academic coalition that studies terrorism, at least 118 of the 719 people charged in connection with the riot, about 16 per cent of the whole, are veterans. In a START extremism database, about 7 per cent of all far-right cases had military experience, with the rest simply listed as unknown.\n\n""We don’t know how many American military [members] have been radicalised, either by MAGA or specifically by QAnon and white supremacy,"" says Prof Bloom. ""There has been a problem of white supremacy in the military for decades that the military has been reticent to deal with.\n\n""It’s dangerous because it’s not just some flunky who wants to make a name for themselves. It’s someone with military training who has weapons and knows how to use them."" She compares most pro-Trump extremists with the bumbling jihadists in 2010’s Four Lions, with lots of anger but limited ways to direct it. ""When you have someone who has been trained by the military or law enforcement, they know how to use that anger.""\n\nProf Moskalenko worries that the conditions are set for yet more political violence in America. ""A martyrdom is a symbol of perceived widespread injustice and suffering. There’s a lot of that going around,"" she says. ""With or without Ashli Babbit, we have problems. Addressing them, rather than getting stuck in the never-ending cycle of rhetoric, competing narratives, and shifting moral frames, is our only hope.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2022-06-11/ashli-babbitt-family-not-filed-wrongful-death-suit-6307638.html', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt’s family still hasn’t filed wrongful death suit, report ...', 'Snippet': 'The family of Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt — the woman shot dead while storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — still hasn’t filed the wrongful-death suit for which their legal team ...', 'Full_text': '(Tribune News Service) — The family of Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt — the woman shot dead while storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — still hasn’t filed the wrongful-death suit for which their legal team raised $460,000, a news outlet in her former hometown reports.\n\nBabbitt was felled by a single shot fired by a Capitol Police officer defending members of Congress as rioters attempted to stop the certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral win. Lt. Michael Byrd, who was cleared of any wrongdoing, fired at Babbitt as she stormed through a door leading into the House of Representatives chamber.\n\nAccording to the CBS 8, an attorney for Babbitt’s family has made repeated claims he would file a $10 million wrongful-death suit on their behalf, but that has not happened. That attorney reportedly said last year the suit would be coming soon.\n\nNeither Babbitt’s widow or the family lawyer responded to the San Diego news station’s requests for information. The online fundraiser page says it “is currently disabled and can not receive new donations.”\n\nCBS said that Thursday’s opening arguments from the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol “hit close to home for San Diegans,” in light of Babbitt’s death. The 35-year-old Air Force veteran had reportedly become an adamant Trump loyalist who appeared to have bought into his lies about the election being stolen. Babbitt drove cross country to attend the “Stop the Steal” event where she found herself mortally wounded on the Capitol floor, wrapped in a Trump flag she was wearing as a cape.\n\nSome right-wingers have come to see Babbitt as a martyr. Others view Byrd and the police officers who fought off the attack as the heroes of Jan. 6. Trump said Babbitt was “murdered” and spread conspiracy theories about her killing.\n\nTerry Roberts, who represents Babbitt’s family, conceded in April 2021 that what Babbitt did may have been illegal, but claimed there was no need to shoot her.\n\n“There was just no legal justification to take her life,” he told WUSA. “We don’t shoot protesters in this country unless they’re an immediate threat to somebody.”\n\nByrd told NBC News in August that had Babbitt and her cohorts succeeded in entering the chamber, those inside would have no escape.\n\n“If they get through that door, they’re into the House chamber and upon the members of Congress,” the officer said.\n\nThe Department of Justice announced in April 2021 that an investigation into the incident revealed Byrd did not act improperly.\n\nIn September, Babbitt’s brother Roger Stefan Witthoeft was charged with a hate crime resulting from an altercation with a San Diego utility worker. According to The San Diego Union-Tribune, he unsuccessfully requested last month that a judge divert prosecution in that case on account of the “extreme stress and trauma” caused by his sister’s death. Witthoeft was also reportedly charged with battering a man he felt was slow in helping a disabled person get out of their car in January. He pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nNew footage revealed by the Jan. 6 Committee on mainstream news networks Thursday offered further insight into the violence of that occurred after Trump told followers once more that day the election had been stolen from him. Testimony leading up to the hearings seems to indicate people in the former president’s inner-circle, including his daughter Ivanka, did not believe the lie being pushed by the 45th president.\n\n©2022 New York Daily News.\n\nVisit at nydailynews.com.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://wgnradio.com/news/political-news/ashli-babbitt-a-martyr-her-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a martyr?

In a livestream from the protest captured by News2Share, a counterprotester heckled the demonstrators and blared the siren of her bullhorn. Witthoeft could be seen grabbing the bullhorn from her hand, pulling it away, and throwing it on the ground.\n\nThe counterprotester later reported the incident to police, who arrested her late Tuesday.\n\nWitthoeft’s arrest report indicates that the incident took place at 1801 E Street SE on May 29 at around 6:28 p.m. ET, and it was reported to police a little more than an hour later at 7:47 p.m. ET.\n\nThe report’s description of the incident is thin, and it says only that Witthoeft’s alleged victim reported being “assaulted” and “pushed” with an open hand.\n\nOn Jan. 6, Babbitt — motivated partly by her belief in QAnon conspiracy theories — joined a throng of pro-Donald Trump protesters at the Capitol. An Air Force veteran, Babbitt pushed to the barricaded doors of the Speaker’s Lobby, and she tried to climb through a broken window. She had been wearing a backpack then, and law enforcement warned rioters from entering the area. After Babbitt’s fatal shooting, a Capitol Police investigation cleared the officer who pulled the trigger of wrongdoing and commended him for protecting the Capitol.\n\n“The actions of the officer in this case potentially saved Members and staff from serious injury and possible death from a large crowd of rioters who forced their way into the U.S. Capitol and to the House Chamber where Members and staff were steps away,” U.S. Capitol Police wrote in a statement nearly two years ago. “USCP Officers had barricaded the Speaker’s Lobby with furniture before a rioter shattered the glass door. If the doors were breached, the rioters would have immediate access to the House Chambers. The officer’s actions were consistent with the officer’s training and USCP policies and procedures.”\n\nWhen that investigation concluded in August 2021, authorities had not released the name of the officer who pulled the trigger, citing “numerous credible and specific threats” against him.

Warren Petersen, who heads the judiciary committee, were telling Doug Logan and others involved in the “audit.”\n\nLogan heads Cyber Ninjas, the inexperienced firm the Senate hired to oversee the audit of computers and ballot counting machines and recount by hand 2.1 million ballots cast in 2020’s election in Maricopa County.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s win led former President Donald Trump to allege without evidence that he lost in Arizona and other battleground states because of fraud. The Senate then launched the review, which found the ballot count results were true.\n\nLogan’s report did raise a series of other claims about potential problems with the election, most since disproven. They include the potential for election equipment to be connected to the internet or that large numbers of ballots were cast by dead voters.\n\nREAD MORE: Across the country, Republican primaries feature candidates who deny outcome of 2020 election\n\nThe ruling written by Justice John Lopez says legislative privilege applies because the audit was part of an investigation that could conceivably lead to new election laws. That is enough to shield the approximately 1,000 emails, text messages and other communications the Senate refused to release.\n\n“The Audit is a legislative activity within the legislature’s authority, and communications concerning this activity are covered by legislative privilege,” Lopez wrote. “Consequently, the Senate’s internal communications concerning the authorization, planning, and findings of the Audit investigation are privileged.”\n\nThe ruling overturns both a trial court judge and the state court of appeals, which took narrow views of legislative privilege and held that the public had a right to know what senators discussed about the audit.\n\n“It’s a win for the Senate on every issue unanimously,” said Kory Langhofer, the Senate’s lawyer. “It couldn’t be a better ruling.”\n\nThe Senate will have to reveal any records that are political in nature or involve the administration of the audit itself, but the Senate had already agreed to do that.\n\nFann said in a statement that the Senate’s position that the records could be kept secret was supported by “decades of precedent” from state and federal courts.\n\n“We absolutely believe in transparency, however, there are times when legislative privilege should be exercised so that we can do the jobs that the people of Arizona elected us to carry out,” Fann said.\n\nThe public records lawsuit the court decided was filed by a watchdog group called American Oversight, which pushes for government transparency, shortly after the audit was launched in spring 2021.\n\nThe Senate disclosed more than 20,000 records after court orders prompted by lawsuits filed by American Oversight and the Arizona Republic, orders that the Supreme Court refused to block last year. But it withheld all or part of about 1,000 other documents, citing legislative privilege meant to promote robust debate among elected officials.\n\nWATCH: Primary victories showcase strength of the ‘Big Lie’ in the Republican Party\n\nThe court of appeals said privilege did not apply because the audit was mainly political, no legislation was being considered and the Senate failed to show releasing the documents would impair its deliberations. The Supreme Court rejected those findings, which American Oversight said will keep important information hidden from public view.\n\n“While legislative privilege should protect legitimate functions of the legislature, extending the privilege to activities that the Court recognized as uniquely politicized is misguided,” American Oversight Executive Director Heather Sawyer said in a statement. “This ruling makes it easier for officials to hide the truth about their motives and conduct from the public.”\n\nThe high court ordered the judge who issued the initial ruling saying the records must be released to review an updated “privilege log,” filed by the Senate’s lawyers. But the Supreme Court said the judge cannot review the records to make sure the Senate is not withholding records that should be released.\n\nIn concluding his ruling, Lopez noted that disputes over the 2020 election continue to be “a central focus of the political realm, a matter outside this Court’s constitutional prerogative.”\n\nHe said the ruling followed longstanding precedent preserving separation of powers and guards lawmaker’s ability to do their jobs without undue interference. And he said if the public does not like what they do, they have a way to deal with that.\n\n“Arizona legislators routinely stand for election and, thus, are accountable to the state’s electorate who serve as the ultimate arbiters of the wisdom of any legislative action, rather than the courts,” Lopez wrote.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/got-arizona-audit-timeline-002116065.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr', 'Headline': 'How we got here: An Arizona election audit timeline - Yahoo', 'Snippet': ""Debate over Arizona's 2020 election, in which Joe Biden's victory helped send him to the White House, has continued nearly nonstop for almost a year."", 'Full_text': 'The debate over Arizona\'s 2020 general election, in which Joe Biden\'s victory helped send him to the White House, has continued nearly nonstop for more than year.\n\nProtests and lawsuits were immediate.

Our reporters stay on top of it all. Subscribe now to azcentral.com.\n\n2020: A contentious election\n\nNov. 3: Election night tallies show Joe Biden defeating then-President Donald Trump in Arizona, although the race remains tight with many votes left to count. Trump says he plans to go to the U.S. Supreme Court to prevent states from counting outstanding ballots late into the night, which he calls a “fraud.” However, in Arizona, Trump says there are many votes left to count and that he shouldn\'t be discounted yet.\n\nNov. 4: Protests and election lawsuits begin. Some 100 people rally at the state Capitol. Republican State Rep. Kelly Townsend urges them to sign affidavits about their voting experience and to contact Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward. An election lawsuit related to the use of Sharpies is filed, despite election officials across Arizona saying the use of the felt-tip pen to fill out ballots is not a problem. The case is dropped three days later.\n\nToward evening, more people gather outside the Maricopa County election center as workers continue to count votes.\n\nRepublican Clint Hickman, chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and Supervisor Steve Gallardo, the board\'s only Democrat, issue a bipartisan request for patience, saying an accurate vote count takes time. ""It\'s possible the results you see now may change after all the votes are counted. This is evidence of democracy, not fraud.""\n\nNov. 5: Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones rallies people outside the county elections center in Phoenix. “The world is watching the example of Arizona, the president is watching the example, you’re not gonna let ‘em steal this,"" Jones tells the crowd.\n\nNov. 7: Arizona continues counting ballots, but Biden is projected to win Pennsylvania, which pushes him across the 270 electoral college threshold. Meanwhile, a pressure campaign on Maricopa County leaders by the state GOP chair begins. Text messages and voicemails reveal multipronged attempts by Ward to halt Trump’s impending loss in Arizona.\n\nNov. 13: Maricopa County completes its final count, showing Biden beat Trump. Hours later, Ward texts Hickman: “POTUS will probably be calling you.” Hickman later tells The Arizona Republic that the call didn\'t come until New Year\'s Eve, and he let the White House switchboard go to voicemail.\n\nNov. 22: State leaders face pressure, too. Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani call Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers. The pair expresses concerns about widespread election fraud and suggests Bowers can help, saying Arizona law allows the state Legislature — rather than voters — to choose its electors.\n\nBowers, when telling Arizona Republic reporters about the phone call months later, says he expressed skepticism and sought evidence. “You are giving me nothing but conjecture and asking me to break my oath and commit to doing something I cannot do because I swore I wouldn\'t. I will follow the Constitution,” he tells Trump and Giuliani.\n\nNov. 30: Giuliani and others gather in a downtown Phoenix hotel presenting election fraud theories. The goal seems to be to persuade Arizona legislators to intercede with the state\'s election results. At the Capitol, state officials officially certify the results showing Trump lost. Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican who campaigned with Trump, expresses confidence in the process. ""We do elections well here in Arizona,"" he says.\n\nDec. 1: Giuliani and other Trump allies, such as Jenna Ellis and retired Army Col. Phil Waldron, meet with Republican lawmakers, including Bowers and Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, in a state Senate meeting room. Ellis claims lawmakers can replace the state\'s 11 presidential electors, whose votes are supposed to go to Biden, with electors for Trump.\n\nBowers leaves the meeting underwhelmed by the fraud claims and unwilling to seek to replace electors. “We were being asked to do something huge, and we thought we were going to get the evidence at the meeting,” he later tells The Republic.\n\nDec. 4: Bowers and Fann issue a joint statement calling for an independent audit of Maricopa County’s Dominion Voting Systems software and voting machines. Bowers is looking to work cooperatively with the county and with accredited experts.\n\nOne America News personality Christina Bobb emails Fann on behalf of Giuliani offering what they viewed as pertinent information and a promise of continued contact. “Good morning, Ma’am,” Bobb writes. “Mayor Giuliani asked me to send you these declarations. He will follow up with you as well.”\n\nDec. 8: Bowers, Fann, Hickman and attorneys and staffers for all sides meet via Zoom to cooperatively discuss issues such as how ballots are counted, the status of election-related lawsuits and how an accredited firm could review Dominion Voting Systems software and voting machines.\n\nDec. 9: Bowers and Fann acknowledge to each other that members of the GOP caucuses want public hearings. Bowers would later relay to The Republic that he is concerned about adding to ""the circus,"" but Fann says they need to do something. Bowers agrees to a joint House-Senate committee hearing on one condition: No subpoenas would demand the county produce information. He wants to work cooperatively with county officials rather than to create a legal battle.\n\nMeanwhile, thinking the last of at least eight unsuccessful election lawsuits is over, the Board of Supervisors brings in two officials from Pro V&V, an Alabama company accredited by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, to examine the Dominion machines. While they are in the air, Hickman learns that Ward, the state GOP chair, will appeal her case. The pair fly out of Phoenix the next day as the county, during litigation, doesn\'t want anyone to touch the machines, which could be considered evidence.\n\nDec. 10: Fann and state Sen. Eddie Farnsworth, R-Gilbert, a longtime friend of Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, an outspoken Trump ally, meet with county representatives without Bowers and the House. The senators tell county staff they intend to hold an election-related hearing without the House and raise the issue of subpoenas. Ahead of the hearing, Fann tells Bowers her caucus is moving ahead on its own. “OK. Good luck,” he recalls telling her. Bowers tells The Republic that Fann\'s decision is one of the ""nagging mysteries,"" saying he has no idea why she shifted away from a cooperative, joint audit.\n\nDec. 14: County officials spend the day answering questions at the Senate hearing. At the end, Farnsworth announces he will issue subpoenas.\n\nDec. 15: Arizona Senate Republican leaders send subpoenas to Maricopa County for all ballots cast in the November election, voting machines, voter rolls and more information for ""forensic analysis."" One of the demands is for ""ranked-choice voting,"" which is not something Arizona uses. This suggests that Farnsworth did not write the subpoenas.\n\nDec. 17: Bowers texts Hickman to express his disappointment with the Senate\'s approach. The county supervisor responds: ""Thank you for sticking with us. It’s called rational leadership in irrational times and I am positive history will be kind to us.”\n\nDec. 18: The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors files suit to fight the subpoenas, saying they are too broad and would violate voters\' privacy.\n\nDec. 24: Giuliani calls County Supervisor Jack Sellers. “I’m hoping we could have a chance to have a conversation,” a transcription of Giuliani’s message to Sellers says. “I’d like to see if there’s a way that we can resolve this so that it comes out well for everyone. We’re all Republicans, I think we have the same goal. … Let’s see if we can get this done outside of the court, gosh.” Sellers does not return the call.\n\n2021: The ballot recount and more\n\nJan. 6: Biggs calls Bowers and asks if he would support decertifying Arizona\'s electors. Bowers says he would not. Later that day, Biggs stands on the floor of the House of Representatives and urges his colleagues to set aside electors from Arizona, Georgia and other states. Before the House votes to reject Biggs’ arguments, hundreds of Trump supporters break into the U.S. Capitol, sparking a deadly riot.\n\nJan. 12: With the start of new legislative terms, Fann and state Sen. Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert, who replaced the retired Farnsworth as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, reissue a subpoena to the county for its ballots and election equipment.\n\nJan. 27: The county\'s Board of Supervisors votes to conduct an audit to try to put election integrity concerns to rest, but Fann says it doesn\'t go far enough.\n\nFeb. 5: Fann communicates with Doug Logan, who owns a small cybersecurity firm in Florida called Cyber Ninjas. This early communication would become publicly known months later in response to a public records request. Logan, at this point, already was working with Trump allies to uncover election fraud.\n\nFeb. 8: The Arizona Senate votes on whether to hold the Board of Supervisors in contempt for not fully responding to the subpoenas. Such a vote could lead to the arrest of the county\'s elected supervisors. Amid tensions leading up to the vote, Hickman tells the Senate chief of staff of protests at his home — one that drew 90 angry people and evoked fears of the riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThat morning, state Sen. Paul Boyer, R-Glendale, and Supervisors Bill Gates and Sellers gather in Fann’s office. Gates lays out his case: The supervisors were in court over the subpoenas, seeking direction from a judge. By the county’s reading of the law, the ballots and machines had to remain locked up for a certain period after the election. Either way, he says, the county needed clarity from the court, and a judge would decide soon.\n\n“We’re in court to get direction,"" Gates remembers saying. ""You don’t need to do this. Why would you?” Fann says no one will get jailed and that it is a procedural move to compel information. She takes the contempt charge to a vote on the Senate floor. Boyer is the lone Republican to vote against it, leading to its defeat.\n\n“My no vote today will give the board time to resolve itself on how to legally proceed with providing these public records for independent sunshine and scrutiny, while also providing 100% protection for the private nature of an individual’s vote,"" Boyer says.\n\nFeb. 23: Auditors hired by the county found no malicious hardware on voting machines, the machines were not connected to the internet, and the machines were programmed to tabulate ballots accurately.\n\nFeb. 26: Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Timothy Thomason rules the legislative subpoenas are valid. County officials say they will work to provide the materials.\n\nFeb. 27: Fann sends a text message to Waldron, the retired Army colonel and Trump ally who cast himself as an election-security expert, to inquire about Logan, the Cyber Ninjas CEO. Fann says she felt ""more comfortable"" after Waldron vouched for Logan.\n\nMarch 10: Hundreds of people flock to Queen Creek, southeast of Phoenix, for an event promoted by the Arizona Republican Party: ""The Mike Lindell Election Integrity, Faith and Freedom” event, which was sponsored by We the People Alliance AZ. “Arizona is going to pave the way,” Lindell, the CEO of My Pillow and an ardent Trump supporter, says to cheers. “We are chosen for such a time as this by God.”\n\nMarch 31: Fann announces Cyber Ninjas will lead the Senate\'s audit. The firm has no election auditing experience, but Logan has touted widespread election fraud claims on social media. Election experts say the $150,000 price tag is too low and raises concerns about partisanship, the time frame and the lack of transparency.\n\nApril 22: The Arizona Democratic Party and county Supervisor Gallardo sue to stop the audit because of security and other concerns. The lawsuit is filed the same day the county begins delivering the ballots, voting machines and other requested materials to Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix, which is leased for the hand recount.\n\nApril 23: Journalists initially are denied entry to observe the audit unless they sign up as a volunteer observer. The recount begins with one reporter in the coliseum who signed up to work a six-hour shift as a volunteer observer. The Republic\'s Jen Fifield questions Cyber Ninjas\' CEO about blue pens she spots on the recount tables. Voting machines can read black and blue ink, which is why recounts should use an alternative color. After checking, Logan has blue pens removed and replaced with green pens before any real ballots are taken out of the boxes.\n\nMaricopa County Superior Court Judge Christopher Coury, concerned by uncertainties about the audit procedures, orders the Arizona Senate to ""pause"" its recount if the state Democratic Party, which asked for the halt, posts a $1 million bond to cover any costs from the delay. The Democratic Party does not post the bond, and the audit continues.\n\nApril 27: Local journalists obtain limited access to the coliseum during the recount.\n\nApril 28: A judge requires Cyber Ninjas to provide the audit procedures it fought to keep secret.\n\nApril 30: Republic reporter Ryan Randazzo is removed from the coliseum and told his press privileges are revoked after posting a photo showing a former Republican legislator at a ballot-counting table. The photo shows a ballot, with no markings discernible, on a vertical stand in front of former state Rep. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale. The Senate later reverses its revocation of Randazzo\'s access.\n\nMay 5: The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division sends a letter questioning the Arizona Senate about the audit’s security and potential for voter intimidation.\n\nMay 6: The Republic reports that efforts to recruit people to recount ballots appear targeted in part at traditionally conservative groups — and some of the recruiters have far-right political ties.\n\nMay 7: Fann drops a controversial plan to go door to door to ask local residents about their voting history as part of its audit. The decision to halt the canvassing portion of the audit is in response to the DOJ\'s inquiry.\n\nMay 7: Maricopa County officials refuse to provide access to its computer routers. Sheriff Paul Penzone calls the demand ""mind-numbingly reckless and irresponsible,"" saying it could compromise law enforcement data.\n\nMay 12: Fann asks county officials to meet to answer questions, saying she wants to ""constructively resolve these issues and questions without recourse to additional subpoenas or other compulsory process."" The audit\'s Twitter account strikes a different tone, accusing the county of deleting election databases and spoliation of evidence.\n\nMay 14: The original deadline to complete the hand recount comes and goes. The Senate has extended its coliseum lease through June 30.\n\nMay 15: Trump alleges, among other things, ""The entire Database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been DELETED!"" and calls it an ""election crime."" Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican elected in November, responds on Twitter: ""Wow. This is unhinged. I’m literally looking at our voter registration database on my other screen. Right now.""\n\nMay 17: Sellers blasts Fann for trying to legitimize ""a grift disguised as an audit."" As for the files Fann said were missing, the county says contractors likely failed to properly download or search the county\'s databases, which made it so database and directories appeared to be missing. ""We wouldn’t be asked to do this on-the-job training if qualified auditors had been hired to do this work,"" Sellers says. The Senate\'s contractors would later tell Fann that they found the files in question.\n\nMay 20: Arizona\'s top election official, Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, says she may not allow the county to reuse hundreds of vote-counting machines provided, after a subpoena, to Fann\'s contractors. Replacing the machines could cost millions.\n\nMay 22: An email obtained by The Republic shows a nonprofit started by former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne will handle background checks, nondisclosure agreements and volunteer agreements of audit workers. Byrne\'s nonprofit also is raising money for the audit. Byrne wrote ""The Deep Rig,"" a book turned movie claiming election fraud.\n\nMay 24: Scottsdale-based technology company StratTech Solutions takes over running the hand count when Pennsylvania-based Wake TSI doesn\'t renew its contract past May 14.\n\nJune 2: The audit is a boon to the Arizona Republican Party, which has raised far more money this year than it did at this point last year, The Republic reports. Leaders in other states are paying attention. Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a Republican, visits the coliseum with colleagues and says he wants an Arizona-style audit in his state. Others from states such as Alaska, Wisconsin and Georgia follow.\n\nJune 3: Maricopa County election data is in a ""secure lab"" in Montana, or maybe a log cabin in the woods. The Republic reports that a contractor hired by the Arizona Senate is reviewing the election data from an undisclosed location in Montana, with no oversight from state or county officials.\n\nJune 26: The CEO of the company leading the audit appears in a new movie called ""The Deep Rig"" that asserts the election was stolen from Trump. ""If we don’t fix our election integrity now, we may no longer have a democracy,"" Logan says in the film that premiered in Phoenix. The film is based on a book by Byrne and features former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nJune 28: Maricopa County will not reuse voting machines that were in the custody of the Senate\'s contractors. The county Board of Supervisors sends a letter to the Arizona secretary of state that the board shares her concerns about whether the hundreds of vote-counting machines that they had to give the Senate\'s contractors are safe to use, in part considering the contractors are not certified to handle election equipment in the U.S.\n\nJune 30: The Republic files a special action in Maricopa County Superior Court seeking financial records and communications about the audit from the Senate and lead contractor Cyber Ninjas.\n\nJuly 1: The county\'s ballots and voting machines are moved out of the coliseum as the Senate\'s lease ends and into a swamp-cooled building at the state fairgrounds.\n\nJuly 8: Fann says the Senate will conduct its own recount of the total number of county ballots cast in the general election. The Senate purchased two paper-counting machines to serve as a check on the work done by its contractor and county elections officials. But the attorney hired by the Cyber Ninjas to help run its audit is now helping the Senate with its check, raising questions about its independence.\n\nJuly 14: County supervisors vote to spend $2.8 million to buy new voting equipment to replace the machines that were in custody of the Senate\'s contractors during the review.\n\nJuly 15: Logan meets with Fann and Petersen in a public hearing to share some of his findings and what he needs to complete the review, including the county\'s routers.\n\nJuly 23: A thunderstorm leads to a leaky roof at the state fairgrounds building where the review continues. Workers quickly move ballot boxes away from the leaks and cover boxes with tarps. ""No ballots are at risk,"" an audit spokesperson says.\n\nJuly 23: Ken Bennett, whom state Senate leaders put in charge as their liaison to the election review, is banned from the building where the work is happening and weighs stepping down. The decision to block Bennett came after learning he secretly shared initial results from a new ballot count with an outside group, according to Randy Pullen, another Senate spokesperson and former chairman of the state GOP. Bennett eventually regains access and continues in his role.\n\nJuly 26: GOP Senate leaders file another subpoena for the county\'s routers and other election items. They also issue a subpoena to Dominion Voting Systems for user names, passwords, tokens and pins to its machines.\n\nJuly 29: Workers at the state fairgrounds load nearly 2.1 million ballots onto trucks and return them to the county, ending the more than three-month process of reviewing ballots and other election equipment. And Cyber Ninjas releases long-sought details on who funded the audit, which was far pricier than the $150,000 that the state Senate agreed to pay. A handful of nonprofits whose leaders pushed the election fraud narrative have poured more than $5.6 million into the audit so far. Among the leaders are Byrne, Flynn, former Trump attorney Sidney Powell and far-right One America News Network correspondent Christina Bobb.\n\nAug. 2: County supervisors and Dominion Voting Systems refuse to produce election materials in response to the Senate\'s new subpoenas. ""The board has real work to do and little time to entertain this adventure in never-never land,"" Sellers says.\n\nAug. 5: Fann and other Republicans in her caucus are fighting to keep secret the records of the audit despite a judge\'s order that they ""immediately"" hand over all communications related to the effort.\n\nAug. 18: County supervisors lodge a notice of claim with the Arizona Senate for more than $2.8 million it spent replacing vote-counting machines that were potentially compromised as a result of the election review.\n\nAug. 23: The Cyber Ninjas\' draft report is expected this day, but instead, Fann announces Logan and several members of his team are sick with COVID-19.\n\nAug. 26: Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich says the county could lose millions in state-shared funding if it doesn\'t turn over routers the state Senate subpoenaed.\n\nAug. 30: Fann had put canvassing on hold as part of the audit, but a local group continues its efforts to go door to door to learn more about voters. Chandler real estate agent Liz Harris has led a canvassing effort known as the “Voter Integrity Project” since December, mobilizing thousands of volunteers, The Republic reports.\n\nAug. 31: The Arizona Senate releases texts and emails that offer glimpses into the audit but withholds thousands of other documents. Two judges had ordered the Senate to turn over the records. The documents show Cleta Mitchell, a prominent Republican attorney who advised Trump as he tried to overturn the 2020 election, helped set up an escrow account to funnel money to companies working on the audit. The documents also show the state Senate hired Shiva Ayyadurai, a conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine activist, to review voter signatures on the county\'s mail-in ballot envelopes.\n\nSept. 3: The Republic reports Arizona taxpayers have footed nearly $425,000 for the costs of the audit Senate Republicans are conducting, with thousands of dollars more in bills yet to come. The largest expense is for $223,000 in legal fees paid through July, followed by $68,100 for security costs at the state fairgrounds in May, state records show.\n\nSept. 15: Fann directs the CEO of Cyber Ninjas to turn over all communications related to the election audit after the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a lower court\'s order for the Senate to make the Cyber Ninjas\' documents public as part of a public-record lawsuit. The Republic and a left-leaning watchdog group called American Oversight both sued the Senate when Fann and the other members did not grant requests for emails, texts and other communications concerning the audit.\n\nSept. 16: Fann says the Arizona Senate will receive the audit report at 1 p.m. Sept. 24.\n\nSept. 17: County supervisors and state Senate leaders strike a settlement related to reviewing the county\'s routers as part of the election review. The county raised security concerns about giving the Senate\'s contractors access to the routers. Under the deal, the contractors will not have access to the routers, but the county will hire former U.S. Rep. John Shadegg to answer the Senate\'s questions about the routers. The county also agrees to no longer seek Senate repayment for potentially compromised voting machines.\n\nSept. 22: County Supervisor Steve Chucri announces he will resign after recordings surface of him talking about the 2020 election and his county colleagues. In the leaked recordings, Chucri bashed other supervisors for their lack of support for the Senate\'s audit and indicated he thought there were fraudulent votes cast in the election. Chucri, in announcing his resignation, said the comments were made at a ""very turbulent time"" and that ""the election was not stolen. (Joe) Biden won.""\n\nSept. 23: An early version of the Cyber Ninjas\' report obtained by The Republic shows that the hand recount confirmed what was announced in November: Biden won. The draft reports reviewed by The Republic minimize the ballot counts and instead focus on issues that raise questions about the election process and voter integrity. Meanwhile, American Oversight asks a judge to find the Arizona Senate in contempt of a court order for not turning over Cyber Ninjas\' emails and other records from the election audit.\n\nSept. 24: Results of the election review are presented to the Arizona Senate Republicans who ordered it. Election conspiracists loyal to Trump had believed a thorough review would show county elections officials didn\'t get it right, but Fann dashes their hopes. She confirms in her opening remarks the hand recount of ballots shows Biden won the election in Maricopa County, cementing his win in Arizona. “That is a true statement,"" Fann says as a packed audience in the Senate gallery listens quietly.\n\nShe adds, though, that she believes there were ""broken statutes"" and flawed election procedures — issues she will turn over to the state attorney general to investigate. In a letter to Brnovich, Fann says the Senate is already working on legislation to ensure Arizona has “an unimpeachable election process.”\n\nSept. 26: Election experts say the Arizona Senate had a chance to do something extraordinary when it set out to audit the county\'s election results but instead hired partisan contractors who didn\'t have knowledge of elections and used questionable methods. The results, they say, did nothing to strengthen elections. The Senate\'s election review only sows doubts — just as it was designed to do, they say.\n\nSept. 28: Arizona Attorney General Brnovich, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate, takes initial steps to investigate the 2020 presidential election, directing the county to hold onto records and asking the Senate to share evidence gathered by its contractors.\n\nMeanwhile, the results of the election review don\'t stop misinformation. A far-right news outlet, Gateway Pundit, publishes a doctored version of the Cyber Ninjas\' draft report saying Maricopa County\'s election should be decertified. Logan, who led the ballot review, told The Republic he never recommended decertifying the county\'s election.\n\nNov. 1: Fann announces she will retire from the Legislature when her current term ends in January 2023.\n\nNov. 15: Three nationally recognized election experts issue a report saying Cyber Ninjas\' hand count cannot be validated or replicated. Their report comes after reviewing tallies on every vote counted by the Cyber Ninjas. The Senate on Nov. 1 released nearly 80,000 images of tally sheets related to the hand count. ""We have tried dozens of ways to include and exclude various boxes and batches to arrive at those precise figures and have been unable to replicate their announced results,"" The Audit Guys write. Logan calls the claims ""outlandish,"" false and libelous. Logan does not respond to questions about the report or identify anything in it that he considered untrue.\n\nNov. 23: Boyer, who cast the deciding vote against holding the Board of Supervisors in contempt for not responding fully to the Senate subpoenas, says he will leave the Legislature when his term expires in January 2023. The Glendale Republican describes a ""toxic"" atmosphere at the Capitol and says he\'s lost the enthusiasm to seek a third Senate term amid what was likely to be a bruising primary challenge.\n\nDec. 22: Public-records lawsuits filed by the nonprofit organization American Oversight and another filed by The Arizona Republic continue to be heard in Arizona courts. Every ruling in the cases has ordered Cyber Ninjas to turn over records with a nexus to the audit, but the firm thus far has failed to do so.\n\nCyber Ninjas, in addition to arguing unsuccessfully that audit-related documents are not public records, contends it can\'t afford the cost of producing records, nor the cost of preparing a detailed log of redacted items. The Republic\'s attorney, David Bodney, sent a letter to Cyber Ninjas\' law firm warning that The Republic likely will seek legal fees not only from Cyber Ninjas but from their lawyers as well because they continue to withhold the records.\n\n""Cyber Ninjas’ flouting of the Arizona Public Records Law has been enabled through its assertion of meritless legal positions, its disobedience of court orders, its repetition of rejected legal theories, and its interpretation of those orders in a manner that twists them beyond recognition,"" Bodney wrote.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/maricopa-county-election-officials-to-rebut-claims-in-arizona-ballot-audit', 'Headline': 'Maricopa Co. releases new report on 2020 election, deems many claims ...', 'Snippet': ""Lawyer for Arizona Senate election audit firm wants to quit Far too little vote fraud to tip 2020 election to Trump, AP review finds Arizona Senate can't claim legislative privilege for 2020 ..."", 'Full_text': 'Election officials in Arizona have presented a point-by-point rebuttal of a controversial review of the 2020 election that former President Donald Trump and many of his supporters have used to promote the myth that Trump lost because of fraud.\n\nThe report, titled ‘Correcting the Record: Maricopa County’s In-Depth Analysis of the Senate Inquiry,\' was released on Jan. 5, and officials say it is the final word to the inquiry on the county\'s administration of the November 2020 election.\n\nElection administrators and the mostly Republican leaders of Maricopa County have always maintained that the review, conducted by Trump supporters on behalf of state Senate Republicans, was flawed.\n\nHere\'s what you need to know about the report.\n\nWho authorized the review?\n\nThe review was authorized by the Republican-controlled state Senate, which subpoenaed the election records from Maricopa County and selected the inexperienced, pro-Trump auditors.\n\nRelated: Election conspiracies live on with audit by Arizona GOP\n\n""The audit will validate every area of the voting process to ensure the integrity of the vote,"" read a portion of a statement released by Senate Republicans in March 2021.\n\nThe review began with a sweeping subpoena issued by Senate Republican leaders in late 2020 as Trump and his allies searched in vain for evidence to support his claim the election was stolen. The subpoena demanded access to all 2.1 million ballots, the machines that counted them and troves of digital election data from Maricopa County, home to the Phoenix metro area and 60% of Arizona voters.\n\nTo lead the review, Republican lawmakers hired Cyber Ninjas, a small cybersecurity consultancy with no experience in elections and led by a Trump supporter who shared conspiracy theories about the election on a Twitter account that he later deleted.\n\nWhat was the result of the review?\n\nThe review ended in September 2021 without producing proof to support former President Donald Trump’s claims of a stolen election.\n\nThe Cyber Ninjas report confirmed Biden’s narrow victory in Maricopa County but claimed a number of shortcomings in election procedures and suggested the final tally still could not be relied upon. Trump has repeatedly pointed to those claims in his rallies and public statements.\n\nCyber Ninjas and other contractors alleged that election computers were connected to the internet, that there were tens of thousands of potentially illegally cast ballots and that the county purged computer files that could contain evidence of fraud.\n\nWhat did Maricopa County officials say in their rebuttal?\n\nThe detailed response presented in a public meeting of the county Board of Supervisors on Jan. 5 rebutted virtually all the claims made by contractors hired by the state Senate to review its election procedures, equipment, voter registration rolls and ballot tabulation.\n\nThe report said that after ""an in-depth analysis and review of the reports and presentations issued by the Senate’s contractors, we determined that nearly every finding included faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions, and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws.""\n\nSpecifically, Maricopa County officials say of the claims made by the various entities connected to the audit:\n\n22 were found to be misleading. ""The claims lead the reader to assume a conclusion that is not supported by the evidence,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n41 were found to be inaccurate. ""The claims include flawed or misstated analysis,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n13 were found to be false. ""The claims are demonstrably false and can be proven false using materials provided to the Senate,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n""If you are biased or not using an objective process, you’re likely to come to a faulty conclusion,"" said Scott Jarrett, director of the county Elections Department.\n\nDid the county find issues when they analyzed the State Senate report?\n\nThe county experts did find some issues when they analyzed claims in the Senate report. The county review validated only a handful of the 33,000 ballots that the Senate report said could have been illegally cast because voters had moved prior to the election.\n\nFive voters were identified as having voted in more than one county, and six people may have voted twice in Maricopa County. The county report also found 27 cases where ballots were counted that were cast by people who died before they were returned in the mail; those were referred to the state attorney general for more investigation and possible prosecution.\n\nThe county is reviewing another 100 cases involving people who died close to the election but still cast ballots. The Senate report had identified 298 voters who had potentially cast a ballot but died before the election.\n\nIn all, the county found 38 instances were a ballot may have been illegally cast, and all have been sent to the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe county report also said that election workers had inadvertently double counted a batch of 50 ballots.\n\nCould the findings affect the 2020 election results?\n\nThe number of vote counting errors and potential illegal votes would not have affected the outcome of the election. President Joe Biden won Maricopa County by about 45,000 votes, key to his 10,500-vote win of Arizona. Previous reviews of the 2.1 million county ballots by nonpartisan professionals that followed state law have found no significant problem with the vote count in the county, which includes metro Phoenix.\n\nDid the county conduct its own audit?\n\nYes, according to officials.\n\n""After the November 2020 General Election, the County hired two federally certified Voting System Test Laboratories to conduct an audit of the tabulation equipment used to count ballots for all five of the elections administered in 2020,"" read a portion of the report.\n\nAccording to the report, both labs found no anomalies in the tabulation equipment. They also found that:\n\nCertified software were used for all tested software, systems and equipment\n\nNo malware or malicious hardware were installed\n\nNo evidence of internet connectivity was found\n\nOne of the two labs also found the 2020 General Election program and tabulation equipment was accurate, according to county officials. The test was only done by one of that two labs.\n\nWhere can the report be found?\n\nThe report has been uploaded to the Maricopa County Recorder\'s Office website, and can be read here.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to host a rally Jan. 15 outside Florence, his second in Arizona since his election loss.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) contributed to this report.\n\nContinued Coverage\n\nLawyer for Arizona Senate election audit firm wants to quit\n\nFar too little vote fraud to tip 2020 election to Trump, AP review finds\n\nArizona Senate can\'t claim legislative privilege for 2020 election audit records, judge rules\n\nCourt rejects another request to keep Arizona audit public records private\n\nTune in to FOX 10 Phoenix for the latest news'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2023/06/12/new-cyber-ninjas-text-2021-arizona-audit/70299020007/', 'Headline': ""Why new texts about what happened at 2021 Arizona 'audit' matter"", 'Snippet': '0:04. 0:58.

The texts undermine claims ...', 'Full_text': 'The truth behind the Arizona Senate\'s ""audit"" of 2020 election results is emerging in thousands of private text messages from Cyber Ninjas\' CEO Doug Logan.\n\nThe texts undermine claims the ""audit"" was a nonpartisan effort to ensure the accuracy of election results, revealing it was part of a multi-state effort by allies of former President Donald Trump to restore him to office.\n\nLogan\'s messages show the work of hundreds of volunteers − who spent two months in 2021 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum reviewing ballots and recording individual votes onto more than 70,000 tally sheets − couldn\'t even be counted.\n\nHere\'s the latest on Logan, his texts and the review of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County.\n\nWhat was reason behind the Arizona \'audit\'?\n\nSenate Republicans in 2021 announced they would commission a hand count of every ballot cast in Maricopa County to address claims the election had been stolen from Trump. The Senate subpoenaed the ballots and other election material from the county.\n\nSenate President Karen Fann hired the Cyber Ninjas to lead the hand count. Although neither Logan nor his company had election auditing experience, Fann at the time said he was ""well qualified"" and ""well experienced."" The review was supposed to take a few weeks and cost taxpayers $150,000.\n\nIt would take about two months and cost Arizona millions of dollars.\n\nWhat \'findings\' did Cyber Ninjas report to the Senate?\n\nLogan announced the results of the hand count on Sept. 24, 2021. He reported Joe Biden won the presidential election in Arizona. Logan\'s tally differed from the county\'s official results by 994 votes.\n\nLogan\'s report skimmed over Biden\'s win and raised a host of ""anomalies"" that continued to raise doubts about the election process. It left lawmakers, partisan contractors and Trump allies calling for more audits, the rejection of voting machines and new voter integrity laws to prevent fraud at the polls.\n\nFull story:\'Our numbers are screwy\': Cyber Ninjas CEO admits he couldn\'t tally hand count of ballots\n\nDo Logan\'s private texts contradict his public statements?\n\nYes. In hundreds of recently released texts from the summer of 2021, Logan admitted he couldn\'t make sense of his own data. Days after the hand count ended, Logan confirmed he had no way to tally the results.\n\n""How plausible is this solution looking? I looped back to look through all of the aggregation data again. It (is) pretty broken. A lot of it doesn\'t make any sense,"" Logan wrote in a July 5, 2021, text.\n\nDid Logan say, \'Our numbers are screwy?\'\n\nHe did. Even after he turned over his numbers to Arizona Senate Republicans ― 11 days before the Senate hearing ― Logan was trying to reconcile his own data, with no success.\n\n""Reading through that summary doc on President vs. Senate. Looks like basically our numbers are screwy,"" he said in a Sept. 13 text message.\n\nWhat is Logan\'s response to this?\n\nHe has not responded to repeated interview requests from The Arizona Republic. He has declined to answer specific questions about his text messages or his activities.\n\nHow did the Cyber Ninjas fix the numbers problem?\n\nTexts show they didn\'t. For weeks, Logan tried unsuccessfully to tally more than 70,000 sheets where volunteers recorded individual votes with tick marks. He worked with a technology expert named Mike Piehota, but they couldn\'t come up with a computer system to read the marks.\n\n""To cut to the chase, it\'s my opinion we\'re not going to be able to accurately process tally sheets using current text recognition technology,"" Piehota wrote in a July 6 text. ""Ultimately, we need to consider a different approach if you want to revisit tally sheets in the short term. Other than a massive manual effort, I don\'t have a good answer.""\n\nLogan replied minutes later: ""I don\'t care if we have to hand-write in the batch number, etc. As long as the tally is correct most of the time.""\n\nDid Cyber Ninjas make up numbers?\n\nLogan\'s texts show how his team shifted away from trying to quantify the hand count and sought other means to deliver plausible numbers to the Senate.\n\nThey first tried counting votes by scanning tally sheets. They couldn\'t get a software program to read the tick marks. Then they focused on counting the total number of ballots, scouring county electronic tabulation records, creating worksheets and databases and weighing ballot boxes on scales.\n\nThe texts indicate they failed at these efforts.\n\nIs that why the Senate brought in machines to count ballots?\n\nNeither Logan nor the Senate issued any public statements about the inability to quantify the results of the hand count.\n\nThe hand count ended on June 25, 2021. Days later, Fann said Logan\'s hand count of ballots were far off Maricopa County\'s official results. Fann on July 8 said the Senate had purchased two machine counters as a way to ""triple check"" the numbers.\n\nShe did not disclose the number Logan provided.\n\nWas the Arizona \'audit\' part of a larger election scheme?\n\nThe text messages show Logan already was part of a coordinated effort to overturn 2020 election results in several swing states when he was tapped to lead the Arizona Senate\'s partisan ""audit,"" records show.\n\nThousands of text messages to and from Logan show he worked closely with allies of then-President Donald Trump as they plotted to challenge outcomes in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nTexts show that Fann privately communicated with Logan in February 2021, likely on a recommendation from retired Army Col. Phil Waldron, an ardent Trump supporter and election conspiracy theorist. She publicly named Logan as the audit leader on March 31, 2021.\n\nFull story:Arizona \'audit\' leader traded messages with dozens of \'Stop the Steal\' partisans, texts show\n\nWhen did Logan start strategizing with Trump allies?\n\nLess than two weeks after Trump lost the November 2020 election, Logan was invited to pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood\'s plantation properties in South Carolina to map out ways for challenging election results in swing states, texts and court records show.\n\nLogan testified in a Georgia civil elections case last year that he stayed at the plantation for about six weeks, from Nov. 14 until Dec. 24, rubbing shoulders with members of Trump\'s legal team and other loyalists.\n\nWho on Team Trump helped Logan?\n\nThe strategy meetings involved a who\'s who of Trumpworld conspiracy theorists, cyber specialists, lawyers, retired government officials and some Republican state lawmakers.\n\nThe group included Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, former National Security Agency official Jim Penrose, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Former Army Capt. Seth Keshel.\n\nAll later would participate in the Maricopa County ballot review. They helped Logan raise millions for the ""audit,"" helped him write reports and offered logistical support, texts and court records show.\n\nAre authorities investigating Logan?\n\nLogan was involved in multiple breaches of voting equipment in Georgia and Michigan in the weeks leading up to the Arizona ""audit,"" texts and court records show.\n\nIn January 2021, he and others were captured on video surveillance heading into an elections office in Coffee County, Georgia, where authorities said voting equipment was breached. He has not been charged there.\n\nLogan is under investigation by Michigan authorities for illegally accessing and dismantling voting machines in April 2021 as part of a plot to prove the election was rigged. He has not been charged there.\n\nHow did The Republic get Logan\'s text messages?\n\nThe Republic in June 2021 requested emails, text messages and all other communications from Cyber Ninjas and the Senate. When they refused, The Republic filed lawsuits alleging violations of the Arizona Pubic Records Law.\n\nA judge in January 2022 ordered Logan to turn over all records and communications related to the audit and fined his company $50,000 a day until he complied. The fines now total more than $5 million.\n\nIs Logan still withholding records?\n\nYes. Logan has turned over texts in haphazard, nonsequential batches and in different formats, so threads were broken and not easily searchable. The messages, released in November and December 2022 and February and March 2023, were not organized chronologically or in any other discernable order.\n\nAnd while Logan has released more than 39,000 text messages, he has redacted 3,000 more without explanation and in apparent violation of court orders.\n\nHow did you make sense of 39,000 text messages?\n\nAn independent team of nationally recognized data analysts known as The Audit Guys built software to untangle and organize the messages.\n\nThe Audit Guys have long challenged Logan\'s ballot review as ""fiction"" and after an exhaustive analysis of data in 2021 concluded that Logan\'s ""results"" were wildly inaccurate and made up.\n\nAfter consolidating the texts in a searchable database, The Audit Guys determined Logan at one time omitted about 4,000 messages from his side of conversations and duplicated 5,500 in multiple batches. They have identified gaps in messages, blank and redacted texts and references to messaging systems that Logan never turned over.\n\nWho are The Audit Guys?\n\nThe Audit Guys are Larry Moore, the founder of Boston-based election technology company Clear Ballot Group; Benny White, a prominent Pima County Republican data analyst; and Tim Halvorsen, Clear Ballot\'s retired chief technology officer.\n\nTheir stated mission is to ""debunk election disinformation and confront those who use their power to spread it.""\n\nWhy does the hand count matter two years later?\n\nLogan\'s findings allowed Trump allies to insist the vote was compromised. Its immediate aftermath was to further instill distrust in voting machines and encourage partisan calls for paper ballot tabulations, hand recounts and ""audits."" They have also called for an end to early voting.\n\nWith the 2024 election around the corner, many partisan actors claim without evidence that machine tabulated ballots are rife with fraud. And they insist the only way to prevent fraud is through a hand count of ballots.\n\nLook no farther than Cochise County, where Republican officials in 2022 sought to delay certification of the election until after commissioning a full hand count, which was blocked by the courts.\n\nA judge in April fined two Cochise County supervisors $37,000 in legal and court fees for failing to follow state elections procedures.\n\nHow much has the Arizona \'audit\' cost taxpayers?\n\nTaxpayer costs are about $5 million so far. That includes $518,000 Maricopa County spent in its fight with Senate Republicans over access to its voting equipment and related records and $3.2 million for new voting machines. The Senate has spent at least $1.1 million, of which about half has been spent on legal fees.\n\nIn addition to the public costs, Cyber Ninjas received at least $6.7 million from private donors. The firm last year said it had lost at least $2 million, according to a financial statement shared with the Senate.\n\nCyber Ninjas has since gone out of business'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.courthousenews.com/arizona-supreme-court-to-determine-if-the-public-has-a-right-to-access-cyber-ninja-related-audit-records/', 'Headline': 'Arizona justices to decide if public has right to see Cyber Ninja ...', 'Snippet': 'The audit is recounting voter ballots and retesting ballot tabulation machines.” Kory Langhofer, an attorney for Fann and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Warren Petersen, argued that the Legislature has broad powers and a duty to safeguard elections.

Courtney Pedroza/Getty Images. A contractor ...', 'Full_text': 'Since the 2020 election, Donald Trump and his allies have produced no evidence that Joe Biden’s victory was illegitimate despite their dozens of failed lawsuits, shrill propaganda, and bad-faith postelection reviews. But Trump’s party has shown no reluctance to revise the rules of voting to advantage Republicans before 2022’s midterms and 2024’s presidential election.\n\nLed by battleground state legislators, the Trumpers have rewritten voting laws, threatened election administrators, begun purges of county election boards, created new gerrymanders, and more. The worst of these power grabs limit access to a ballot, which is the starting line of voting, for anti-Trump blocs and would disqualify ballots and nullify votes before the finish line.\n\nThis playbook is not new. But modern voting systems, from voter registration to tallying paper ballots, contain numerous stages and respective data sets, many of which are public records and are quite detailed. If smartly used after Election Day, these records could provide an easily understood evidence trail that would make it much harder for the Trump faction to proclaim victory prematurely or falsely.\n\nThere are formidable obstacles, though—not just to accessing and parsing the data but to getting election professionals and opinion leaders on board. In recent years, their top priority has been countering cybersecurity threats from abroad, not countering domestic disinformation so that average voters, not election insiders, can see and trust what lies behind high-stakes results.\n\nUsing public election records to debunk stolen election lies and confront propagandists is not a “fool’s game,” as a New York Times editorial board member recently opined—arguing that “the professional vote-fraud crusaders are not in the fact business.” The template of debunking and confronting election-theft lies is the largely untold story of what happened in Arizona in 2021, where Trumpers ultimately were forced to admit that Biden won, a process\n\nI witnessed.\n\nTrump’s agents were plotting to fabricate a favorable vote count. But they were stymied by their vast inexperience in elections. As important, they were boxed in at key junctures by three retired election technologists who used public records to hold them accountable. The trio warned the pro-Trump contractors and their legislative sponsors that their “audit” was being watched, repeatedly reported why it was a propaganda-filled hoax, and gradually won local and national press coverage.\n\nMost strikingly, it was the technologists—not Arizona’s Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, nor Democratic Party lawyers, experts in policy circles and academia, or journalists—who showed that tens of thousands of loyal Republican voters from Phoenix’s suburbs did not vote for Trump. That pattern alone, based on hard data, confirmed his loss in Arizona.\n\nThe retirees did more. They rebutted the lie from Trump’s noisemakers that tens of thousands of dead people and made-up people voted, by pairing every ballot cast with a legal voter. They showed that there was no collusion to alter vote counts when local election officials reviewed sloppily marked ballots to determine a voter’s intent, again using public data that tracked the officials’ actions.\n\nAnd months after Arizona Senate Republicans hired the Cyber Ninjas, a data security firm led by a Trump cultist with no experience in elections, to oversee its 2020 election review in Maricopa County (greater Phoenix), the retirees boxed the Ninjas into revealing that they could not accurately recount votes—again using public records. That strategy culminated last September, when Cyber Ninja CEO Doug Logan testified that Biden had won Arizona, after all.\n\n“We seriously doubt anyone involved in initiating or supporting this activity ever imagined that three retired citizens with knowledge of elections, election law, administration and procedures, election system design and operation, and data analysis skills could hold [Cyber Ninjas] to account and demonstrate convincingly that their announced results were meaningless,” said Benny White, a retired pilot with a law degree and longtime Arizona Republican (yes, Republican!) Party data analyst. “They also never anticipated that their entire effort could be dismantled by referring to available public records and without spending a penny.”\n\nDuring an October webcast by an MIT-based election science working group, Larry Moore, the founder and former CEO of Clear Ballot Group, a federally certified election auditing firm, a Democrat, and the second member of the trio, said, “Benny and I have talked many times about, if we knew back in November [2020] what we know now, and we had that information that Trump lost because Republicans voted against him, [whether] that could have changed the [Big Lie’s] narrative, or slowed the narrative down.”\n\nMoore continued: “Right now, as Bob Anglen, who is the writer of the Arizona Republic’s piece [on their analysis that the Ninjas miscounted more than 300,000 ballots], said, ‘You know what we’re not hearing? We’re hearing nothing from the right against your findings. They are that solid.’ I think by analyzing this hard data, and coupling it with ballot-image analysis, we have a shot at very quickly debunking with real hard evidence these allegations that will inevitably be made.”\n\nThe trio’s third member was Tim Halvorsen, Clear Ballot’s former chief technology officer and an independent.\n\nHow “the Audit Guys” Got Started\n\nLast winter, as pro-Trump state legislators began clamoring for “forensic audits”—a made-up term that has no relation to any established election audit—White, Moore, and Halvorsen, who came to call themselves “the Audit Guys,” decided to direct their experience toward a simple goal: to use public election records, which are the building blocks of voter lists and vote counts, to refute the stolen-election clichés and lies.\n\nThe effort began in Arizona’s Pima County, home to Tucson, where White lives and had just lost the race for county recorder, the official who oversees its elections. For more than a decade, White had been tracking voter turnout for the Arizona Republican Party. He turned to two data sets: the county’s voter registration file and another county-generated list of everyone who voted. He wanted to see what had happened in his race and other contests, and to ensure that all voters were legal.\n\nIronically, White, who proudly describes himself as a Republican “data analyst,” knew exactly how to investigate the voter fraud accusations, which have been a GOP talking point for decades and used to fan ill will in elections where Republican candidates have lost. In late November 2020, White knew that Trump was lying about voter fraud in Arizona.\n\nAbout two weeks after Election Day, Pima County released its canvass report—the official election results, including precinct-by-precinct subtotals in every contest. White used the records to map 2020’s voter turnout and saw a pattern: Republican voters were rejecting Trump. “I first started seeing this phenomenon of areas where Biden had won the precinct but there were more Republicans than Democrats in the precinct,” he recalled. “Then I did the same thing for Maricopa County [greater Phoenix]. This was all in mid-to-late November.”\n\nWhite also looked at historic voter-turnout data. This wasn’t data that revealed voting patterns on individual ballots, which the Audit Guys got to later. White was looking for improbable voter turnout at the precinct level. He did not see anything abnormal as he parsed the precinct-level results, county voter registration files, and individual voter histories. White, of course, heard Trump’s overheated claims of illegal voting. Republicans he knew were reciting them.\n\n“Being in the position that I have been in for a number of years [as a GOP data analyst], I am continually bombarded with these various conspiracies. And they don’t have much effect on me in any particular instance,” White recalled. “In this particular case, the narcissist tendencies of Donald Trump started coming to the fore. The [campaign’s postelection] lawsuits were getting filed, and I was watching the lawsuits and the court decisions throughout this whole period of time, up until March. People were making a lot of claims, but they were not substantiated. And here in Arizona, I was confident that we didn’t have the problems that were being claimed, and I was telling my party leadership the same thing. Now my party leadership, as it turns out, was not listening to me. But I was telling everybody that would listen what I was finding.”\n\nWhite’s use of voter registration files and records of who had voted in November eventually became one evidence trail that the Audit Guys cited to refute claims of massive illegal voting. Basically, he paired every ballot cast with a legally registered voter. The exceptions were the handful of police, judges, and domestic abuse victims whose identities are kept confidential. This was how White showed that virtually all presidential election ballots were cast by legal voters.\n\nWhat was notable about this line of inquiry was that it produced more easily understood evidence and explanations than the technicality-laced assurances by election officials that their voting systems were reliable. Moreover, the Audit Guys’ takeaways were based on public records.\n\nThough White was delving into the arcane nuts and bolts of election procedure and data, his focus was not on defending that process, per se, as Arizona election officials did. Rather, he was carefully using hard data as the basis for clear explanations that appealed to common sense; explanations that he hoped would stand a better chance of being trusted by voters. “The secret to all of that is knowing what you want to get out of the data,” White said.\n\nAs Arizona emerged as the epicenter of post-2020 reviews, White wanted to examine another public record: the much more detailed countywide database of every vote cast on every ballot. Unlike the county canvass report’s subtotals of precinct-level results, this larger database would allow him to detect voting patterns on individual ballots.\n\n“I was able to look at it [the canvass] on a win-loss basis in a precinct, but I was not able to identify this ballot as a Republican voter or a Democrat because I can’t tie a ballot to a voter registration record,” he explained. “But when I looked at [each ballot to see] if they’re voting for Republican candidates, you can say they’re Republican-supportive voters independent of what political party they’re aligned with.”\n\nIn other words, this data set would find otherwise loyal Republicans who rejected Trump. “We got started in early March,” Moore recounted during the MIT webcast. “Benny gave me a call and said, ‘You want to have some fun with this [cast-vote record] and trying to debunk disinformation?’ And I said, ‘Absolutely,’ and then it turned out that CVR was really a monster data file. And I brought in my former CTO [Tim Halvorsen], who really knows his stuff in this area. And we whipped that into shape in about a week.”\n\nIn Maricopa County, the voting system can produce a database report that contains every vote on every ballot, which is what Moore is referring to. However, this overall report is not initially in a format that average voters can open and read on their laptops.\n\nMaricopa County residents cast 2.1 million ballots in fall 2020. It is the nation’s second-largest election jurisdiction after Los Angeles County. Its cast-vote record was organized into ballot inventory files (called the manifest) and 10,341 batches (each containing about 200 ballots). Halvorsen, in a process familiar to computer scientists, converted the data (in JSON format) to a mySQL database. “When it is fully up on mySQL, it’s running right around 40 gigabytes,” Moore said. “Think of it as 2.1 million rows and about 800 columns and lots of indices [how votes were tallied].”\n\nMoore reminded the MIT audience that the cast-vote record could reveal if voters had split their votes between different parties’ candidates. “The cast-vote record, for those of you familiar with it, is the only election artifact coming out of the voting system that tells you how people didn’t vote. And that turns out to be key,” he said. “We wanted to find out who voted for these down-ballot [Republican] candidates but didn’t vote for Trump. And, by the way, which of those did vote for Biden.”\n\nThe Audit Guys knew what to look for and began sorting and sifting through the data. “We created out of the cast-vote record—I think this will be very familiar to political scientists—a synthetic variable called ‘disaffected Republican supportive voters,’ which is simply defined as those voters who voted for a majority of down-ballot Republican candidates,” Moore said. “And in Maricopa, there were 15 candidates … and they voted for eight or more of those. But they didn’t vote for Trump.”\n\nMoore and Halvorsen quickly found tens of thousands of Republicans who had rejected Trump. White then identified where those voters lived, using precinct-mapping software. “In Maricopa County, there were 59,800 of these folks that were evenly spread out through the mapping data,” Moore said. “And there were 39,102 of the 59,800 who voted for Biden.… And that number, to put it in context, the 39,102, is 3.7 times the winning margin [10,457 votes] that Biden had statewide.”\n\n“Let that sink in,” Moore continued. “Republicans, heavily Republican-leaning voters, voted against Trump at what turned out to be an overwhelming margin. That’s one of the reasons why he lost. There’s a lot of reasons why they did that. But this is just the raw data, brought to life, in such a way that political scientists can now say, with much more definitiveness, ‘Where were these guys [voters] located? What were their average median incomes?’ etc.”\n\nMaricopa County is no different from any other election jurisdiction in that this database of all votes cast on each ballot is the basis for what officials call the canvass—or the certified results. The deadline for finalizing election results varies among states. In Arizona, the canvass must be done within 20 days of an election, meaning the database the Audit Guys analyzed in March 2021 could have been used in November 2020 to show that greater Phoenix’s Republicans had rejected Trump in sufficient numbers to cost him the election.\n\nIn November 2020, White saw the pattern of loyal Republicans rejecting Trump and voting for Biden. But it was not until March 2021 that he, assisted by Moore and Halvorsen, had the cast-vote record and ran the analytics that confirmed the voting patterns behind Trump’s loss. As Moore said when concluding his talk, imagine if the press, political parties, and public had seen this evidence trail and disaffected Republicans had been interviewed in mid-November.\n\nNo Machine Errors, No Staff Collusion, No Dead Voters\n\nInstead, the absence of easily understood explanations was filled by yet more election-theft conspiracies impugning election officials. The Trumpers were claiming that local officials had siphoned away votes. The Audit Guys also used the cast-vote record to refute that attack.\n\nThat accusation typifies a frequent tactic among 2020’s election deniers: finding and hyping an irrelevant statistic as the basis for a conspiracy theory. Maricopa County’s 2020 fall ballots had numerous contests on them—from the presidency to local offices. The Trumpers, correctly, noted that 235,000 ballots had sloppily marked ovals that had been examined by officials to determine the voter’s intent in that race. That review process is called adjudication.\n\nThe Trumpers cited the volume of adjudicated votes to claim that the election results could not be trusted. They further said that the adjudication process hid massive ballot-box stuffing.\n\nIt turns out that Maricopa County’s voting system, made by Dominion, is very precise and accurate, and the adjudication records affirmed that. If the cast-vote record is the finish line of counting votes, the starting line begins with the marking of a paper ballot and the tabulation system’s initial assignment of votes. This process involves another detailed data set.\n\nAfter a voter marks a paper ballot with a pen, it goes through a scanner that reads the ballot. The scanner creates a digital image of each side of every ballot card. Software then detects the ballot style, which is all of the races on that voter’s ballot. The software then correlates filled-in ovals with the candidates and questions. If an oval is sloppily marked—say it is not filled in or an ‘X’ is there—or if a voter has voted more than once in a contest, Dominion’s system sets aside that ballot for adjudication. That means county election staff must electronically review the ballot image to determine the voter’s intent. The cast-vote record includes notes on why every adjudicated ballot was flagged and how that voter’s intent was resolved.\n\n“Trump alleged that the [county] staff split the vote to Biden,” Moore said. “In reality, there were 235,000 votes that had to be adjudicated, but only 11,900 were in the presidential race. And 68 percent of those were adjudicating write-ins [for candidates not on the ballot]. So when you break it down and explain it, it is perfectly plausible why this happened. And by the way, Biden eked out a mere 533-vote difference between he and Trump [among the adjudicated ballots]. This was a nothing burger.”\n\nThe cast-vote record offered more proof that this line of attack was another lie. It had no inordinate volume of ballots with only Biden votes. The Audit Guys saw that there were only 3,024 ballots with one vote on it for Biden and another 3,474 ballots with only one vote on it for Trump. Their August report noted that there were still other ballot inventory records—again, public documents—such as the number of requests for mailed-out ballots and number of returned ballots, which would have surfaced any illegality. “One cannot simply dump extra ballots into the system; they are too easily detected,” their report said.\n\nA Template for 2022 and 2024\n\nOne might ask, why aren’t election officials—or others who work in campaigns and elections—using public records to offer quick and readily understood explanations in high-stakes races?\n\nThe answer is layered. Some officials are partisans, whether elected or appointed, and do not see a need for greater transparency—especially if their side wins. Among civil servants, there is an ethic of not wanting to take sides, and often an aversion to having outsiders peer over their shoulders. That’s because elections will almost always be beset by small human or technical errors, which partisans or critics tend to blow out of proportion.\n\nAs a result, election officials often cite technical protocols that attest to their voting system’s reliability, which is akin to “Trust us. We’re experts.” Those protocols may be accurate, but most do not track legal voters, ballot inventories, and every vote. Thus, election professionals have not swayed average voters, as the numerous polls showing that majorities of Republicans believe Trump and his enablers attest. Officials also are busy after Election Day, and many do not welcome the added work of producing and presenting public data sets. Further, some officials argue that key data sets, such as digital ballot images, are not public records.\n\nHovering above these reasons is a larger hurdle. Providing the public with easily understood evidence to trust election results has not been a priority of election insiders. The profession has been more focused on cybersecurity since 2016—in response to Russian meddling—than on countering domestic disinformation coming from a former president and his party. Officials know that disinformation is undermining their work and public confidence in American democracy. But the latest advice given in government journals, policy think tanks, and academic research omits using public data in a focused way to debunk and confront election-theft narratives.\n\nA handful of states and counties are exceptions. Maryland double-checks all of its preliminary results—every vote in every race—before certifying winners. It counts the votes recorded on the digital image of every paper ballot card, which is the first electronic file that is created by vote-count scanners after a voter has turned in their ballot. Florida, a Republican-run state, is now finalizing rules to use digital ballot images in recounts. (The images would be created by a second scan of every paper ballot by an independent system.) That process could become pivotal if its 2022 midterms and 2024 presidential race are close.\n\nAs a way to build trust in elections, both states are using a visual technology, invented by Audit Guy Moore, that lets nontechnical people “see” voters’ intent. In short, a viewable library of the most sloppily marked ballots in every race is created, which lets candidates and voters see the most questionable ballots and, if needed, retrieve them for examination. In Florida, where this technology was piloted, its reputation rose among election officials after disproving voter fraud allegations in a county sheriff’s race where the losing candidate had sued. Of course, in a presidential race, the right-wing media would dispute such results and feature “experts” making much ado about irrelevant or false matters. But I have seen this process convince Democratic and Republican candidates to accept results and not to file for recounts.\n\nBut it may be that election officials are not best suited for convincing the public that election results can be trusted. That task, the Audit Guys’ White believes, belongs with the political parties, campaign consultants, and academia. Election officials, in contrast, simply need to provide the public records promptly and in uniform data formats. Again, any such process will still be savagely contentious, particularly if Trump is the 2024 GOP nominee and is behind. But at least the competing factions would be working from the same records and data sets—unlike 2021’s Trumpers, who sought to fabricate vote-count evidence and hyped irrelevant data.\n\n“I don’t put the responsibility to do all that stuff on election officials,” White said. “They need to defend their work. That’s obvious. But there are other entities that are better suited to do the analysis: either political parties, or campaign consultants, or even university political science people. They ought to be able to dig into this stuff and teach their students how to do it.”\n\nWhite raises an intriguing point. The voter-centric data that he uses is already used by political parties and campaign consultants to turn out voters; it’s just not used to debunk voter fraud claims. Moreover, computer scientists say there is nothing especially difficult about parsing election data, although one has to know what one is looking for and be patient and careful.\n\n“There are lots of details to be careful about. But it’s not rocket science,” said Duncan Buell, who recently retired from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of South Carolina. Buell was a county election official and has spent years parsing election data in his state, as well as Pennsylvania, Kansas, North Carolina, and Texas. “It’s a little tedious, like keeping track of all one’s charitable contributions for tax purposes, but it’s not intellectually much more difficult than that. One sums the rows in a spreadsheet, and the columns in a spreadsheet, and verifies that the number in the bottom right-hand corner comes out the same both ways.”\n\nBuell said working with cast-vote record files involved writing and testing scripts for small searches before querying the entire database. “It’s necessary to be careful developing code using small data subsets, and one has to be careful with the big data set, because it’s not possible to know what is really in the data,” he said in an email. “We test, and test, and test again, and we always accept a certain level of skepticism about whether we might have made mistakes and have to refine our analysis yet further.”\n\nBut Buell agreed with White that third-party involvement was important for voter confidence. He cited Carolyn Crnich, who ran elections in Humboldt County, California, saying, “I don’t like saying to my constituents, ‘Hey, just trust me.’” Buell believed that his analyses have helped boost public confidence and similar analyses can help throughout the country.\n\n“It’s not that the election officials can’t be trusted,” he said. “I know lots of election officials, and I was one for two years before moving out of South Carolina, but it helps that an outside entity can reproduce the results.”\n\nIn early January, Maricopa County, which is run by moderate Republicans, issued its final report debunking dozens of accusations by the state Senate’s pro-Trump contractors. While the report was dismissed by the Arizona GOP chairwoman and ignored by the Senate president, it built on the Audit Guys’ strategy of using public records to debunk and confront 2020’s propagandists. In other words, at a time when many analysts are warning that battleground states are heading toward partisan civil war, the Audit Guys have created a template that may help save our democracy. And at least in Arizona, some responsible Republicans are paying attention.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/elections/correcting-the-record-maricopa-county-blasts-senate-gops-election-review-in-point-by-point-takedown-heres-what-we-know/75-747c9bfe-eaea-41f5-9290-0763510ddbb9', 'Headline': 'Arizona audit; Maricopa County blasts Senate GOP election review ...', 'Snippet': 'PHOENIX — In a point-by-point rebuke titled “Correcting the Record,” the Maricopa County Elections Department on Wednesday rejected every one of 76 claims made by Arizona Senate Republicans ...', 'Full_text': 'PHOENIX — In a point-by-point rebuke titled “Correcting the Record,” the Maricopa County Elections Department on Wednesday rejected every one of 76 claims made by Arizona Senate Republicans’ review of the 2020 election results.\n\n“Despite all evidence to the contrary, false allegations continue to persist and damage voter confidence,” according to the report.\n\n“Nearly every finding included faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions, and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws.”\n\nHere\'s what we know about the new report:\n\nResponse to Senate\'s September report\n\nThe county’s 93-page report is a response to the Arizona Senate GOP report issued in September, as well as to claims made by the Senate’s contractors when they presented their work.\n\nThe county report was provided to 12 News ahead of its release at a Maricopa County Board meeting Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe board oversees elections in the country’s second-largest voting jurisdiction.

Rand Paul was an opportunity for the GOP to, in a moment echoing one of the McCarthy era’s most notorious hearings ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s foremost experts on infectious diseases, has at long last reached the end of his rope. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was hectoring him in a congressional hearing, when he said, “You are the lead architect responsible from the government, and now 800,000 people have died.”\n\nAs Fauci began his response, stressing masks and vaccines for the umpteenth time, Paul interrupted, “and you have advocated to make it coercive and done by force, and you’ve advocated it be done by mandate.”\n\nRising to high moral dudgeon, Paul resorted to sarcasm: “You have advocated that your infallible opinion be dictated by law.”\n\nFauci had had enough. He put Paul’s attacks into context – and the context is dark.\n\n“I have threats upon my life,” he said. “Harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.” Fauci then got into specifics, and they are chilling: “Just about three or four weeks ago, on December 21, a person was arrested who was on their way from Sacramento to Washington, DC at a speed stop in Iowa. And the police asked him where he was going. And he was going to Washington, DC to kill Dr. Fauci. And they found in his car an AR-15 and multiple magazines of ammunition, because he thinks that maybe I’m killing people.”\n\nNow we know the threat of physical violence is real. The Capitol itself was the scene of a violent and vicious attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot and grievously wounded by a gunman in 2017, and Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head at point blank range in 2011 by a man who murdered a federal judge and five others in the attack.\n\nBut Fauci took it one step further on Wednesday, offering a theory behind Paul’s attacks. He displayed screen shots he said were from one of Paul’s political websites, seeking to raise campaign donations from his attacks on Fauci.\n\nHaving been through more political song and dance than I care to recall, I think I can spot insincerity. Fauci’s response, I believe, was real. It was raw. And it was righteous.\n\nFauci is not infallible, but he is a dedicated public servant who has spent his long career trying to protect Americans from illness and death. He deserves tough questions, to be sure, and even criticism where warranted. But at a time when national security officials warn that, “We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists,” Paul seems to have crossed a line.\n\nThe fact the Rand Paul for Senate committee is raising money on a website called firefauci.org suggests that politics, rather than public health, might be part of the motivation of the junior senator from Kentucky.\n\nThe Senate has always had demagogues, liars and outliers who go too far. Fauci’s measured but heartfelt takedown should have been a Joseph Welch moment. Welch was the lawyer for the US Army when the notorious Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin was spreading hysterical chargers that communists had infiltrated the army, along with the State Department, Treasury and even the White House.\n\nWhen McCarthy impugned a young lawyer from Welch’s firm, the soft-spoken, bespectacled Welch could take it no more. “Until this moment, senator,” he said, “I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” McCarthy was stunned into silence, as Welch continued, “Have you no sense of decency?”\n\nWelch’s response broke the fever. Six months later, McCarthy was formally censured by his Senate colleagues 67-22. Half of the Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn their fellow Republican.\n\nNot now. Paul’s rant against Fauci produced a strong and immediate condemnation from Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “Thank you, first of all, for what you do,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to put your life at risk…. And thank you for calling out this agenda for what it is: an attempt to score political points, to build a political power base around the denial of science and around personal attacks on you and your family.”\n\nBut where was the GOP condemnation of Paul? Nearly nonexistent.\n\nTo his credit, though, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah defended Fauci. “Some of what we do [in these hearings] is performing,” he said, in an apparent reference to Paul’s attack. “And some of what we do is to become informed.”\n\nHe went on to stress his appreciation for Fauci and the other scientists who were testifying. “I do want to point out how much I personally, and I believe the great majority of the people of our country respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do. You are scientists, not politicians. Nevertheless, you are being made subject to the political whims of various political individuals, and that comes at a high cost.”\n\nTwo cheers for Romney for defending Fauci and for labeling the attacks on him as political. But I do wish he had followed through and condemned his GOP colleague the way Republicans condemned McCarthy decades ago. Perhaps that’s too much to ask in these hyper-partisan times.\n\nPerhaps Romney has assessed that condemning Paul might have opposite effect of the censure of McCarthy; that if he were to condemn Paul the result would be a diminution of Romney’s political strength within the Trumpified GOP, while strengthening Paul even more.\n\nThat is a depressing thought, but likely accurate. So long as there is money to be raised, clicks to be earned, votes to be gained, we can expect power-hungry politicians to, well, be reckless and dangerous – even during a deadly pandemic.

Rand Paul and Roger Marshall came in a hearing on the federal response to the Omicron variant of Covid-19 as the Biden administration faces growing scrutiny alongside record hospitalizations, testing challenges and messaging frustration – issues the GOP has seized on.\n\nEarly in the hearing, after Paul sought to cast Fauci as a “dangerous” government official, the White House chief medical adviser and top infectious disease expert said such rhetoric “kindles the crazies” and has led to threats against his family.\n\n“What happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue is that all of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there and I have life – threats upon my life – harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me,” Fauci said before suggesting the Kentucky Republican was attacking him as a way of raising money.\n\n“So I asked myself, ‘Why would Senator want to do this?’ So, go to Rand Paul website. And you see, ‘Fire Dr. Fauci’ with a little box that says, ‘contribute here,’ you can do $5, $10, $20, $100,” he said. “So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.”\n\nFauci brought a similarly pointed tone to his exchange with Marshall after the Kansas Republican falsely accused him of withholding financial disclosure forms.\n\n“You’re so misinformed, it’s extraordinary,” a visibly frustrated Fauci told Marshall, calling his financial information “public knowledge” for nearly four decades. After the back-and-forth, Fauci could be heard saying, “What a moron. Jesus Christ.”\n\nSpeaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360” Tuesday evening, Fauci said public health officials “should be having to respond to tough questions.”\n\n“And yet, the only thing that came out of Sen. Rand Paul and, to some extent, Sen. Roger Marshall, were ad hominems, which does nothing but distract from what we really need to be doing,” he said.\n\nIn response to the hearing, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN in a statement Tuesday that Republicans on the panel “clearly weren’t trying to stop the spread” of misinformation.\n\n“At a time when America is seeing rising COVID cases, it’s disappointing and frankly unacceptable that Republican Senators chose to spend a hearing with the country’s leading public health experts spreading conspiracy theories and lies about Dr. Fauci, rather than how we protect people from COVID-19,” spokesman Ian Sams said.\n\n“The Biden Administration will continue to focus on getting more Americans vaccinated and boosted and helping Americans get access to the tools to keep themselves and others safe. We would encourage these Republicans to join us.”\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s about three times last winter’s peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to Johns Hopkins.\n\n“Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody,” Fauci told J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, on Tuesday.\n\n“Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/anthony-fauci-rand-paul-covid-fundraising-1282682/', 'Headline': 'Fauci Exposes Rand Paul for Fundraising off Covid Lies - Rolling Stone', 'Snippet': 'Dr. Anthony Fauci called Sen.

Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) a “moron” during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. “Jesus Christ,” Fauci added.\n\nThe comments came after a heated exchanged in which Marshall blasted Fauci for concealing his financial disclosure, which is supposed to be public. The only issue, as Fauci pointed out, is that his financial disclosure is public. “You are totally incorrect,” said a flabbergasted Fauci.\n\nMarshall went after Fauci hard on Tuesday, but no lawmaker has attacked him as consistently and ardently as Rand Paul. The anti-vax senator from Kentucky has not only bashed the nation’s top infectious disease expert as an egomaniacal tyrant destroying America, but as someone who is responsible for the disease existing in the first place. Fauci during the hearing shed some light on why Paul might be spreading lies about him.\n\n“Why would a senator want to do this?” Fauci said. “Go to Rand Paul’s website, and you see ‘Fire Dr. Fauci’ with a little box that says contribute here. You can do $5, $10, $20, $100. So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.”\n\nHere’s the full exchange:\n\nFauci exposing one of Paul’s motivations — if not his only motivation — in attacking him came during a heated exchange between the senator and the scientist. Such exchanges are now customary whenever Fauci appears before the Senate. He was particularly exasperated as ever on Tuesday given how Omicron is causing case rates to skyrocket. “We are here at a committee to look a virus now that has killed nearly 900,000 people,” Fauci said. “And the purpose of the committee was to try to get things out, how we can help the American public. And you keep coming back to personal attacks on me.”\n\nFauci eventually dropped the hammer, explaining that the harassment of his family and death threats against himself before recounting how a man who was arrested last month in Iowa was on his way from California to Washington, D.C., to kill Fauci and others. He wondered why a senator would tell lies to inspire such animosity against someone who is basically just sharing the Centers for Disease Control’s guidance on social distancing, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated. The reason is because Paul thinks it’s good for him politically, and there’s no clearer proof than the billing his #FireFauci campaign gets on his website next to all those donation buttons.\n\nPaul has been one of the Republican Party’s most prolific superspreaders of Covid misinformation in addition to attacking Fauci. YouTube has removed several of Paul’s Covid videos for violating their policy on Covid misinformation, prompting Paul to announce earlier this year that he’s leaving the platform. A few days later, he essentially endorsed the Omicron, describing the variant as “nature’s vaccine” during an appearance on Fox News.\n\nAs Paul was badgering Fauci on Tuesday, the United States broke the record for people hospitalized with Covid.

For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners. But he has also conceded that much about how the virus came to be remains unknown.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.science.org/content/article/why-the-us-has-banned-funding-for-chinese-lab-at-center-of-pandemic-origin-dispute', 'Headline': 'Explainer: Why the U.S. has banned funding for Chinese lab at ... - AAAS', 'Snippet': 'HHS disputes the details, saying that “experts at the NIH” believe the year 5 report “likely” describes a different experiment than the one in the year 4 report.

Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/us-government-bans-wuhan-lab-from-federal-funding/4017756.article', 'Headline': 'US government bans Wuhan lab from federal funding', 'Snippet': '1 Comment.

This latest development exacerbates the drama surrounding the US government’s support of coronavirus research in China prior to the outbreak.\n\nThe WIV research in question, originally awarded funding by the NIH in 2014 and renewed in 2019, was channelled through the New York-based non-profit EcoHealth Alliance. EcoHealth received approximately $600,000 (£467,000) for the project, which involved studying coronaviruses in bats and their potential to jump into humans. The project, which was cancelled in April 2020, was originally funded by the Obama administration. It had come under public attack from Republican politicians in the weeks preceding its termination.\n\nHHS does not argue that the project caused the Covid-19 outbreak, but it does criticise WIV for refusing to share certain information relating to its research.\n\nThe HHS memo, recently released by an oversight committee of the US House of Representatives, noted that the NIH determined in an August 2021 review that the WIV research may have yielded an increase in viral activity that violated the terms of the NIH grant. There was no evidence that EcoHealth had notified the NIH about this possibility as it was required to do, according to HHS.\n\n‘NIH has given WIV several opportunities to disprove this finding, but WIV has failed to do so,’ HHS stated. ‘Due to WIV’s disregard of the NIH’s requests … the NIH’s conclusion that WIV research likely violated protocols of the NIH regarding biosafety is undisputed.’\n\nEcoHealth contends that any increase in viral activity was ‘not statistically significant’, and argues that it had reported the results of its experiments in line with NIH’s requirements.\n\nIn a statement to Chemistry World, EcoHealth says that: ‘The [HHS] claim that there was no evidence that EHA notified NIH about the experiment in question is not correct. EcoHealth Alliance provided the Government Accountability Office with documentation regarding this alleged late reporting that showed the experimental results were first reported in the Year 4 report, which was submitted into the NIH system on time in April 2018, with a copy emailed to the NIAID Program Officer at that time.’\n\nEcoHealth had described the goal of the NIH-funded project as constructing Mers and Mers-like chimeric coronaviruses in order to understand the potential origins of Mers in bats.\n\nWhen NIH abruptly terminated the WIV research in 2020, there was worry that political pressure had motivated the decision. At the time, 77 US Nobel laureates and more than 30 scientific societies including the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology expressed concerns about the decision. The NIH reinstated a diminished version of the grant earlier this year, which no longer includes the involvement of WIV.\n\nThis story was updated on 26 July to include comments from EcoHealth Alliance.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-suspends-federal-funding-wuhan-lab-over-non-compliance-2023-07-19/', 'Headline': 'US suspends federal funding to Wuhan lab over non-compliance', 'Snippet': 'WIV has not received federal funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. medical research agency, since July 2020, according to an HHS statement on Wednesday.', 'Full_text': ''}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106119', 'Headline': 'Federal Research: NIH Could Take Additional Actions to Manage Risks ...', 'Snippet': 'Specifically, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided $200,000 in grant funding to Wuhan University, the only selected Chinese entity to receive funding directly from a federal agency.

To address this recommendation, NIH noted it may need additional authorities and plans to explore government-wide practices, which will take time. However, federal internal controls require that agencies take timely corrective actions to address risks. While NIH pursues long-term actions for award recipients, it has not conducted its own near-term assessments, which could enhance its internal oversight.\n\nWhy GAO Did This Study\n\nFederal agencies sometimes provide funds to foreign entities, such as universities and laboratories, for research or other purposes. Such collaborations can benefit agency missions and lead to advancements in areas such as public health. At the same time, Congress, the White House, and others have expressed concerns about entities from countries, such as China, exploiting U.S. funded research in ways that could harm U.S. national security or economic competitiveness.\n\nGAO was asked to provide information on federal funds disbursed to three selected Chinese entities—Wuhan University; the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.\n\nThis report examines, among other things, the amount of federal funding GAO identified that was provided to the three selected Chinese entities in calendar years 2014 through 2021 and steps agencies and award recipients have taken to assess risks.\n\nGAO searched USAspending.gov and other federal databases and reviewed award agreements, progress reports, payment information, and other documents from federal agencies and U.S.-based award recipients.

The data on COVID-19 hospitalizations are collected by COVID-NET, a surveillance system that collects data on hospitalizations of children and adults with a confirmed infection through a network of over 250 hospitals in 14 states.\n\nThe data are used by the agency to better understand how well the vaccines are working against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nAccording to this data, for example, unvaccinated people over 5 years old were 2.4 times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 and 9 times more likely to die from COVID-19 in January. And in February, unvaccinated adults ages 18 and older were 5 times more likely to have a COVID-19-associated hospitalization than fully vaccinated adults.\n\nThe COVID-19 case and death rate data by vaccination status were last updated on March 17, and cover April 2021 to Feb. 19 for cases and through Jan. 29 for deaths.

He said “we don’t know” how the COVID-19 vaccines are working in the U.S. “because the CDC is no longer releasing their data comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated cases, hospitalizations and deaths.” A Facebook post with the video, uploaded to the show’s page on March 30, has more than 37,000 views.\n\n“A spokesperson for the CDC told the New York Times a few weeks ago, the reason that they are not releasing the data anymore, that we’ve seen throughout the pandemic, is they have worries it’s not ready for prime time because it might increase vaccine hesitancy.

Two key ..."", 'Full_text': 'What went wrong?\n\nAt year\'s end, that\'s the question being asked about the global effort to make sure that all countries get vaccines against COVID-19.\n\nAlmost as soon as the pandemic began, the world\'s leading health organizations joined forces to ensure an ample supply of the vaccines for all nations regardless of income level. The program they created is known as COVAX – short for the COVID-19 Global Access Facility. It was supposed to pre-purchase doses from the manufacturers while the vaccines were still being developed, and then – once the doses became available – distribute them to countries according to their need and charge according to their ability to pay, with the lowest income countries getting the doses for free.\n\nYet as 2021 comes to a close, and the omicron variant spreads across the globe, the vast majority of people in lower income countries remain unvaccinated.\n\nNPR spoke with two public health leaders with unique perspectives on this issue.\n\nSeth Berkley is head of GAVI the Vaccine Alliance — one of the organizations that formed COVAX (along with the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations or CEPI.) Krishna Udayakumar directs Duke University\'s Global Health Innovation Center – which helped create an independent hub for tracking both the progress and the obstacles to COVID vaccine access.\n\nHere are eight takeaways:\n\nThe world is way behind on vaccination targets\n\nIn September President Joe Biden proposed a global goal of vaccinating at least 70% of the world\'s population by autumn of 2022. The United Nations and the World Health Organization argued the target should be met even sooner – by mid-2022 – and that by the close of 2021 at least 40% of people in every country should be vaccinated.\n\nIt\'s now clear that more than 90 countries will miss even that more modest 40% target. ""Some of these countries are in South and Southeast Asia, as well as some in Central and South America,"" notes Udayakumar. ""But the majority are in Sub-Saharan Africa.""\n\nWhat\'s more, he says, these countries haven\'t just missed the 40% target – they are often well below it. In the lower-income countries that qualify for free or highly subsidized vaccines from COVAX, ""the average vaccination rate is closer to 20% than 40% right now,"" says Udayakumar. And in sub-saharan Africa, many countries are stuck at vaccination rates in the single digits.\n\n""It\'s quite concerning because we know that this is leading to exactly the type of situation where infections are raging around the world,"" says Udayakumar. ""We\'re losing lives unnecessarily. We\'re seeing enormous economic damages. But it\'s also setting up the petri dish in essence to create new variants over time. All of us remain unsafe so long as we\'re not doing everything possible to more aggressively vaccinate.""\n\nThe situation would have been worse without COVAX ...\n\nAs disappointing as the progress has been, says Udayakumar, ""we would be in a worse situation than we are right now if COVAX didn\'t exist."" To date it has distributed more than 800 million doses of vaccine to more than 140 countries – ""many of which wouldn\'t get access to vaccines as quickly or in the amounts that they have otherwise.""\n\n... but COVAX was doomed to fall short\n\nUdayakumar says COVAX has ""fallen short"" due to ""naive thinking"" behind its set up – specifically a failure to anticipate that wealthy countries were going to rush to buy up virtually all of the vaccine supply from manufacturers through pre-purchase agreements.\n\nGAVI\'s Seth Berkley recalls how fierce the contest was. ""We were competing against countries that had opened their treasuries and had the [clout] to demand that vaccines flowed to them,"" he says.\n\nThe result was that once vaccines started becoming available, that early supply was almost entirely earmarked for wealthy countries. And vaccines are still only slowly making their way to the rest of the world, as wealthy countries continue to bring in many more doses than they are actually using each month.\n\nIndeed, says Udayakumar, the same problem has hampered a similar effort by African nations to band together to buy vaccines for their continent. The initiative – called the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust, or AVATT – ""has agreements for hundreds of millions of doses. It has been able to deliver many fewer than that,"" notes Udayakumar. ""It\'s a matter of having paid for doses that haven\'t arrived yet. So the real challenge comes back to decision-making by high-income countries, as well as the manufacturers themselves, when they have sold three, four or five times what they can produce at any point in time, they\'re having to make decisions about who is getting doses first. And almost across the board those doses have gone to high-income countries first.""\n\nEarly funding for COVAX could have helped\n\nAdding to COVAX\'s difficulties, says Berkley: ""You\'d want to have financing on day one. We started with zero, and of course that meant we couldn\'t put orders in early,"" he says.\n\nEventually COVAX was able to raise funds from donor countries and organizations. But, says Berkley, ""it took us until the end of [2020] to get the first $2.4 billion in commitments."" Even at that point the cash actually delivered to COVAX was ""very low,"" he adds. ""I think $400 million.""\n\nIf COVAX had been fully funded from the start, says Berkley, ""even if you couldn\'t compete with the U.S. treasury or the European union, you might be able to do technology transfers."" Specifically, COVAX could have more quickly expanded the pool of vaccine suppliers by identifying manufacturing plants with the capacity to produce vaccines – then providing them the funding and assistance to learn how to produce some of the vaccine candidates.\n\nAs it was, COVAX only had the resources to work with a few companies, says Berkley – the most prominent of which was Serum Institute of India or SII. Then, last spring, soon after SII began producing doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, India was hit with a massive wave of cases. The government mandated that all of SII\'s COVID vaccines be redirected for India\'s domestic use. ""It meant that all of a sudden, the 350 million doses we had expected to have for [COVAX-supported] countries wasn\'t there,"" notes Berkley. The situation delayed the roll-out of vaccines to African countries in particular by months. And although India lifted the export ban last October, SII is only just ramping up the number of doses it is sending to COVAX.\n\nThe Serum Institute of India debacle may have been unavoidable\n\nAs problematic as COVAX\'s reliance on SII has proved, says Berkley, ""If today I was doing it, I would do exactly the same thing."" That\'s because faced with such limited funds, COVAX had to go with the company most likely to be capable of scaling up quickly. SII well suited to doing so – ""it\'s the largest manufacturer in the world [of vaccines] by volume,"" notes Berkley. But there also simply weren\'t that many other candidates.\n\nThere\'s a need for more vaccine manufacturers\n\nThis paucity of vaccine makers in developing countries needs to be fixed, says Udayakumar. ""The place where the vaccines are manufactured makes a huge difference,"" he says. ""We\'ve seen manufacturing that\'s been mostly in high-income countries as well as in India and China. And those are the regions that have gotten access to vaccines most quickly. We need now much more sustainable vaccine manufacturing across Sub-Saharan Africa as well as Latin America and south and Southeast Asia.""\n\nWhat it will take to make that happen is now the subject of lively and complex debate. But Udayakumar says at best it will take ""months to years"" to achieve.\n\nDonated doses are a short-term solution – but only if done right\n\nTo ease the current supply crunch COVAX is facing, it would be helpful for wealthy countries to to ramp up donations of excess vaccines that they\'ve already purchased, says Udayakumar. And already, he notes, ""almost 2 billion doses of vaccine have now been pledged to be donated mostly from high-income countries with over 1.1 billion of that pledge coming just from the U.S The U.S. has also shipped more than 300 million doses of donated vaccine, which is more than every other country combined at the moment.""\n\nUnfortunately, adds Udayakumar, ""maybe a quarter of what\'s been pledged has actually been shipped – much less gotten to the countries that need them.""\n\nBerkley adds that another difficulty is that those donated doses arrive ""sometimes with short shelf life. Also, he says, ""one of the challenges is to try to make sure those donations ideally, are not earmarked [for specific countries] ... and that we get enough time for countries to know they\'re coming, so countries can plan.""\n\nGetting enough vaccines is only the first hurdle COVAX faces\n\nWhile supply delays remain the biggest obstacle to increasing vaccination rates in lower income countries, Udayakumar says he\'s optimistic that the problem will soon be eased.\n\n""I think there are at least some glimmers of hope on the horizon in that the supplies are increasing rapidly.""\n\nMore worrying, he says, is a continued lack of adequate financing and preparation for the logistical task of administering doses. ""The greatest challenge is less about getting the vaccines from manufacturers to airports, and now much more about getting vaccines from airports to arms.""'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/01/14/1072188527/for-the-36-countries-with-the-lowest-vaccination-rates-supply-isnt-the-only-issu', 'Headline': 'Interactive map shows global COVID vaccination rates. 36 nations are ...', 'Snippet': 'Interactive map shows global COVID vaccination rates. 36 nations are under 10% : Goats and Soda Even as wealthy countries hit 80% vaccination rates, a number of countries have not even vaccinated ...', 'Full_text': 'In the United States and many other wealthy countries, you can get a free COVID vaccine at supermarkets, pharmacies and clinics.\n\nIn other countries, it\'s a very different story.\n\n""The vaccine is not available in the North (of Yemen),"" says Jasmin Lavoie with the Norwegian Refugee Council, who\'s based in the northern city of Sana\'a.

Even then, after such a treacherous journey through a war zone, it\'s not clear if doses would be available. Like many low-income countries, Yemen has struggled to get hold of vaccine.\n\nLoading...\n\n""Yemen has been one of the places with the lowest vaccination rates in the world,"" says Lavoie. ""And that\'s despite the fact that we\'ve experienced three waves of COVID."" Currently fewer than 2% of Yemenis are fully vaccinated.\n\nYemen is one of 36 countries that fall below the 10% immunization threshold, some with rates under 2%. Much of the mid-section of Africa is in that category, including powerful economic and political players like Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nBy contrast, many wealthy countries have fully vaccinated more than 80% of their citizens.\n\nWhy Africa lags so far behind\n\nMaaza Seyoum with the African Alliance, a South Africa-based advocacy group, says there are many factors playing in to the low vaccination rates in many countries on the continent but the biggest issue is simply that African nations have struggled to get doses.\n\n""Initially, 100 percent, I would say the problem was a lack of access (to vaccines) and a global system that did not prioritize African countries,"" Maaza says. Wealthy nations bought up far more pharmaceutical firms vaccine production than they could even use. The WHO-backed COVAX program faltered as it relied heavily on voluntary donations and on manufacturers in India who were blocked from exporting doses when COVID case numbers skyrocketed on the sub-continent. Some African countries managed to get supplies from China but Beijing often prioritized donations to wealthier trading partners.\n\nThat situation has changed, says Maaza. Recently vaccine deliveries to Africa have increased. But now there are new problems: the shipments are haphazard and sometimes consist of less popular brands that are about to expire.\n\n""Now we\'re seeing the sort of drip, drip, drip of vaccines,"" she says. ""People are waiting for vaccines to come. They come, then they stop.""\n\nThis unpredictable supply chain, she says, makes it nearly impossible for African countries to plan nationwide vaccination drives. And in some of these places where hardly anyone has gotten the jab, rumors about the mysterious vaccine have flourished and augmented vaccine hesitancy.\n\n""The truth is, there is vaccine hesitancy everywhere,"" Maaza says. ""But as people are waiting, it leaves kind of a fertile ground for these rumors to circulate.""\n\nWhich makes convincing people to come to a clinic and get immunized even more of a challenge.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhat\'s behind those under 10% vaccination numbers\n\nThe World Health Organization set a goal of trying to push all countries to 40% vaccine coverage by the end of 2021. The 36 countries still under 10% obviously didn\'t even get close. Kate O\'Brien, the director of immunization and vaccines for the World Health Organization, says this is a significant problem.\n\n""For countries that are struggling to get even above 10%, what this means is that health-care workers are not fully vaccinated yet,"" she says. ""It means older age populations, those who have underlying medical conditions, the people at highest risk are not fully protected yet.""\n\nShe acknowledges vaccine supply inequity as a major part of why rates are so low in these three dozen countries but says there are other reasons too. Many of these countries had health systems that were struggling even before the pandemic to meet local medical needs. Some of them have needed to upgrade refrigeration systems to be able to store certain mRNA vaccines at extremely low temperatures. Others need syringes. All of this takes money that many low-income nations health ministries may not have.\n\n""A COVID vaccine campaign does require funding,"" O\'Brien says. Countries need money ""to deploy new health workers and to assure that the clinics have the resources that they need.""\n\nAnd while there has been some international assistance to lower-income nations to help, that financing has also at times been haphazard and unpredictable.\n\nOngoing conflicts present another obstacle\n\nAway from Africa, the other nations that haven\'t yet gotten above 10% COVID vaccine coverage are some of the most troubled in the world, including Yemen as well as Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti.\n\nCurrently the armed conflict has displaced 4 million of 30 million Yemenis from their homes. Various groups control different parts of the country. According to the U.N. more than 2/3rds of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance. Yet international aid agencies have struggled to meet those needs and keep their operations running in the country due to the ongoing insecurity and a lack of funding.\n\nFor most people in Yemen, life is incredibly difficult. COVID vaccinations are ""not on the top of the list of priorities for many people in Yemen,"" Jasmin Lavoie with NRC says. He says most Yemenis spend their days trying to find food, shelter, decent toilets and worrying about whether they\'ll have to flee fighting once again. ""These are reasons why people are not getting vaccinated too,"" he adds.\n\nThere are similar issues in other conflict zones. ""In a place like Afghanistan, in a place like Syria, COVID is not their number one priority,"" says Paul Spiegel, who runs the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSpiegel returned to Baltimore from working in Afghanistan in mid-December. ""[Vaccination] campaigns are happening,"" he says but adds that the immunization drives are constrained by the limited shipments of vaccine. ""A fair bit of it is Johnson and Johnson, which makes a lot of sense in Afghanistan situation because it\'s just one dose,"" he notes.\n\nBut similar to Yemen, the social upheaval in Afghanistan, with the U.S. departing and the Taliban returning to power, has pushed COVID to the backburner. Vaccine drives are not a top priority for the Taliban, even though it has said it supports vaccination drives by COVAX and the U.N.\n\nNor is it a priority among Afghans. ""Right now there\'s such a dire humanitarian situation there,"" he says. ""[Afghans] are worried about getting food on the table, they\'re worried about feeding their kids. And so COVID is not a priority for the average person.""'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/covid-19-vaccination-rates-by-country', 'Headline': 'COVID-19 Vaccination Rates by Country - U.S. News & World Report', 'Snippet': 'Our World in Data also publishes data on COVID-19 fatality rates, in which low-income countries also experience worse outcomes.

According to Our World in Data, an online publication whose research team is based at the University of Oxford, as of Nov. 6, about 80% of people in high-income countries had received at least one vaccine dose compared to only 23% of those in low-income countries.\n\nHigh-income countries had given a first dose to a majority of their populations by early July 2021. During that same time, low-income countries had barely passed 1%. Well over a year later, that same scenario is repeating itself for booster doses: As of Nov. 6, over 60% of people in high-income countries had received a booster dose, compared to only 1.4% of those in low-income countries.\n\nOur World in Data also publishes data on COVID-19 fatality rates, in which low-income countries also experience worse outcomes.

The main driver of this latest surge is the more infectious BA.2 sub-lineage of the omicron variant, which has been becoming more common ever since Christmas.\n\nIn the UK, increased social mixing and waning vaccine effectiveness – even in those who have had a booster dose – are contributing to this rise. But we’re also seeing huge spikes in areas that had previously kept themselves fairly COVID-free – New Zealand, Hong Kong and South Korea, for example.\n\nCase rates in these places are currently outstripping those seen in many European countries when they were at their worst, despite these newly struggling countries tending to follow rigorous zero COVID policies, with tight border controls and strict internal measures to limit infections. The highly infectious new variant having a bigger effect in places where restrictions are tighter. But why?\n\nZero cases equals delayed cases\n\nLong before COVID, it was known that non-pharmaceutical control measures – whether within a country or at its border – rarely stop a pandemic spreading. Usually, these things – lockdowns, quarantines and so on – only delay a disease’s spread. However, this may be sufficient to flatten the curve of infections and ease pressure on health services, or to reduce illness and death by delaying most infections until treatments have improved or vaccines become available.\n\nIn reality, the most influential disease-control factor is immunity, which can be generated by infection or vaccination. Both are important. As I pointed out last summer, the end of the pandemic in any country will likely depend on the proportion of people who have already had a COVID infection, and not just the proportion vaccinated.\n\nBreakthrough infections in those who are vaccinated will drive their immunity to a higher level, while in the unvaccinated an infection provides a level of protection that would otherwise have been absent. In fact, immunity following an infection now gives rather better protection against being infected in the future than immunity from a booster vaccine, especially once 90 days have passed since being vaccinated.\n\nThis helps to explain why some countries are now handling outbreaks better than others. In the UK, despite excellent vaccination coverage, the majority of people have also now caught COVID, and many people have caught COVID more than once. Cases are high for sure, but not as high as in some of these Pacific countries, and rates of death and severe disease are remaining at a relatively low level.\n\nIn comparison, countries that followed a zero COVID strategy are now seeing a larger surge in infections and deaths as they open up, even if they have high vaccine coverage. Their lack of prior infections means immunity across the population is lower.\n\nVaccines still making a difference\n\nBut despite the fact that both Hong Kong and New Zealand have both suffered huge rises in viral transmission recently, the impact on public health in the two places has been dramatically different.\n\nNew Zealand, with high vaccine coverage and a recent booster programme, is weathering this surge with far fewer deaths so far. Hong Kong has seen many more deaths, with a death rate per million people in the four weeks up to March 18 2022 that’s 38 times as great as in New Zealand.\n\nThe difference is down to the vaccination campaigns in these two places. In Hong Kong, at least up to the end of February, the uptake of the booster vaccine was much lower than in New Zealand, and was particularly low in older, more vulnerable age groups. Even second-dose coverage was low in these groups, meaning plenty were at a high risk of severe disease and death.\n\nDid the UK get it right?\n\nMy own country, the UK, decided to lift its remaining restrictions earlier this year, even though cases were still high when controls were eased and remain high now. Was this the right thing to do?\n\nThere’s no right answer, but given that non-pharmaceutical control measures only delay infections rather than prevent them, such measures should only continue if the benefits of delaying infections outweigh the more general harms to society and human health that come with restricting people’s freedoms. Given the high levels of immunity across the British population that have resulted from high case levels and good vaccine coverage, lifting controls made sense.\n\nThere’s also another important point to consider here. It’s been well publicised that the vaccines’ protective effect against catching the virus and developing symptoms wanes more quickly than protection against severe disease and death. However, there’s emerging evidence (still in preprint, so awaiting review by other scientists) that protection against severe disease also wanes with time.\n\nWhat this means is that delaying infections could result in people getting COVID at a later date when they are more susceptible to getting badly ill. This was predicted in some of the disease modelling of omicron published at the end of last year (also still in preprint). Imposing additional restrictions in December 2021 would have reduced COVID deaths in January 2022, but at the cost of increased deaths in March.\n\nPersonally, I would have preferred to wait till the end of March to lift restrictions, so that we were into spring, when respiratory viruses spread less rapidly. That could have reduced the current NHS pressures stemming from staff absences.\n\nAnd finally, even though lifting controls made sense, today the UK still has a population of older or clinically vulnerable people who have not yet had the virus and whose vaccine immunity is waning. We must focus now on preventing these people from developing severe disease – perhaps through further vaccine boosters or use of antiviral drugs – rather than on attempting to reduce transmission in the general population.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o102/rr-18', 'Headline': 'All-cause Mortality vs Covid-19 vaccination | The BMJ', 'Snippet': 'Beattie [2], despite implying a ""causal impact"" of vaccination upon increased Covid case rates and mortality rates, did not diminish my sense of confidence in Covid19 vaccination.

People who are older or more likely to become very ill or die from COVID-19 are usually prioritized over those who are young and healthy. Some groups are prioritized because they are more likely to come into contact with an infected person based on what they do or where they live and, in turn, infect others.\n\nReuters has collected information on these priority groups for dozens of countries and determined which groups are currently eligible for vaccination.\n\nTap through the table below to see detailed information for each country.

But a Twitter user falsely implied that the death rate for the unvaccinated included people who had only one or two doses of a vaccine. The CDC said “unvaccinated” means someone has “not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine.”\n\nFull Story\n\nA Feb. 5 tweet from President Joe Biden’s official government Twitter account — @POTUS — said that “unvaccinated individuals are 97 times more likely to die” from COVID-19 “compared to those who are boosted.”\n\nThat’s accurate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most recent analysis of data from 24 U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nThe CDC says that, as of Dec. 4, the weekly COVID-19 death rate among unvaccinated adults was 9.74 per 100,000 population, and the rate was 0.1 per 100,000 population for people 18 and older who were fully vaccinated with a booster dose.\n\nThe White House confirmed in an email to FactCheck.org that the tweet was based on the CDC’s data from early December.\n\nHowever, a Twitter user falsely implied that the death rate for the unvaccinated was inflated by including people who had received only one or two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n“Here’s the deal: classifying people who have 1 or 2 jabs as ‘unvaccinated’ is ridiculous,” Libertarians: Diligently Plotting tweeted in response to the POTUS account. An image of that tweet was posted to the Facebook page of “Libertarians: Diligently Plotting to Take Over the World & Leave You Alone,” which has over 71,000 followers.\n\nBut the CDC said it only counted people who had not received any COVID-19 vaccine doses as unvaccinated.\n\nA footnote on the CDC’s “Rates of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Vaccination Status” webpage says “unvaccinated” means people who have “not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine.” In addition, that CDC page says “partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series” were excluded.\n\nFor most people, the primary vaccination series is: two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, given three weeks apart; two doses of the Moderna vaccine, given four weeks apart; or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Someone is not considered “fully vaccinated” until at least 14 days after the second dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine or at least 14 days after one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\nWhat’s more, the CDC separately tracks fully vaccinated people who have only received the primary vaccination series. As of Dec. 4, the weekly COVID-19 death rate among adults “fully vaccinated without booster dose” was 0.71 per 100,000 — which was about seven times higher than the rate for those fully vaccinated who also had received a booster shot.\n\nWe’ve reproduced the graph from the CDC’s page below:\n\nHere’s how CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky explained the data in a Feb. 2 press briefing by the White House COVID-\u206019 Response Team and public health officials:\n\nWalensky, Feb. 2: Similar to what I showed you last week, vaccination and booster doses substantially decrease the risk of death from COVID-19. Looking at the data from the week ending Dec. 4, the number of average weekly deaths for those who are unvaccinated was 9.7 per 100,000 people, but only 0.7 per 100,000 people for those who were vaccinated.\n\nThis means the risk of dying from COVID-19 was 14 times higher for people who were unvaccinated compared to those who received only a primary series.\n\nFor those who were boosted, the average of weekly deaths was 0.1 per 100,000 people, meaning that unvaccinated individuals were 97 times more likely to die compared to those who were boosted.\n\nShe clearly provided different COVID-19 risk assessments for the unvaccinated, the fully vaccinated without a booster and the fully vaccinated who had been boosted.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

COVID-19, a communicable disease caused by the viral pathogen SARS-COV-2, continues to have multi-dimensional impacts all over the world [2,3,4]. Since its nominal emergence (31 December 2019), the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the food security of people across the world [5,6,7,8,9]. Specifically, the pandemic has impacting the food security of individuals and communities both directly and indirectly by overwhelming the agricultural productivity, exacerbating the energy poverty [10], and diminishing personal health and financial stability [11,12,13]. Prior to COVID-19, approximately 820 million individuals faced hunger each day globally, with over two billion individuals experiencing micronutrient deficiencies. These dietary issues in turn lead to increased risk of mortality and morbidities [14, 15]. COVID-19’s emergence resulted in disruptions to the production, processing, transporting, and marketing of food [15], which has caused flow-on impacts to food security. For example, fresh food products, including meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables, all recorded extensive price increases due to obstructions in transport channels [16]. A joint statement released in 2020 by the World Health Organization, (WHO) amongst others [14], reported that 3.3 billion global workers were identified as being at risk of losing their livelihood due to COVID-19. COVID-19 had exacerbated the already existing malnutrition in children. Further, 149 million children were estimated to have growth abnormalities, such as stunted (reduced in their growth performance), globally due to COVID-19 and other confounding factors, including natural disasters like drought, desert locust emergence, war and displacement [17]. The food security issues that arose due to COVID-19 were felt globally [18, 19], however, the level of crisis was more significant in lower-income countries [15] than in middle- and high-income countries.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) [1], there are four food security dimensions: availability; accessibility; usability; and sustainability/stability. Food availability is defined as the presence of adequate amount of food that satisfies the demand of the general population within a specified territory [20], while accessibility is the retrievability of food without excessive physical and/or economic barriers [21]. Usability of food refers to the nutritional quality of food and focuses on whether the accessible and available food is balanced, healthy, and nutritious [21]. This available and accessible food should then be able to satisfy the dietary and nutritional demands of the individual, households, community and/or the general population [20,21,22]. This food should be sustainable/stable by being available, accessible, and useful for a prolonged time [15, 20, 21]. All the four dimensions of food security are interdependent to each other and the effects of a certain factor that impacts one dimension can directly or indirectly overwhelm another [1]. As such, it is not appropriate to talk about food security using only one food security dimension. For instance, it is meaningless to discuss food accessibility, stability, and usability if food is not available and it is not rational to talk about food usability if food is not accessible.\n\nA recent article has identified the burden of COVID-19 pandemic on all the four dimensions [23], while another examined some of the food security dimensions [24]. Interestingly, findings from Iran showed that the emergence of COVID-19 had short term positive impact on food security of households and individuals [25]. Studies on the impact of COVID-19 were conducted in different geographic locations of the world, but the findings are currently inconsistent and sometimes contradictory. As a result, a compiled summary of all the available information, and which is informative for policy makers, food input suppliers, aid agencies and governmental and non-governmental bodies, is considered an appropriate research goal. In addition, identifying whether (and which) different food security dimensions have been impacted to greater or lesser extents during COVID-19 may assist local, regional and national government bodies in mitigating any emerging food insecurity issues.\n\nTo achieve these outcomes, a systematic review was conducted of all studies regarding COVID-19’s impact on food security. This paper examines the extent to which food security was directly and indirectly compromised by COVID-19, and how food security actors recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic induced food insecurity trauma. The application of findings of this systematic review are not necessarily restricted explicitly to COVID-19 as they may also have potential significance in early preparedness of the inevitable future pandemics. The purpose of this article was to summarise the food security impact of COVID-19 and pointing out the critically impacted dimension/s of food security. The specific questions that guided this systematic review were:\n\n1.\n\nHow much was food security directly and indirectly affected by COVID-19?\n\n2.\n\nWhich, if any, dimensions of food security were significantly compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nMethodology\n\nThis systematic review was undertaken in line with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines [26] and checklist [additional file 1]. In addition, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) systematic review checklist was used as a second point of reference to guide the process. Prior to the systematic review commencing, a protocol was prepared and registered in ROSPERO database with registration number CRD42022325475 and it was published online [27]. As indicated in the following sub-headings, each aspect of the PRISMA checklist was addressed sequentially.\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nPrimary research articles conducted on COVID-19’s impact on food security were the focus of the systematic review. However, so as to allow for comparative analysis of the burden of COVID-19, potential articles had to specifically focus on at least one of the four defined dimensions (food availability, accessibility, usability and stability) both prior to and/or following the emergence of COVID-19. No restrictions were placed on study design, with any qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method studies considered. Other types of literature (grey literature, review articles, protocols, reports, letters to editors and unpublished studies) were excluded from review. The reasons for excluding information sources other than primary research articles were to ensure the goal of identifying information from the primary source, and which were supported with data and followed expected research standards and procedures.\n\nIt is expected that primary research articles published in different languages on the topic of interest might be available in online information sources (databases), but only studies written in English were included. The timeframe for publication was from the approximate time of emergence of COVID-19 (31 December 2019) through to the end of this systematic review’s literature search (15 May 2022) were included.\n\nInformation sources, search strategy, and selection process\n\nFour databases (Web of Science; Scopus; PubMed; and Google Scholar) were used as the literature sources. The data from these four databases was identified from the nominal date for COVID-19 pandemic emergence (31/12/2019) through to 15/05/2022. All reference lists from the studies identified through the initial database searches were then explicitly assessed to avoid missing any relevant data source.\n\nA combination of search terms was used. The same terms were used for three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science), and search strings were applied according to the relevant database. As explained in the protocol [27], the search terms used for Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed were “Impact” OR “Effect” OR “Burden” AND “COVID 19”) OR “COVID-19 pandemic” OR “SARS COV 2” OR “Coronavirus disease 2019” OR “Coronavirus diseases 19” OR “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2”) AND “Food Security” OR “Food Insecurity” OR “Food Security dimension”. The publication date (31/12/2019—15/05/2022), the publication language (English), and the article type (primary research articles) were used as a filtering mechanism during the searching process. For identifying literature from Google Scholar, the short title of this systematic review (the COVID-19’s impact on food security, availability, accessibility, usability and stability) was used, and any potentially relevant articles that were not identified from other databases were included. Details of the search strategy for each database is described as follows.\n\nScopus: ( ALL ( impact) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( effect) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( burden) AND ALL ( covid 19) OR ALL ( covid-19 AND pandemic) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( sars AND cov 2) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( coronavirus AND disease 2019) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( coronavirus AND diseases 19) OR ABS ( severe AND acute AND respiratory AND syndrome AND coronavirus-2) AND ALL ( food AND security) OR ALL ( food AND insecurity) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( food AND security AND dimension)) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE, ""ar"")) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( PUBSTAGE, ""final"")) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( LANGUAGE, ""English"")).\n\nPubMed: (((((((((((Impact[Title/Abstract]) OR (Effect[Title])) OR (Burden[Title])) AND (COVID 19[Title/Abstract])) OR (COVID-19 Pandemic[Title/Abstract])) OR (SARS COV 2[Title/Abstract])) OR (Coronavirus disease 2019[Title/Abstract])) OR (Coronavirus diseases 19[Title/Abstract])) OR (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2[Title/Abstract])) AND (Food Security[Title/Abstract])) OR (Food Insecurity[Title/Abstract])) OR (Food Security dimension[Title/Abstract]).\n\nWeb of Science: Impact (All Fields) OR Effect (Abstract) OR Burden (Abstract) AND COVID 19 (All Fields) OR COVID-19 pandemic (All Fields) OR SARS COV 2 (Title) OR Coronavirus disease 2019 (All Fields) OR Coronavirus disease 19 (All Fields) OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (Abstract) AND Food Security (All Fields) OR Food Insecurity (All Fields) OR Food Security dimension (Abstract) and 2020 or 2021 or 2022 (Publication Years) and Article (Document Types) and English (Languages).\n\nGoogle scholar: COVID-19, Food Security, Impact, OR COVID-19, OR Pandemic, OR Food OR security, OR availability, OR accessibility, OR usability, OR stability.\n\nThe first author conducted the primary screening, and the same process was repeated by the other team members to ensure the validity and reliability of selection processes. Identification of potentially eligible studies was conducted initially through title and abstract screening, prior to a full text review occurring. A pre-determined process for resolving any disagreements was established, however ultimately there were no disagreements in the selection process among the review authors.\n\nData items and collection process\n\nStudies selected from the four databases were imported to EndNote X9. Literature searches were undertaken on 01 May 2022 for the first time and repeated 2 weeks later for the second time. The identified articles were de-duplicated using EndNote X9’s unique identifier function. Any redundant studies missed by the EndNote unique identifier were manually de-duplicated. The studies were considered regardless of the studies’ statistical analysis, geographic coverage, and study participants (individual, household, community or country). All COVID-19 related factors that exacerbated the food insecurity of individuals/households, such as COVID-19 prevention restrictions, agricultural production interruptions, job losses, import–export bans, and mortality of productive workforces, were synthesised into the final results.\n\nStudy risk of bias assessment\n\nThe Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used for assessing the risk of biases. The eight items of the JBI checklist are designed for assessing the risk of biases in reviewing primary studies with Yes, No, Unclear or Not Applicable answers. The items of the checklist are: 1) the inclusion and exclusion criteria of samples; 2) study subjects and settings; 3) exposure measurement validity and reliability; 4) objective and standard criteria of condition measurement; 5) identification of confounding factors; 6) strategies to deal with confounding factors; 7) validity and reliability of outcome measures; and 8) the use of appropriate statistical analysis in included studies.\n\nBased on the JBI critical appraisal checklist, each included study was independently appraised by a second author and no disagreement were raised among team members.\n\nEffect measures and synthesis methods\n\nCOVID-19-related food production or supply chain restrictions was considered as impacts on food availability. Food security reductions due to physical or economic constraints during COVID-19 were classified as food inaccessibility. The food quality and diversity reduction during the pandemic was interpreted as the impact of COVID-19 on food usability. Short-term food items availability that cannot be sustained due to the direct (effect on the food supply chain) and indirect (health and economic burdens) impacts were deemed to be food stability issues. Food insecurity increases during COVID-19 as compared with pre-pandemic food insecurity were expressed in the form of percentages. Overall, one or more food security dimension/s that was/were repeatedly reported by the majority of the included studies was identified as significantly altered dimension by COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSynthesis of this systematic review was focused on investigating COVID-19’s impact on food security and/or its four dimensions (availability, accessibility, usability and stability). Any included studies that failed to consider relevant confounding food insecurity drivers were critically appraised in the discussion and risk of bias assessment sections of this systematic review.\n\nReporting bias and certainty assessments\n\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) tool was used for assessing reporting biases in the studies. As recommended by Berkman et al. [28], the authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the papers using the AHRQ checklists. Based on the checklists, the studies with a high probability of reporting bias were categorised as “suspected” and the studies with a low probability of bias were noted as “undetected.” The certainties of evidence were assessed using the GRADE tool. The alignment of findings, the consistency of evidence, the level of suspected publication biases, the limitations of reviewed studies, and the availability of target outcomes in the reviewed studies were considered as factors for certainty.\n\nStudy selection\n\nOf the initial sample of 2,057 studies identified through the first search, 1,220 were found through database searching and the remaining 837 were from other sources, such as the aforementioned review of reference lists (Fig. 1). Of the 1220 papers found through database searches, 27 were identified as eligible for review, but 20 were removed due to the lack of pre-COVID-19 food security information. Fourteen potentially eligible studies were identified from other sources; 11 of these were removed because they were duplicates of studies already identified. Overall, this resulted in seven studies from the database search and three studies from other sources being included in the final sample of ten papers (Fig. 1). The study by Pradeilles et al. [29] in Peru was initially considered eligible to be included for review, but was removed due to a lack of pre-COVID-19 data for the food insecurity experience scale (FIES) indicator.\n\nCharacteristics of the reviewed studies\n\nTwo papers were published in 2020, seven in 2021, and one in 2022 (Table 1). Three studies [18, 30, 31] were conducted in the United States of America and the remaining studies included countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, Uganda, Kenya, Chile, Mexico, Lebanon, and Iran (Table 1). Only one study [16] covered the food insecurity prevalence of two countries (Kenya & Uganda), with the others covering either a single county or a province [25, 32] in a single country, or populations [30, 31] in the same country.\n\nThe summarised objective of all reviewed studies was to determine COVID-19’s burden on food security and associated dimension/s using the pre and post-COVID-19 food security analysis (Table 1). Four studies [25, 32,33,34] assessed the food security levels of households, three [16, 18, 36] identified the effect of the pandemic on the food security of individuals, while two studies [30, 31] investigated food insecurity levels in college students before and at the time of the pandemic in the United States of America. The remaining study [35] assessed food security of mothers before and after the pandemic in Bangladesh. The majority (8 out of 10) of the studies used a cross-sectional study design (Table 1) and the remaining studies used interrupted time series [35], and predictive model [36] designs. As indicated by Gaitán-Rossi et al. [33], food security of households with children was reduced. Contrary to the majority (9 out of 10) of the studies, the research conducted in Iran’s Tehran province [25] reported that the emergence of COVID-19 resulted in improved food security among households.\n\nRisk of bias in studies\n\nBased on the JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies, six studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias in all 8 items of the checklist while 4 studies [25, 32, 35, 36] were found to have unclear risk of bias in four items (Q1, Q3, Q4, and Q6) of the checklist (Table 2). Eight of the included studies used cross-sectional study design and the remaining two studies [35 and 36] had used predictive model and interrupted time series study designs. The JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies was designed for analytical cross-sectional studies and it was challenging to find a specific and appropriate risk of bias assessment tool for the two studies that used a predictive model [36] and interrupted time series [35]. Since the main difference of these study designs from cross-sectional methodologies is time-frame and ways of measurement, the JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies was considered still potentially suitable for predictive model and interrupted time series designs, and was therefore used.\n\nThe compromised food security dimension and its associated factors\n\nA majority (9 out of 10) of the studies used validated food security indicators, while one [36] of the studies estimated the food insecurity prevalence using a predictive model from previous food insecurity trends. The most compromised food security dimension identified across nine studies was the accessibility of food, with all the studies reporting that economic crisis due to COVID-19 was the main cause of food inaccessibility (Table 3). Two studies [16, 32] confirmed that the usability (quality) of food was reduced during COVID-19 and that food diversity during COVID-19 was less than the food diversity before the emergence of the pandemic. The study from Iran [25] reported that the food diversity (usability/quality) of households had actually increased following COVID-19 and the food security was improved. This was in contrast to the study conducted in Indonesia [32] which indicated that food access, availability, and usability were all compromised by COVID-19.\n\nTwo studies [30, 31] examined food security using prior and following the pandemic emergence food security levels of individuals. Both papers identified the negative impact of COVID-19 on food security, with food security status reduced during the pandemic as compared with the pre-pandemic food security status (Table 4). The remaining eight studies explored COVID-19 related food security using pre- and post-COVID-19 emergence food insecurity prevalence.\n\nRisk of reporting bias in reviewed studies\n\nEach reviewed study was assessed using the AHRQ bias assessment criteria. Berkman et al. [28] noted that the reporting of bias assessment outcomes using this tool shall be either “suspected” or “undetected”. If the reviewer cannot identify any reporting bias from studies, it is recommended to say ‘undetected’ than to say ‘free from reporting biases’. Based on this tool (AHRQ), the reporting biases of the majority (9 out of 10) of the reviewed studies were assessed as “undetected” as indicated by the tick “√” symbol in Table 5. The study [36] that used a predictive model for estimating food insecurity was assessed as being “suspected” of bias, as the study was based on the food insecurity data 2–4 years before the occurrence of the pandemic and did not necessarily report on data indicative of the current situation immediately prior to and during the pandemic. Since there might be unidentified food insecurity variation during that longer time period, it was considered potentially problematic to compare the food insecurity during COVID-19 with the situation greater than 2 years prior to the pandemic’s emergence. As a result, the food insecurity report by Kharroubi et al. [36] was suspected of potential bias.\n\nCertainty of evidence\n\nBased on the GRADE Pro handbook the certainty of results was assessed in three modalities (low, very low, moderate, and high). Each study was judged based on the pre-set criteria (Table 6). The study that included pre and post-COVID-19 emergence food security data, identified impacted food security dimension/s, and used collected data instead of estimations was categorised as having a ‘high’ certainty of evidence. The evidence from the majority (9 out of 10) of the studies had high certainty of evidence. The remaining paper [36], which used retrospective data collected 2–4 years before the emergence of COVID-19, was categorised as having low certainty of evidence, particularly considering the influences and multifactored nature of food insecurity.\n\nConceptually, food security is a complex and multifaceted issue [37], with four separate dimensions (food access, availability, usability, and stability) and is influenced by biological, social, and economic factors. As a result of its complexity, it is difficult for all dimensions of food security to be covered with any single food security indicator and a combination of tools should be used to examine the impact of COVID-19’s on food security [37, 38]. The current systematic review was designed to assess the COVID-19 related crisis on food security and associated food dimensions. This was undertaken using a pre-and post-comparative analysis by considering the date of COVID-19 emergence as the reference point. The main findings from this systematic review are presented below.\n\nFood insecurity due to COVID-19\n\nNine of the included studies reported that COVID-19 negatively affected food security and reported reduced food security status [30, 31] or increased food insecurity prevalence [16, 18, 32,33,34,35,36]. These articles noted that food security reduction in the form of four food security modalities (high food security, marginal food security, low food security, or very low food security) [9, 16, 35, 39]. In contrast to the other papers, the study conducted in Iran [25] reported that COVID-19 had a positive impact by increasing the food security and dietary diversity of households. The authors of this study [25] justified that the food security and dietary diversity improvement during COVID-19 was due to free food supplements to vulnerable groups, extending e-marketing, delivering nutrition advice, and governmental and non-governmental donations to the people, during the pandemic.\n\nThe largest food insecurity increase (44%) due to COVID-19 was observed in Uganda followed by Kenya [16] with a 38% food insecurity prevalence difference pre-and post-pandemic. This food insecurity prevalence was considered to be largely due to the rural–urban marketing channel disturbance of fresh food products like fish, meat, and vegetables [16]. Except the study conducted in Iran [25], other studies indicated that food security was reduced during COVID-19, with reported figures of 17% in Indonesia [32], 11% in Mexico [33], 19% in Chile [34], 31% in Bangladesh [35], 12% in Lebanon [36], and 8.4% in the USA [18]. In two studies, food security was reduced by 15.7% [34] and 3.34% [30] due to COVID-19 in the United States of America. The economic crisis due to COVID-19, increased unemployment [39], food value chain disturbances [40, 41], marketing channel interruptions [42, 43], and food service provider (hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, and retailers) closures [44] were mentioned as the main constraints of food security during COVID-19. These findings would indicate that proactive planning to facilitate more immediate intervention measures by governmental and non-governmental organizations toward food security resilience are needed for future pandemics [25].\n\nThe compromised food security dimension\n\nThe majority (9 out of 10) of the included studies confirmed that the most affected food security dimension was food access, which is consistent with other research [9, 45] that identified food access as being substantially impacted. It is acknowledged that the included studies didn’t use equivalent methods that equally measure all four of the food security dimensions, and this may have led to some diversity in data. Nonetheless, there was a consistent theme across the majority of papers. It was argued that food inaccessibility was primarily due to the poor economic capacity of consumers. This is not surprising; however, it is worth highlighting that physical food inaccessibility was also considered a result of lockdowns which led to a reduction in food access [30,31,32,33].\n\nIn addition to food accessibility, the availability of food [32, 33], and usability/quality of food [16, 32] were reported as being compromised due to COVID-19. The effect of COVID-19 on food usability was considered to be compromised due to a reduction in food diversity. Specifically, one paper [32] identified that three food security dimensions (accessibility, availability, and usability) were affected due to the restrictions and measures applied for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Once food accessibility or availability is compromised, food stability/sustainability is impacted by default [24, 46]. Lockdown measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 were identified as the main factor for this reduction in food security [47], and this one aspect of food security impacted the entire food system chain [23].\n\nLimitation of the reviewed studies and the review process\n\nThe studies did not necessarily take into account any potential confounding factors, such as illnesses other than COVID-19 [48], natural disasters during COVID-19 (desert locusts in Kenya, Uganda, and Lebanon, and floods in Bangladesh) [49], and climate change at the time of the pandemic [50]. Such factors will also have contributed to the reduction of food security and can therefore obscure the real effect of COVID-19. It is also worth recognising that experience-based food security measures are usually subject to recall biases [51]. Since the included studies used cross-sectional study designs, it is not possible to establish trends of food insecurity developments and to prioritise potential interventions.\n\nDue to time constraints, only primary research articles were included, with brief reports, unpublished studies, reviews, and studies published in languages other than English excluded. This approach to study selection might have excluded relevant literature. This is important as the time delay from doing a study until results are presented in a journal may have meant that potentially relevant papers relating to a recent issue, such as COVID-19, had not yet had sufficient time to be published. Moreover, it is acknowledged that the initial selection system using title and abstract can also be prone to potentially missing relevant studies [52].\n\nThe food security of households and individuals was severely compromised due to COVID-19 emergence. The health, agriculture and socio-economic crises following the COVID-19 pandemic indirectly impacted food security as compared with the pre-pandemic situations. The food accessibility dimension of food security was mainly impacted due to the pandemic. Contrary to the pandemic’s negative impact, integrated food aid interventions by private sectors, and governmental and non-governmental organizations improved food security during COVID-19. Based on this conclusion, the following recommendations were forwarded.\n\nBalancing COVID-19 prevention and food security crises\n\nTo implement either localised or widespread COVID-19 restrictions, such as transport bans, lockdowns, food market chain restrictions, and quarantine, the benefits should outweigh any problems that arise. This is particularly relevant for disadvantaged groups, particularly in low-income countries, where circumstances characterised by ‘hand to mouth’ meant entire communities cannot easily cope with any new food security crises, such as those arising due to COVID-19 prevention measures [53]. Therefore, any COVID-19 prevention restrictions should consider these social groups and balance the positives of reduced COVID-19 transmission arising from such restrictions, against the detrimental impact associated with food security [54].\n\nDecisions that are unidirectionally focused (i.e. focusing on health crisis only) and implemented hastily without due consideration to all possibly factors, may have a catastrophic impact on food security. Unless these decisions are made in integrated manner (for instance in a ‘one health’ approach), emerging crises due to food insecurity might be as devasting as the personal health impact directly from COVID-19. Participating multi-disciplinary professionals, facilitating emergency food aid and SafetyNet programs, and prioritizing the pros and cons of COVID-19 prevention measures before implementation, should all be considered as potential strategies for balancing COVID-19’s prevention measures and arising food security crises.\n\nIntegrated food security interventions\n\nFood insecurity, arising either directly from the pandemic or indirectly due to restrictions applied for its prevention and control, should be mitigated by integrated interventions that are coordinated by governmental and non-governmental organisations, individuals, and institutions. Food security interventions can reduce mortality associated with food insecurity while balancing the need for COVID-19 prevention restrictions [55]. Although the data is limited, the food security crises during COVID-19 appear to be higher in low- and middle-income countries when compared to high-income countries. Therefore, along with the integrated COVID-19 prevention, collaborative food security intervention between countries is recommended as a proactive strategy to alleviate future problems associated with pandemics [56]. There was stepwise food insecurity increments in households with children [33]. Based on this food insecurity trend, it is recommended that food security actors (like food suppliers, aid and agricultural organizations) prioritise households with children. Households and individuals who were vulnerable for food security crises, including those with lower income, unemployed household member, female-leaded household, households with more children, and household members with lower educational level, are particularly highlighted for urgent intervention areas [34].\n\nSupporting food security resilience\n\nThis systematic review found that food security was severely affected by COVID-19. This compromised food security needs to be supported to recover, and communities that experience food insecurity should be proactively assisted to overcome both immediate and emerging crises. To achieve food security resilience, communities needed to be provided with the tools and resources to be more independent. Unless cooperative food insecurity resilience is applied, the vulnerable groups\' morbidity and mortality due to food insecurity will be exacerbated [57].\n\nFuture implications\n\nThere is currently a lack of comparative data examining food security pre and post-COVID-19 emergence, and a more nuanced understanding of these complex issues can only be achieved with a greater focus on these areas. Studies regarding the effect of post-pandemic restrictions on food security, determining the vulnerable groups for food insecurity, identifying the food security resilience methods during and after COVID-19, and investigating the merits and emerging problems arising from COVID-19 prevention measures are all recommended topics for consideration in prospective studies. Considering the limitations of included studies, it is also suggested that future research should consider and evaluate the multiple food security driving factors external to COVID-19 that might increase the food security crisis.\n\nRegistration and protocol\n\nThis systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the registrations number: CRD42022325475. Protocol for the review process was prepared and the review was conducted as per the pre-planned protocol. The protocol is published at PLOS ONE [27] and can be accessed online (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9362949/).\n\nAmendments of published protocol\n\nThe protocol of this systematic review [27] was published before the end of this article. In the protocol, the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool was proposed to be used as a risk of bias assessment tool. Since this tool is more appropriate for systematic reviews than primary studies, the risk of bias of this systematic review was assessed using JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8901427/', 'Headline': 'Hunger relief: A natural experiment from additional SNAP benefits ...', 'Snippet': 'See Brodersen and colleagues 26 for an application measuring the impact of an advertising campaign at Google, De Vocht and colleagues 27 for an application measuring the impact of local alcohol licensing changes on hospital admission and crime rates, and Feroze 28 for an investigation into the effect of lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes.', 'Full_text': 'Access Denied\n\nYour access to the NCBI website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov has been temporarily blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation involving your site.

In addition to the direct impact of the virus on people’s health, local lockdowns, recommendations to self-isolate, and disrupted travel and trade routes, have resulted in people losing their jobs, food shortages, and food prices increasing1,2. This perfect storm of reduced access to, and availability and affordability of, food has resulted in increased food insecurity (defined as existing when “all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”3, in both higher and lower-income countries4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nIn this paper, taking advantage of multiple waves of High Frequency Phone Surveys (HFPS) of households undertaken since the pandemic started, linked to ongoing panel micro studies, we undertake the first multi-country, multi-period analysis of the evolution of food insecurity in lower-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each of the governments of the 11 countries included in our analysis has implemented restrictions that include school closures, travel restrictions, and bans on public gatherings, to contain the spread of the virus10. While the stringency of the government responses were highest during March and April 2020 (in the early stages of the pandemic), some countries such as Djibouti and Mali started to relax their restrictions around July 2020. However, most of the sample countries continued to impose at least some restrictions until the end of 2020. With the rise of COVID-19 cases in the beginning of 2021 (Figure 1 in the Appendix), a number of countries re-imposed restrictions (Fig. 1). Countries have also implemented policies aimed at reducing the negative impacts of the pandemic and the restrictive policies, including emergency investments in healthcare facilities, and new forms of social welfare provision. We particularly focus on the policy interventions undertaken by governments to try to reduce the impact of the pandemic on food insecurity, including the use of food and cash safety nets.\n\nSocial safety nets have long been implemented by governments to protect poor and vulnerable people and improve socioeconomic conditions, and have been highlighted as being particularly important for vulnerable populations affected by negative shocks7,11,12. Government-funded safety nets are common across sub-Saharan Africa, indeed they can be found in every African country13. The explicit link between safety nets and food security, whether in higher or lower-income countries, is well documented in the literature14. Though there is a multitude of different safety nets, two common safety nets employed across many countries are cash transfer programmes and food-based programmes that can variously include providing food, food stamps, food vouchers, and food for work programmes13.\n\nA key debate in the literature, and among policy circles, is the extent to which cash or food assistance has most impact in reducing food insecurity15. Naturally, public nutrition programmes and food safety nets more broadly are designed to directly reduce food insecurity. Yet from a utility-maximising perspective, cash transfers tend to be considered to be more economically efficient because, at the margin, they do not distort consumption and production choices16,17,18. Further, cash transfers are often cheaper administratively18. There are also non-economic reasons for preferring cash to food transfers, such as that they are less “paternalistic”15,19.\n\nDespite theoretical and non-economic rationales for preferring cash to food transfers, there is a considerable body of empirical evidence that, in higher-income countries, in-kind transfers such as food stamps improve household food consumption more than cash transfers15. In lower-income countries, increasingly researchers are using randomised controlled trials, experiments, and regression analysis, to explore empirically whether cash or in-kind transfers are most effective at reducing food insecurity. As such, contextual evidence takes precedence over theoretical underpinnings.\n\nOur empirical findings suggest that safety nets in the form of cash assistance are more likely to reduce the chances of food insecurity among households over time. However, food assistance fails to significantly reduce the probability of food insecurity. Further, households with female and/or relatively less-educated heads, and those that are poorer or experiencing a pandemic-induced loss of income, have a higher chance of suffering food insecurity. We also show that households that were unable to rely on their savings and had to borrow to make ends meet were also more likely to suffer from food insecurity during the pandemic. As such, our paper shows the importance of understanding the socioeconomic underpinnings of COVID-19 impacts. Furthermore, heterogeneities in findings across countries reveal the need for evidence-based policies tailored to local contexts.\n\nData\n\nIn collaboration with international agencies including the European Commission, World Bank, and USAID, High Frequency Phone Surveys (HFPS) to investigate the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic have been conducted in a number of countries (https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/hfps). Many of these surveys are linked to ongoing household surveys and aim to collect information on loss of employment and income, health and wellbeing, impact on education of children, food (in)security, coping strategies adopted, and safety net disbursements. Summaries of these datasets, that we use in this study, are provided in Table 1.\n\nWe use these high-Frequency Phone Survey data on COVID-19 to track the impacts of the pandemic within and across countries. We present and analyse data from eleven countries. Specifically, we look at the following four indicators of household food insecurity from the survey questionnaire:\n\n1.\n\nHave you or any other adult in your household had to skip a meal in the last 30 days?\n\n2.\n\nDid the household go without eating for a whole day in the last 30 days?\n\n3.\n\nDid you or any other adult in your household run out of food in the last 30 days?\n\n4.\n\nWere you or any other member in your household hungry but did not eat in the last 30 days?\n\nAlthough there is considerable consistency across countries with respect to the indicators of food insecurity, coverage does vary from country to country. Whereas, for example, Malawi and Nigeria, at the time of writing, had each conducted seven waves, Armenia had only conducted one. Further, within these waves, some countries have consistently asked all four dimensions of food insecurity, whereas others have either only asked a subset, or have not asked the same questions consistently across waves.\n\nEstimation strategy\n\nWe use a fixed-effects linear probability model (Equation 1) to investigate the socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity during the pandemic for each country using household-level data over multiple waves for each of the food insecurity questions:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} y_{it} = \\delta X_{it} + \\phi Z_{it} + \\theta C_{it} + \\alpha _{i} + \\gamma _{t} + \\epsilon _{it} \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \\( y_{it}\\) is a binary outcome for household i in wave t in response to a specific food insecurity related question. \\(\\delta X_{it}\\) is a vector of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as education and gender, loss of household income compared to pre-pandemic levels/poverty status of households in the case of Chad, Djibouti, and Mali (income data are not available for these countries). In terms of safety nets, we control for whether a household has received cash or food benefits and, where this breakdown is unavailable, we control for whether a household has benefited from any safety net (\\(\\phi Z_{it}\\) is a vector of safety nets). To investigate whether the impact of safety nets on the probability of households suffering from food insecurity varies over time, interaction terms between the safety net variables and wave dummies are included. Because affordability of food is likely to be a strong determinant of food security, we include an additional dummy variable indicating whether the prices of major food items increased during the pandemic. We include two interaction terms; (1) increase in price and loss in income, and (2) increase in price and poverty status, to investigate whether increases in prices of major food items have a differential impact on food insecurity. \\(\\theta C_{it}\\) is a vector controlling for coping strategies that households have adopted during the pandemic: reliance on savings; and borrowing from friends, family, non-government organisations. Finally, we include sub-national and wave fixed-effects to control for unobserved heterogeneities (such as seasonality) across space and time. We use the sampling weights reported in the surveys.\n\nGovernment restrictions and consequent disruptions\n\nThe Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) reports stringency of governments’ policies and interventions to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Such measures might variously include school closures, travel restrictions, bans on public gatherings, emergency investments in healthcare facilities, new forms of social welfare provision, contact tracing and other interventions, and augmentation of health systems10. The index of stringency of these measures during the time period that the surveys in this paper were conducted is presented in Fig. 1. A clear pattern emerges. All 11 countries included in this paper rapidly transitioned from no restrictions at the start of 2020 to very high levels of restrictions by April 2020. Though stringency measures started to be relaxed from May 2020, most of the countries continued to impose considerable restrictions throughout the time period in consideration. Government stringency measures likely affected food security through a number of different channels, including loss of income where household members could not go to work20; and increasing food prices due to disruption of supply chains21, both of which we control for in our econometric analysis. The OxCGRT index is only available at the country-level, and not at the sub-national level. However, we control for sub-national heterogeneity in government restrictions by including regional fixed-effects and the changes in the stringency measures through the wave fixed-effects.\n\nFood insecurity and safety nets during the pandemic\n\nThe data from the multiple waves demonstrate how food insecurity has evolved during the pandemic. We present key descriptive statistics for each of the countries (Fig. 2). Some countries with multiple waves of data reveal clear trends across time. For example, in Nigeria and Uganda, across multiple dimensions, food security appears to be improving over time. In contrast, in Malawi, South Africa, and Chad, there is no clear pattern of improvement. These national level data hide sub-national trends, the richness of which are revealed in the country maps (Figures 3–10 in the Appendix).\n\nWhilst most countries report whether assistance is cash or food, two, Kenya and Armenia, only report government assistance in general terms, and some countries report three different categories of assistance. These discrepancies not withstanding, the data show that the extent and nature of the government safety nets varies considerably across countries (Fig. 3). Some countries, such as Ethiopia, have provided the majority of their population with either cash or food assistance. In other countries, such as Malawi, few households have received any type of government assistance. It should be noted that Chad and Mali have relatively low coverage of safety nets, this may be a government failure or it may be the case that coverage of safety nets is not being tracked. In the next section we undertake a series of econometric analyses to determine the extent to which these safety nets, in addition to other key variables, may have influenced how food insecurity has evolved during the pandemic.\n\nDeterminants of food insecurity\n\nThe econometric results are consistent across the four indicators of food insecurity (panels (a)–(d) in Fig. 4 and Tables 2, 3, 4, 5). Our results show that female-led households generally have a higher chance of food insecurity compared to male-led households. This effect is particularly pronounced in Malawi (for example, skipping a meal: 0.284, 95% CI 0.270, 0.299; going hungry: 0.541, 95% CI 0.516, 0.569). However, there are two exceptions: In Cambodia, having a female head reduces the probabilities of households going without eating for a whole day (panel (b); Fig. 4) and going hungry (panel (d); Fig. 4); and Chad, running out of food (panel (c); Fig. 4) and going hungry (panel (d); Fig. 4). The findings also suggest that households with relatively higher educated heads have a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity, suggesting that education continues to play an important role even during a pandemic. The influence of education varies considerably, with the highest benefits with respect to reducing the chances of being “hungry but did not eat” in Djibouti (− 0.232, 95% CI − 0.221, − 0.244), Ethiopia (− 0.156, 95% CI − 0.148, − 0.164), and Nigeria (− 0.156, 95% CI − 0.149, − 0.164); and the lowest in Malawi (− 0.006, 95% CI − 0.005, − 0.007).\n\nFood security is heavily influenced by a household’s ability to afford food. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the households experienced a loss in income, while prices of major food items have increased due to supply side constraints1,2. Our findings show that both these changes have increased households’ probability of suffering from food insecurity. The income effect is particularly strong in Cambodia (highest increase for the probability of “going without eating for a whole day”: 0.589, 95% CI 0.561, 0.619), Malawi (highest increase for the probability of “skipping a meal”: 0.274, 95% CI 0.260, 0.289), and Uganda (highest increase for the probability of “going without eating for a whole day”: 0.356, 95% CI 0.339, 0.374). For Chad, Djibouti, and Mali, we have poverty status of households rather than income information. For this group of countries, poverty status has the highest impact on the chances of being “hungry but did not eat” in Mali (0.382, 95% CI 0.364, 0.402), and the lowest in Malawi (0.135, 95% CI 0.129, 0.142). As would be expected, relatively poorer households have higher chances of suffering from food insecurity.\n\nAccording to our results, increases in prices of major food items have significantly affected food security among households across all 11 countries. Households in Ethiopia were particularly affected with respect to increased chance of “going hungry but did not eat” (0.327, 95% CI 0.311, 0.344); and those in Malawi with respect to increased chance of “running out food” (0.424, 95% CI 0.404, 0.444). Both interaction terms, loss of income and price increase dummy, and poverty status and price increase dummy, suggest that households who suffered income loss and relatively poorer households experienced relatively higher increases in the probability of food insecurity due to increases in prices of major food items (the highest effect is found in Mali in terms of increasing the chances of “going hungry but did not eat”: 0.447, 95% CI 0.426, 0.470). Though expected, these findings provide empirical evidence that increases in the prices of food items have a disproportionately higher impact on poorer households.\n\nIn terms of coping strategies, our findings show that households that were able to draw down on savings during the pandemic had a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity. Savings were more effective in reducing the probability of “skipping a meal” in Mali (− 0.327, 95% CI − 0.310, − 0.343), even controlling for poverty status of the households, than in other countries. In contrast, households that had to borrow (whether from friends or family or other sources) had a higher chance of experiencing food insecurity. These findings have implications for inequality and distributional impacts of the pandemic, as relatively higher income households are likely to have sufficient savings while poorer households are are likely have to borrow to make ends meet.\n\nDifferential impacts of safety nets\n\nOur findings indicate that cash transfers have been more effective than food transfers in reducing the probability of food insecurity during the pandemic (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8). The interaction terms between the safety net dummy variables and wave dummies further suggest that the efficacy of cash transfers improved during the pandemic. For households who received food as a safety net, however, though their probability of suffering from food insecurity also declined, across all countries with relevant data, it remained positive. For Kenya, where we do not have separate information on whether assistance is in the form of cash or food transfers, the results suggest that while safety nets were ineffective in the first wave, they did reduce the probability of food insecurity among household in the second and the third waves (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8 and Tables 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nThe lower-income countries addressed in this paper have been affected by, and responded to, the COVID-19 pandemic in different and varied ways. However, a number of common patterns emerge from the data that enable us to make several important contributions to the literature addressing food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and food insecurity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) more broadly. First, we have conducted the first multi-country, multi-time period analysis of the key factors influencing food insecurity during the pandemic. Across 11 countries and up to seven waves of data, we show how a combination of the direct health impacts of the pandemic and government responses restricting movement and trade have resulted in food insecurity that government safety nets have not fully mitigated. Our econometric analysis identifies key socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity during the pandemic. Importantly, we quantify these effects and demonstrate heterogeneity across countries and across food insecurity indicators, highlighting the importance of understanding local contexts. Specifically, households that are female-headed, less-educated, poor or experiencing a pandemic-induced loss of income, or without access to savings are more likely to suffer from food insecurity. These findings are consistent with much of the literature on the socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity22; and with23 who highlight key socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 related mortality. Because the educational background of parents influences their children’s educational, earnings, and wage outcomes24,25, our results further suggest that public investment and policies to improve education are likely to reduce inter-generational inequalities with respect food insecurity during any future crises, including possible future pandemics.\n\nSecond, we also show the differentiated impacts of household coping strategies—specifically savings versus borrowing. Our findings show that households that were able to rely on savings had a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity during the pandemic compared to the households that had to borrow, even controlling for poverty or loss of income. This finding is consistent with the literature that suggests that encouraging lower-income households to save will improve food security for the poor, not just in the context of the pandemic, and can build resilience to shocks and mitigate the more severe negative impacts of those shocks26,27,28. Third, our analysis confirms that the observed increases in the prices of major food items have increased the chances of food insecurity across countries, particularly for relatively poorer households and those that have suffered a loss in income.\n\nFinally, and importantly, our differentiated analysis of the efficacy of safety nets over time and across multiple countries demonstrates definitively that during this pandemic, cash assistance has reduced the chances of households suffering from food insecurity over time, whereas food assistance has failed to significantly reduce the probability of food insecurity during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, cash and food assistance have both been shown more broadly to improve food security across various dimensions. However, we recognise that there are other elements of food security, such as nutritional aspects and diet diversity, that we do not address, and that may not be influenced by cash transfers29. Many countries (such as Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, and South Africa) extended cash support using pre-pandemic information on vulnerability based on poverty status during the pandemic30. Our results support governments designing more targeted policies that take into account local contexts and location specific socioeconomic drivers of food insecurity; and targeting of particularly vulnerable groups including those who may be considered newly vulnerable due to shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, a number of countries have expanded cash transfers in a more targeted way, such as to the elderly (Cabo Verde, Mauritania), the disabled (Mauritania and Tunisia), and female-headed households (Mauritania). Further, countries including Madagascar and Sudan provided food assistance specifically to those who relied on daily earning who are particularly affected by government lockdown measures31. Combining these country specific targeted initiatives with our paper’s empirical findings offers guidance for governments as to how to ensure more effective food security outcomes from limited budgets.\n\nOur paper, one of the most comprehensive pieces of research to address food insecurity quantitatively across multiple countries and timescales, has revealed important empirical regularities of relevance to those responsible for improving food and nutrition status in households across lower-income countries. Our research supports the need for appropriately targeted safety nets, designed with an understanding of the specific country and household characteristics, and a broad understanding of food security that takes into account the importance of quality and nutritional content, in addition to quantity.\n\nWe recognise that though the data sets we use for our analysis are nationally representative, they are not directly comparable across countries and time, for example, in terms of the number of waves conducted, nor do they control for any potential seasonality effects. That said, we do control for the wave fixed-effects, and so do pick up seasonality aspects through the time fixed-effects. Furthermore, we do not run a pooled regression, instead the econometric analysis is conducted separately for each country, and therefore the risk of seasonality affecting our results is minimal.\n\nThese important debates over how to best reduce food insecurity tend to flare up during crises, such as pandemics, but are increasingly relevant more broadly given the persistence of food insecurity across LMICs and growing evidence that climate change is resulting in an increase in the number and proportion of under-nourished people across the globe32. As evidence increases that climate change is directly harming food security, government policies will be central to how countries adapt to the realities of climate change, particularly in terms of the likely increases in frequency and severity of shocks, on top of the slow-burn impact of increasing temperatures on crop yields.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01080-0', 'Headline': 'Effect of COVID-19 on agricultural production and food ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease impacted economies throughout the world, disproportionately impacting individuals who were already susceptible to poverty and hunger (Laborde et al ...', 'Full_text': 'The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created an unusual situation globally (Alam and Khatun, 2021). Barely a year ago early in the year 2020, the unusual nature of coronavirus caused most governments to implement stringent steps in their countries to restrain the virus’s spread. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease impacted economies throughout the world, disproportionately impacting individuals who were already susceptible to poverty and hunger (Laborde et al., 2020a; Ceballos et al., 2020). In late December 2019, the virus was discovered in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 presented a major danger to human health, the economy, and food security in both industrialised and emerging nations (Mottaleb et al., 2020; Carroll et al., 2020; Alam and Khatun, 2021). Lessons learned from China revealed that various COVID-19 countermeasures such as lockdown in the country hampered production. This poses a significant risk to the long-term food supply (FAO, 2020), and has a negative impact on the economy, resulting in economic decline and crisis (Bai, 2020). It is important to understand that certain precautional and control efforts compromise agricultural production (Singh et al., 2021).\n\nThe virus wreaked havoc on the agricultural production sector, which is at the heart of the food chain (Pu and Zhong, 2020). The global spread of coronavirus resulted in the greatest economic downturn since World War Two (Hanna et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021). The epidemic’s major impact on agricultural labour input was the restriction of labour mobility. Farmers were not permitted to just go out and gather in any way except to purchase essentials. This resulted in a manpower scarcity and reduced mass production efficiency. For instance, due to a scarcity of migrant experts, producers from Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei in the grain-producing districts in China (south-eastern coastal district) were not able to sow their crops in good time (Pu and Zhong, 2020). Furthermore, wheat and pulse harvesting in northwest India was hampered due to a lack of migrant labour (Dev, 2020). Vegetable farmers in Ethiopia incurred not just financial loss as a result of overstocked items, but also from a lack of vital inputs (Tamru et al., 2020). Before the pandemic, suppliers may have planted six hectares in a single day, but due to the difficulties in finding tractor drivers during the pandemic, they were only able to cover three hectares a day (Pu and Zhong, 2020). Any interruptions in agricultural food supply will indeed result in supply and demand shocks, which will have an immediate effect on the agricultural sector of the economy with long-term economic performance and food security implications (Gregorio and Ancog, 2020).\n\nFood security refers to a situation where all individuals at all time have continuous physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to fulfil their dietary needs and food choices for an active and healthy lifestyle (Elsahoryi et al., 2020). Food security has been jeopardised both directly and indirectly as a result of the virus’s destabilisation of food systems and the effects of lockdowns on family revenue and physical access to food (Devereux et al., 2020). The presence of coronavirus disease has a negative impact on all the four pillars of food security, viz. availability of food, accessibility of food, utilisation of food, and stability of food (Nechifor et al., 2021; Laborde et al., 2020b). According to Genkin and Mikheev (2020), the report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Trade Organization, and World Health Organization (WHO) note the threat of a food catastrophe triggered by the current coronavirus pandemic, with a risk of a global “food shortage” owing to interruptions in the trade industry’s supply chain. According to the report, global commerce contracted by roughly 20% in 2020, with 90–120 million human beings falling into severe destitution and over 300 million facing food security issues in emerging nations. To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, world leaders implemented steps to decrease the number of commodities carried by sea, air and land, as well as labour migration at national and global levels. These variables contributed to a widespread disturbance in agricultural output and food distribution systems, posing challenges to the transportation of food and agricultural resources (Genkin and Mikheev, 2020).\n\nPresent literature centred on the effect of coronavirus on food security or effect of coronavirus on agricultural production (Elsahoryi et al., 2020; Nchanji and Lutomia, 2021). Despite the growing body of research on coronavirus, agricultural production, and food security, few studies have attempted to conduct a thorough assessment of the literature and map the present level of scientific knowledge on the effect of coronavirus on agricultural production and food security (ECAP-FS). Hence, the goal of this research was to examine the effect of coronavirus on agricultural production and food security by employing bibliometric analyses techniques to recognise keywords in connection to two core aspects, namely the most prolific or productive writers and the most collaborative nations, and then to examine the strength of their association over the study period. The study characterised intellectual processes further by visualising and recognising the advancement of the co-citation network, cooperation network, and trends in ECAP-FS research. This research will not only aid in the identification of present research on ECAP-FS, but also contributes to an improved comprehension of the scientific knowledge of coronavirus and its impact on agricultural production, food security, and the investigation of its evolution via published papers included in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. Because one database is unlikely to provide a comprehensive picture of knowledge and trends in a field, the authors recommend a four stage processes to achieve a merged database that integrates WoS and Scopus and then deletes identical publications using RStudio or R-package to perform author coupling, keywords co-occurrence network visualisation, university collaboration networks, and others using net2VOSviewer. This study will be among the few that explains how to integrate two datasets and utilise them to conduct different network associations in bibliometrix R-package (RStudio v.4.0.3 software).\n\nThe scientometric technique was used to retrieve articles relating to the effect of coronavirus on agricultural production and food security. This method used resources from two different databases, WoS and Scopus, for the systematic reviews. Table 1 shows the eligibility and exclusion criteria that was used to access the relevant documents. The various steps employed in the review process were (databases, identification, screening, eligibility, merging, duplicate removal and included documents) (see Fig. 1). Processing and analysis of the data were then applied to the remaining documents. Scientometrics is defined as the research approach utilised in analysing and assessing science, innovation, and technology by applying statistics and quantitative analysis to explain the distribution and visualisation patterns of research within a specific nation, issue, field or institution (Orimoloye and Ololade, 2021). Scientometric evaluations have been used to analyse scientific trends and outputs, as well as the evolution of research, author productivity, journals, and nations, as well as to discover and measure international collaboration (Orimoloye and Ololade, 2021).\n\nResources\n\nWoS and Scopus were the two-database used for this study. WoS is a database collection administered by Thomson Reuters Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) that contains databases on humanities, social sciences, biology (i.e., Biosis), science (i.e., Core Collection) and computers (i.e., Inspec). WoS was previously the only and biggest accessible database for bibliometric analysis. However, Scopus that was launched by Elsevier, with ease of use in universities throughout the globe emerged as a key rival for doing such studies (Echchakoui, 2020). Scopus has the largest abstract and citation databases with over 22,800 journals from 5000 publishers worldwide was used in the review (Shaffril et al., 2018). Moreover, It is the most comprehensive interdisciplinary database of peer-reviewed literature in the social sciences, and is generally acknowledged and utilised for quantitative analyses (Guerrero-Baena et al., 2014).\n\nCriteria for eligibility and exclusion\n\nVarious qualifying and exclusion criteria were considered. Title-based search for rapid visibility and retrieval was used. According to Ekundayo and Okoh (2018), a title-specific search offers the advantages of low loss, considerable retrieval, and sensitivity when compared to other types of searches such as a topic, field, or author search. First, concerning literature type, only journals and final articles were selected, which meant Article in Press, etc., were excluded. Secondly, non-English articles were excluded. Thirdly, a period of 6 years was used followed by the subject area, which focused on Environmental, Social, Agricultural, and Biological Sciences (Table 1) (Shaffril et al., 2018).\n\nSystematic review process\n\nTo explore the current literature on ECAP-FS, we conducted a comprehensive literature review according to the rules provided by Tranfield et al. (2003). The systematic review process for this study involved four stages. The review process was performed in April 2021. The first stage was the selection of databases (WoS and Scopus). The second stage pinpointed keywords utilised for the search process. Based on prior research, keywords similar and related to the effect of COVID-19 on agricultural output and food security were used with a total of (n = 9, 421) published records found on WoS and Scopus, respectively (Table 2). The third stage was screening. Out of (n = 9, 421) papers eligible for evaluation at this stage, a total of (n = 7, 203) papers were excluded. The fourth stage was eligibility where the complete articles were accessible. Following a thorough review, a total of (n = 1, 46) publications were eliminated since some did not focus on the effect of coronavirus on agricultural production and food security. The fifth stage was merging the two documents (n = 6, 172 = 178). The sixth stage was the removal of duplicates (n = 4). The last round of evaluation yielded a total of (n = 174) papers for qualitative analysis (Fig. 1).\n\nProcessing and analysis of data\n\nThe research assessed data obtained for scientometric investigation utilising RStudio v.4.0.3 software with bibliometrix R-package and net2VOSviewer after reading the articles relevant to the study. The data were imported into RStudio, transformed to a bibliographic data frame, and normalised for duplicate matches (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017; Ekundayo and Okoh, 2018). Net2VOSviewer (net,vos.path = NULL) embedded in RStudio v.4.0.3 software were used for visualisation. The VOSviewer programme created by Van Eck and Waltman (2009) is often used to visualise and evaluate a bibliometric network. Hamidah et al. (2021) and Zhang and Yuan (2019) made use of VOSviewer to analyse a bibliographic map on energy performance. Park and Nagy (2018) used VOSviewer to examine building control bibliographic data, and Van Eck and Waltman (2017) analysed citation-based clustering in the field of astronomy and astrophysics using VOSviewer. The research made use of Net2VOSviewer embedded in R studio to make visualisation maps, such as authors coupling, keyword co-occurrence network, and university collaboration network, based on bibliographic data. Each circle on the VOSviewer visual map represents a word. The term activity is represented by the circle and text size. The big circle and text show the chosen terms in a field. The distance between the two words reflects the degree of their association. In this case, the relationship between two words will be greater if the distance between them is small (Hamidah et al., 2021).\n\nWeb of Science and Scopus database merging for bibliometric analysis\n\nThe authors suggest the following four stage approach to combine the two databases shown in Fig. 1 and Table 3.\n\nAs soon as required articles were sourced, we downloaded the documents separately from WoS and Scopus databases. For WoS, we clicked on export, which redirected us to another window where we selected “other file formats” under record content, and “BiTeX” under file format before we clicked export. For Scopus, we went to export document setting where we ticked all relevant boxes including “BibTeX” before clicking export. The second step was to transform (WoS.bib and Scopus.bib) to “bibtex” files. Here we used R or Rstudio software by loading the bibliometrix package “install.packages” (“bibliometrix”), and “library(bibliometrix)”, After that we specified the pathway using the command file1<- “path/savedrecs.bib” and file2 < - “path/scopus.bib” for WoS and Scopus files, respectively. After that we converted file (1&2) using command “f1<-convert2df(file1, dbsource = “isi”, format = “bibtex”)” and “f2<-convert2df(file2, dbsource = “scopus”, format = “bibtex”)” for WoS and Scopus respectively. We merged the two databases in R/Rstudio. For this operation to be successful, we used the command “j <-mergeDbSources(f1, f2, remove.duplicated = FALSE)”. Finally, the duplicate documents were removed using the command “M < -duplicatedMatching(j, Field = “TI”,tol = 0.95)”. We performed a bibliometric analysis for bibtex file in Rstudio, using Aria and Cuccurullo’s (2017) techniques and scripts in R, and utilising the net2VOSviewer for keywords co-occurrence network, collaboration networks of universities, authors coupling, amongst others.\n\nBibliometric analyses results\n\nDuring the survey period, 174 papers were published on ECAP-FS; their characteristics are shown in Table 4. The research had 851 authors, with a cooperation index of 5.1 and a document/author ratio of 0.20 (4.89 authors/document). Except for nine authors who published alone, all 842 authors were part of multi-author publications.\n\nDuring the research period, an average of 6.0 citations per document were recorded. Lotka’s law scientific output for ECAP-FS study revealed a constant of 0.70 and beta coefficient of 3.88, with a Kolmogorov–Smirnoff goodness-of-fit of 0.94. Table 5 and Fig. 2 displays published research on ECAP-FS from 2016 to April 2021 in conjunction with the total citation of papers on average by year. The yearly pace of development was 56.64, with a mean overall of 12 ± 6, indicating that ECAP-FS research increased over time. This outcome agrees with the work of El Mohadebe et al. (2020) who stated that the number of published articles increased exponentially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise in COVID-19 research reflects that it is a major danger to human health, the economy, and food security in industrialised and emerging nations (Carroll et al., 2020; Mottaleb et al., 2020; Alam and Khatun, 2021).\n\nDuring the survey period, research production varied, peaking in 2020 with 38.5% (67/174) of the total research output, followed by 2021 with 66 research articles accounting for 37.9% (66/174) during the same time. This result is liable to change when additional papers pertaining to ECAP-FS are published in 2021. The average total number of citations for published papers changed over time, peaking in 2016 (average = 11.8). Furthermore, the findings of this analysis identified the top 20 most prolific authors from 2016 to April 2021. Table 6 shows Gong B as the most productive author over the time, with six papers accounting for 3.45% of the total research publications on ECAP-FS. The following were placed second on the list: Baudron F, Peng W, and Zhang S who published three research articles each accounting for 1.7% of the total published research articles within the study period. The rest of the 17 authors published two articles within the same year. The quantity of a researcher’s academic output demonstrates their efficacy and propensity for conducting quality research (Orimoloye et al., 2021a)\n\nCitation analysis reveals how many times a specific research article has been cited in other scientific articles. More cited research articles are considered significantly more influential than articles with fewer citations (Mishra et al., 2017; Nyam et al., 2020). Table 7 shows the top 20 papers on ECAP-FS in terms of citations in the field throughout the time. The list was compiled using the publications with the most citations (Echchakoui, 2020). In this research on ECAP-FS, Foyer et al. 2016 “Nature Plants” placed first with a total of 244 citations. Hart et al. 2018 “Functional Ecology” took second place with 60 citations, followed by Smiraglia D. 2016 “Environmental Research” with 52 citations during the same time period. Millar NS 2016 “Oecologia” and Tesfahunegn GB 2016 “Applied Geography” rated fourth and fifth with 43 and 42 citations, respectively. With 39, 23 and 21 citations, respectively, KC et al. 2018 “Plos One,” Pu and Zhong, 2020 “Global Food Security,” and Provenza FD 2019 “Frontiers in Nutrition” placed sixth, seventh, and eighth. As shown in Table 8, the leading active writers were connected with institutions in both emerging and developed countries, including China (28), the United States (19), the United Kingdom (12), Italy (9), Spain (8), Australia (5), India (5), and Mexico (5). With the exception of China, the majority of the articles were from developed countries. China, the United States of America, United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, among other countries, contributed the most articles in ECAP-FS, which is line with the work of Mottaleb et al. (2020). According to Orimoloye et al. (2021b), research funding and scholarships have had a significant impact on the research output of many countries. As a result, this study indicates that economic assistance could help in the advancement of research in the area of ECAP-FS. Furthermore, during the research period, the total citation of published papers on average by each nation differed from one nation to another. Table 9 shows the top 20 citations by nation for ECAP-FS research papers. The data indicated that the most mentioned nations were industrialised ones, while China, a developing country, placed second among the most often referenced nations. The exceptional success of China research suggests that the nation performs well in sponsoring field research, possibly because the coronavirus originated in Wuhan City of China (Mottalab et al., 2020). Italy leads the way with 112 total citations and an average article citation of 12.44 for research papers published during the study duration, China was second with 107 citations and an average article citation of 3.82. During the same time period, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ethiopia, and Canada were placed third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, with total number of citations (average article citations) of 81 (4.26), 76 (6.33), 47 (23.50), and 40 (13.33), respectively.\n\nThis analysis also uncovered the most relevant sources for published academic research on ECAP-FS between 2016 and April 2021, as shown in Table 10. Sustainability (Switzerland) was first with a total of 23 scientific papers on ECAP-FS. Agricultural Systems and Journal of Cleaner Production were ranked second and third with a total of 13 and 10 articles respectively. Global Food Security and Science of The Total Environment were rated fourth with eight articles each. Land was ranked fifth with five articles while Food Security, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Plos One were ranked sixth with four published articles each. Environmental Research and Journal of Integrative Agriculture rated seventh with three published articles on ECAP-FS throughout the review period.\n\nConcerns are growing about the influence of COVID-19 on agricultural production, which could pose a significant threat to long-term food security and food supply (Pu and Zhong, 2020). Table 11 summarises the top 20 academics’ most relevant terms. In addition, Table 11 displays the most important keywords linked to ECAP-FS research, including keywords-plus (ID) as well as author keywords (DE). COVID-19, Food Security, Agriculture, Climate Change, Sustainable Development, Agricultural Production, Biodiversity, China, and Sustainability were among the nine keywords shared by keywords-plus (ID) and author keywords (DE). Eleven keywords were peculiar to authors’ keywords (Resilience, Ecosystem Services, Food Systems, COVID-19 Pandemic, Food Supply Chain, India, Land Take, Life Cycle Assessment, Nutrition, Conservation, and Dietary Diversity), and nine keywords were unique to keywords-Plus (Food Supply, Human, Article, Food Production, Land Use, Agricultural Robots, Agricultural Land, Controlled Study, and Cultivation). The distinct author keywords explicitly defined what COVID-19 affected as well as the means or elements engaged in the process (Nutrition, Dietary Diversity, Ecosystem Services, Resilience, Conservation, Food Systems, and Food Supply Chain of People). COVID-19 (n = 27, 15.5%), Food Security (n = 25, 14.4%), Agriculture (n = 18, 10.3%), Climate Change (n = 9, 5.2%), Sustainable Development (n = 5, 2.9%), Agricultural Production (n = 4, 2.3%), Biodiversity (n = 4, 2.3%), China (n = 4, 2.3%), COVID-19 Pandemic (n = 4, 2.3%) were author keyword phrases related with the detection of ECAP-FS.\n\nThe keyword analysis identified Food Security in 35 (20.1%) and 25 (14.4%) published papers by keyword-plus and author keyword, respectively, while Agricultural was found in 28 (16.1%) and 18 (10.3%) published papers by keyword-plus and author keyword, respectively. By author keyword and keyword-plus, Agricultural Production was detected in 4 (2.3%) and 28 (16.1%) publications, respectively. In the ECAP-FS study field, Climate Change was detected in 26 (14.9%) and 9 (5.2%) papers by keyword-plus and author keyword, respectively. The review indicates that research on ECAP-FS emphasised these agricultural-related issues several times, implying that COVID-19 has an effect on agriculture, agricultural production, sustainable development, food security, and food supply of the general public, which is exacerbated by climate change, and is a major danger to food security, economy and human health (Mottaleb et al., 2020).\n\nThe connection between influential authors, keywords, journals, and trending topics was investigated using co-citation network analysis (Leydesdorff, 2009). Articles are said to be co-cited when they are cited and appear in other publications’ reference lists (Nyam et al., 2020). The top 20 authors coupling in Fig. 3 explains the authors coupling on ECAP-FS-related research. Every node in the network symbolises a distinct author who is linked to others. Connecting lines reflect author-to-author linking routes. The number of lines from each node correlates to the number of published papers that referenced the writer. The cluster of authors network, which comprises 20 nodes (authors), has no less than 18 interconnections. Other indicators of often expressed ideas and frameworks linked to ECAP-FS include nation collaboration (Fig. 4) and university collaboration network (Fig. 5).\n\nAuthors with multiple affiliations have made significant contributions to nation and university collaborative networks (Figs. 4 and 5). Our findings indicated that studies on ECAP-FS were conducted at institutions in both advanced and developing nations between 2016 and April 2021. The Wageningen University (Netherland), the China Agricultural University (China), the Zhejiang University (Asia), and University of Pretoria (South Africa) had the greatest collaboration network on ECAP-FS studies followed by the University of Western Australia (Australia), University of Leeds (UK), University of Alberta (Canada), University of Sydney (Australia), Case Western Reserve University (USA), Chinese University of Hong Kong (China) and the International Crop Research Institute. The University of Oxford was the only university that did not collaborate with any of the universities during the study period. Figure 4 depicts the networks of collaboration on ECAP-FS for 27 countries. The number of collaboration paths varied from one to 17. The number of partnerships was highest in the USA (n = 17), followed by China (n = 10), Australia (n = 8), the United Kingdom (n = 8), Canada (n = 5), the Netherlands (n = 4), Germany (n = 4), South Africa (n = 4), Uganda (n = 3), India (n = 3), Malaysia (n = 2), Denmark (n = 2), France (n = 2), Spain (n = 2), and New Zealand (n = 2). The remaining nations had one collaboration network. This outcome is consistent with El Mohadab et al. (2020) as the analysis of a nation’s collaboration is a vital type of analysis, because it allows for the visualisation of the most influential nations in a given field of research, revealing the level of scientific cooperation between the countries. The following network colour codes were prominent: light green for the USA network; light blue for the China network; purple for the Australia network; orange for the United Kingdom network; and brown for the Spain network.\n\nFigure 6 depicts the top 30 keywords of co-occurrence network, the related visualisation and the association strength of ECAP-FS. The co-occurrence of author keywords was examined to illustrate the research hotspots in ECAP-FS. The threshold for keyword co-occurrence was set at 10, and 30 keywords out of 708 were categorised as visualisation elements. The distance between the components of each pairings indicated topic similarity and relative strength. Individual term clusters were allocated different colours of circles. The network in Fig. 6 depicts three different clusters, each reflecting a branch of research in the ECAP-FS literature. The number of publications in which the keywords co-occurred was shown by the connections between specific keywords. The main themes with the highest overall connection strength in the ECAP-FS literature were COVID-19, Food Security, Agriculture, and Climate Change.\n\nThe ECAP-FS scientific field has three subfields (clusters of author keywords), which are as follows:\n\nThe blue cluster includes terms such as COVID-19, Food Supply, Food Production, China, Food Security, and Agricultural Production.’\n\nThe red cluster grouped the keywords Agricultural Land, Catering Services, Environmental Protection, Humans, Meat, Human, Food Industry, Article, Female, Priority Journal, Procedures, Controlled Study, and Environmental Sustainability.\n\nThe green cluster grouped the keywords Economic and Social Effects, Agriculture, Agricultural Robots, Sustainable Development, Climate Change, Land Use, Greenhouse Gases, Ecosystem, and Biodiversity. The findings revealed a significant variation in the co-occurrence of author keywords in individual articles in the ECAP-FS literature. This demonstrated the scientific field’s multifaceted and multidimensional nature. This result is agreement with the work of Orimoloye et al. (2021b).\n\nFigure 7 depicts the frequency of word occurrence of the top 70 most utilised title keywords in ECAP-FS studies. During the research, a word cloud was generated using the titles of published articles that contained the most frequently used keywords in ECAP-FS research. This revealed the most commonly used word or phrase in ECAP-FS research. Within the word cloud on ECAP-FS research, various regions of connections and the most significant words used were determined. For example, COVID-19, food security, agriculture, climate change, ecosystem services, resilience, agricultural production, sustainable development, food system, and China were recognised as the most prevalent or prominent themes in ECAP-FS studies.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311886.2022.2064608', 'Headline': 'Full article: Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security and ...', 'Snippet': 'Beyond its impact on health, COVID-19 has caused significant changes and affected all aspects of present-day society. ...

The pandemic has led to governments across the world implementing social distancing measures and restrictions on movement and work, generally referred to as “lockdowns”, at various stages during the pandemic in an attempt to contain viral spread [1]. The associated impact of putting the brakes on economic activity has had a profound effect on economic growth. Global economic growth in 2020 was 4.9% lower than in 2019 and it is projected that global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2021 will be 6.5% lower than pre-Covid-19 projections made in January 2020 [2]. These huge macro-level economic changes in the role of the state in economic decision making such as which businesses can operate associated with containment measures to reduce the spread of the virus as well as risks from the virus have had significant impacts on individual behaviour and both health and social outcomes.\n\nIn the UK, the fear and uncertainty associated with Covid-19 led to a change in consumer spending in the first three weeks of March 2020 leading up to the first national lockdown [3,4,5]. There were large increases in consumer spending on food staples such as canned goods, dried pasta, flour, and soup [5]. As a result of unanticipated increase in demand in late February and early March 2020, by the start of the first UK national lockdown, 40% of people had difficulty accessing the basic food they required at supermarkets [6]. Thus, the number of people reporting being food insecure quadrupled in March 2020 in the UK [6]. Here, the term food insecurity relates to both physical and economic access to food. For a person to be considered food secure they need to have sufficient quantities of food available on a consistent basis, adequate income or resources available to access appropriate food, and adequate food must be available at all times with access to and availability of food not curtailed by acute or recurring emergencies [7]. This definition excludes the use of food aid such as food banks. People may use food banks because they are food insecure or at risk of food insecurity. However, not everyone who is unable to access healthy and nutritious food or has insufficient quantities of food may utilise food aid, hence usage of aid is likely to underrepresent need.\n\nIn 2015, all United Nation (UN) member states signed up to achieving the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) by 2030 [8]. UNSDG 2 is zero hunger; aiming to eliminate food insecurity by 2030. Before the pandemic, in 2016, it was estimated that approximately 8.4 million households in the UK were food insecure [9]. In 2019, the Government’s voluntary review on progress towards achieving SDG 2 identified that the UK was making insufficient progress to achieve zero hunger by 2030. Increases in food insecurity are likely to be a driving factor in the dramatic rise in the demand for food aid such as food banks in the UK. There were an estimated 65 foodbanks in the UK in 2011 which grew to over 1,200 in 2019 [10]. This demonstrates that even before the arrival Covid-19, the UK was significantly lagging behind in its aim to reduce food insecurity.\n\nThere is currently a lack of UK quantitative data available on the determinants of food insecurity in the UK. However, a report commissioned by the foodbank charity the Trussell Trust [10], found the following risk factors for being food insecure in the UK before the Covid-19 pandemic: low income, single parent household, being of working age, living alone, renting one’s home, being unemployed, and living in a household affected by poor health. Poverty is strongly associated with food insecurity, however not all households that are food insecure are in poverty and not all households in poverty are food insecure [11].\n\nIn the first year of the pandemic in 2020, the UK Government implemented a range of support measures in an attempt to mitigate the associated economic consequences. These support measures—which have been revised as the pandemic has progressed—included a self-employed income support scheme, a job retention scheme – through which the Government helped to pay part of the salary of ‘furloughed’ employees—a freezing of business rates, a grant scheme for small businesses, and business interruption loans [12]. From the 6th April 2020, two of the most important state welfare benefits -tax credits and universal credit- increased by £20 a week for one year to help low-income households [13]. For children eligible for free school meals, the government created a £15 weekly food voucher scheme facilitated through schools to be given to families [14]. This scheme was extended from the school term to include the summer holidays in 2020 after a successful awareness-raising campaign led by the professional footballer Marcus Rashford [15]. These measures are likely to prevent some households falling into poverty and financial strain, with potential avoidance of food insecurity.\n\nHowever, there are multiple gaps in these economic safety nets as new employees and the self-employed, those who pay themselves in dividends, those earning a mix of salary and self-employed income, freelancers, and sole traders are not eligible for support [16]. The impact of this is demonstrated by evidence indicating that only a very small minority of people actually self-isolate or quarantine appropriately in line with UK national Covid requirements; this contrasts with very high reported intentions to adhere to guidance [17]. Houston [18] found that those who were unemployed pre-Covid were more likely to remain unemployed and not find a job at the start of the pandemic. Thus, these groups are in a weakened position to deal with the associated economic fallout. There is evidence showing that women, single parents, young people (aged 16–30 years), and ethnic minorities have borne the brunt of the economic impact of the pandemic [19]. This suggests that the Covid pandemic has widened existing inequalities and may be expected to further exacerbate inequalities in future, with associated negative health and social implications.\n\nThe policy measures put in place to mitigate the economic impact of Covid-19, such as the furlough scheme [12] have predominantly supported those who were in employment before the pandemic. The protective effects of the furlough scheme on employment are demonstrated by the fact that employment in sectors unable to operate under lockdown explains only 5.7% of the increase in variation in unemployment during the Covid-19 pandemic between areas of the UK [18].\n\nWe focus on access to food and reporting being hungry as our measures of food insecurity. The Covid-19 pandemic increased supply side issues related to the availability of food because of both changes in consumer behaviour (hoarding/panic buying) [5, 6] as well as containment and quarantine measures which may have impacted on people’s access to food. Being hungry and not being able to eat may have increased for those who were financially constrained and then fell through the economic social safety net provisions in place which is why we focus on this measure. Given the nature of government support available during the Covid-19 pandemic we hypothesise that people who are more economically and medically vulnerable to Covid-19 are more likely to report being food insecure. It is likely that those who had higher likelihood of being food insecure before the pandemic such as those on low income, single parents, young people, people living in a household with someone in poor health [10] will be at increased likelihood of suffering from food insecurity during the Covid-19 pandemic because of risk factors associated with increased vulnerability to both the economic and health consequences of the virus. We hypothesise that including a range of different socioeconomic factors related to the social determinants of health such as educational attainment, household composition, current employment status, gender, age, marital status, housing tenure type, and reporting a limiting long-term condition will be associated differentially with the two measures of food insecurity, since these measures are capturing different aspects of what it means to be food insecure. For example, access to food may affect people across the socioeconomic spectrum and could be related to other factors such as rurality whereas being hungry and not eating is more likely to be associated with characteristics related to economic vulnerability. Having covid-19 symptoms may mean people need to isolate which may impact on their ability to access food. If people are not compensated for when they isolate this could impact on their ability to afford food.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to explore which economic and socioeconomic factors are associated with experiencing the two measures of food insecurity 1) access to healthy and nutritious food and 2) being hungry but not able to eat. Next, for those characteristics associated with increased likelihood of food insecurity we explore to what extent financial vulnerability and having Covid-19 symptoms explain this increased risk. We focus on symptoms rather than diagnosis because availability of Covid-19 tests changed over the pandemic period and some people may not have been able to access a test. Thus, to include all survey respondents who may have been affected by Covid we decided to include the broadest possible definition. To achieve these aims we use a national longitudinal dataset from the UK, the Understanding Society Covid Survey.\n\nData\n\nWe use data from waves 1, 4, and 5 (April, July, and September 2020) of the Understanding Society Covid Survey from the UK [20]. These are the three waves in which questions on food insecurity were asked of participants. The Covid survey is a sub- survey of approximately 17,000 households who participated in the main Understanding Society Survey, which is an annual household longitudinal survey of 40,000 households [21]. The Covid survey ran monthly from April 2020 until March 2021 with an additional antibody testing kit in April 2021 and a closing survey in summer 2021. The aim of the survey is to understand the impact of the pandemic on individuals, families, and communities. The University of Essex Ethics Committee for the COVID-19 web and telephone surveys (ETH1920-1271) granted ethical approval for the study. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.\n\nThe analysis is limited to respondents who respond to all study questions of interest in at least one wave of data collection. This gives us 9,501 observations for our first measure of food insecurity and 9499 observations for our second measure of food insecurity.\n\nMeasure of food insecurity\n\nThere is no single widely accepted definition of food insecurity [22]. To proxy for food insecurity, we focus on quantity and access to sufficient food based upon the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations definition of food insecurity [23] whereby a person is food insecure if they report either of the following:\n\n1)\n\nBeing hungry and not able to eat\n\n2)\n\nInability to access sufficient and nutritious food because of lack of money or other resources\n\nWe record these as binary variables which are equal to one if the respondent reports yes to either or both of the two questions above and equal to zero if the respondent reports no. A person might not necessarily report both measures of food insecurity. These measures of food insecurity have not been validated to date in this population. However, they can provide useful insights on factors associated with the two elements of food insecurity, namely access and affordability, which has important implications for public health.\n\nSocioeconomic factors influencing the likelihood of being food insecure\n\nThe explanatory variables used in the analysis are drawn from the wider literature identifying the determinants of food insecurity in high income countries [24,25,26] and the social determinants of health [27]. The variables we include in our models are log of equivalised household income, a binary variable which equals one if an individual owns or has a mortgage on their house and is equal to zero if they rent, binary variables for educational attainment, a binary variable for long term sick/disabled, a binary variable for being a young person between 16–30 years of age, and a binary variable for being a single parent. We control for additional demographic factors through a binary variable for being female, and binary variables for having children between ages 0–2, 3–4, 5–11, and 12–15 years.\n\nFinancial vulnerability and Covid-19 symptoms\n\nWe explore two pathways to explain the association between the identified socioeconomic factors and food insecurity. To control for financial vulnerability or the likelihood of being negatively financially impacted by containment measures to reduce the spread of the virus we include a variable on the reduction in working hours and being in debt (defined as being behind on bills). To control for Covid-19 symptoms we include a binary variable of having Covid-19 symptoms.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nTo estimate the relationship between socioeconomic factors and food insecurity, we start by estimating logistic regressions for the two measures of food insecurity. Standard errors are clustered to control for the fact that we have observations on some individuals at more than one time point. The analysis is pooled across all three waves of data.\n\nNext, for the characteristics that we identify as increasing the likelihood of being at risk for being food insecure we explore to what extent financial vulnerability and having Covid-19 symptoms explain this risk. To do this we employ a decomposition approach following Kohler, Karlson, and Holm [28]. This approach allows us to determine if there is an indirect or moderating effect of having Covid-19 symptoms and economic vulnerability on the relationship between food insecurity and sociodemographic factors. The model decomposes how much of the observed correlation between the key explanatory variable is explained by having Covid-19 symptoms and economic vulnerability and how much stems from other individual characteristics. A logit model is used to extract the residuals to be able to separate out the direct and indirect effects explaining the observed association.\n\nWe pooled the data so that the results would be consistent across our two different estimation approaches as the decomposition approach that we employ cannot account for changes over time.\n\nThe STROBE checklist for observational studies is followed and can be found in Additional file 1: Appendix A.\n\nThe descriptive statistics for the dataset covering all survey waves used in this study are presented in Table 1. Slightly over half of the sample was female (58%, n = 5510). Approximately 15% (n = 1425) of the sample was aged between 16–30 years, 5% (n = 475) of the sample were single parents. Approximately 82% (n = 7790) of the sample owned or had a mortgage on their home. Approximately 13% (n = 1235) of the sample reported someone in the household being unable to eat healthy or nutritious food but only 2% (n = 190) reported being hungry and not eating. Approximately 10% (n = 950) of the sample were furloughed, 6% (n = 570) reported having Covid-19 symptoms, and 8% (n = 760) were newly unemployed. Comparing this with the main Understanding Society Survey [29] and other national surveys [30], this sample is more affluent than the general UK population.\n\nTable 2 shows the results from the logistic regressions identifying the demographic and economic factors that are associated with an increased risk of food insecurity during the Covid-19 pandemic. Column 1 shows the results for access to healthy and nutritious food and column 2 shows the results for being hungry but not able to eat. Being a single parent is associated with 2.85 higher times of not having access to healthy and nutritious food and 3.39 higher times reporting being hungry but not able to eat. Being a young person (aged 16–30 years) compared to an older adult is associated with 4.12 times higher likelihood of reporting being hungry but not able to eat. Having no qualifications compared to any type of educational qualifications is associated with 6.96 higher times of reporting being hungry but not able to eat. Furloughed workers were associated with 2.73 higher times of reporting being hungry but not able to eat whereas there was a significant negative association with reporting having access to healthy and nutritious food. Individuals with more economic resources (owning or having a mortgage on their home and higher household income) had a significantly negative association with reporting being hungry but not able to eat. Those with children aged 12–15 years compared to those with children of other ages or not having children at all was significantly and negatively associated with reporting not having access to healthy and nutritious food.\n\nWe then explored to what extent the association we found for the two measures of food insecurity for single parents (Fig. 1) and for young people (Fig. 2) is explained by financial vulnerability and having Covid-19 symptoms employing the Kohler et al. [28] decomposition approach for non-linear variables. For single parents in Fig. 1, financial vulnerability (as defined by a reduction in working hours and being behind on bills after controlling for employment status), explained approximately 20% of the likelihood of reporting ever going hungry and 5% of lacking access to healthy and nutritious food. For single parents, having Covid-19 symptoms explained less than 5% of the likelihood of reporting the two measures of food insecurity. For young people in Fig. 2, financial vulnerability explained approximately 5% of the likelihood of reporting going hungry and 25% of the likelihood of reporting not having access to healthy and nutritious food. For this group, having Covid-19 symptoms explained less than 5% of the likelihood of going hungry but approximately 30% of the likelihood of reporting not having access to healthy and nutritious food.\n\nMain finding\n\nIn this paper, we explore socioeconomic factors associated with the two measures of food insecurity during the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK. We find that single parents compared to partnered parents or childless people and those who are furloughed compared to those who continue to work are significantly associated with reporting both measures of food insecurity. It is important to note that being furloughed was negatively associated with difficulty in accessing food but positively associated with reporting being hungry but not able to eat. Young people compared to those who are aged over 30 years and those who have no qualifications compared to those with some formal educational qualifications are significantly associated with reporting being hungry but no association with access to food was observed. We further explore to what extent financial vulnerability experienced during the pandemic can explained the increased risk of food insecurity experienced by young people and single parents. We find that financial vulnerability explains between 5 to 25% of the likelihood of reporting being food insecure for young people and single parents. These percentages are dependent upon the measure of food insecurity. Next, we estimated the impact of having Covid-19 symptoms on the likelihood of being food insecure for young people and single parents. Having Covid-19 symptoms explains less than 5% of the likelihood of being food insecure for single parents but explains approximately 30% of not having access to healthy and nutritious food for young people.\n\nWhat is already known on the topic\n\nGrowing levels of food insecurity pre-pandemic have been associated with eating cheaper and less healthy food [31]. There is a global evidence suggesting that there is an association between childhood food insecurity and obesity [32, 33] and adult obesity and food insecurity [34, 35]. If more people are pushed into food insecurity, this is likely to impact on the UK government’s ability to reach their target of reducing adult obesity and halving childhood obesity by 2030 [36] in addition to undermining its commitment to the UN SDG2 goal.\n\nThere have been two studies which are particularly relevant for analysis related to financial vulnerability and food insecurity during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. For the UK, Joyce and Xu [19] found that the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic are likely to have a larger effect on young people and women, who typically tend to work in sectors impacted by lockdowns such as hospitality and retail. Low earners and those without other working household members (e.g. single parents) are also more likely to experience a negative impact on their finances. This is consistent with our results that showed that vulnerable groups were more likely to report one or both measures of food insecurity and the financial vulnerability may be one mechanism explaining this observed association. Milovanska-Farrington [37] has shown that in the USA, unemployment was associated with increased risk for food insecurity and was there was a higher risk for those who were already unemployed at the start of the pandemic. In our analysis we do not investigate those who are unemployed but explore those who are on the furlough scheme (not working but receiving a proportion of their former salary). We found being on the furlough scheme to be positively associated with reporting going hungry but interestingly was negatively associated with difficulty in accessing food which is different to that found in Milovanska-Farrington [37]. This may be because people on the furlough scheme thought the pandemic and associated containment measure was a temporary situation so were willing to go hungry for a short period of time and would be returning to work in the short to medium term. Whereas in the Milovanska-Farrington study the sample were those who were unemployed so these people may have been less confident about their short to medium term finances.\n\nWhat this study adds\n\nWe found that in comparison with those who continued working those who were furloughed during the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK were more likely to report being hungry but not able to eat compared to those who were still working. Furloughed people were less likely to have difficulties in access to healthy and nutritious food compared to those who were still working. The furlough scheme has helped to keep unemployment lower than was otherwise forecasted by Office of Budget Responsibility [38]. Thus, successfully keeping some families out of food insecurity over the past 18 months. The furlough scheme and other government support provided such as the £20 uptick in Universal Credit has done much to help mitigate the negative economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. Hence if a person is eligible for any government support or redundancy payment, then reducing working hours or becoming unemployed may not necessarily negatively impact on finances in the short term. However, these schemes will close by the end of 2021, so it is important to understand which population groups are economically vulnerable and how this vulnerability relates to food insecurity.\n\nIn terms of needing to self-isolate due to Covid-19 symptoms as a factor contributing to food insecurity; the UK has the lowest level of statutory sick pay in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) [39]. There is also little practical and additional financial support available to those who need to self-isolate, particularly for people who are not already eligible for government benefits [40, 41]. This may explain our finding that having Covid symptoms explained 30% of the likelihood of not having access to healthy and nutritious food for young people; since when self-isolating they may not have been able to purchase the food they required.\n\nIn addition, logistical issues impacting on the supply of food in the UK, in Autumn 2021, has reduced donations of food from both supermarkets and the public. This will limit food banks and other charities’ ability to support those who do require food aid. This highlights the pressing need to ensure that more people do not end up in a position where they require food aid.\n\nThe lack of UK quantitative data on food insecurity, means that to date, this is an issue that is not well understood in the UK. The Understanding Covid Survey provides a novel opportunity to explore risks of food insecurity during the pandemic. We are able to investigate two dimensions of food insecurity: access and insufficient resources [23]. People may have difficulty accessing food but do not lack the resources to purchase food if available and vice versa. Thus, it is important to understand what socioeconomic characteristics are associated with each dimension. The policy responses to each dimension of food insecurity are also likely to be different. Thus, it is important to understand who is at risk for both dimensions of food insecurity and how this could be mitigated. However, there are some broader difficulties with putting this into a wider context given the existing unknowns about food insecurity pre-pandemic.\n\nOur findings can be used in the future to expand the provision of economic and social safety nets, to decrease the likelihood that those who are most at risk become food insecure. In turn, this will help to put the UK back on track to reach UN SDG2 of eliminating hunger, as well as mitigating the negative wider social and health consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLimitation\n\nDue to the complexity of measuring food insecurity, it is possible that the proxies used in our analyses may not have captured all food insecure households. The measures of food insecurity we employ have not been validated for use in this population. However, the Understanding Society Survey questions have been widely applied in international research and practice literature, thereby increasing the potential comparability of our findings [30]. The survey data overrepresents women and those who are more affluent which may reduce the generalisability of our findings. We are also unable to look at changes over time in our analysis. Future research should explore how food insecurity, and the factors contributing to food insecurity, change over time, as the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic unfold.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-023-00759-0', 'Headline': 'Dietary trends among young adults during the COVID-19 lockdown ...', 'Snippet': 'Background Healthy eating is vital to well-being and during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was especially important for boosting immunity and protecting against viral infections.

A balanced diet, rich in nutrients, is known to boost immunity, help protect against viral infections, and preserve long-term well-being [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Yet, by many accounts, a healthy diet was a casualty of the pandemic, rather than a means to fight it. In the early stage of the pandemic, a global economic model predicted disrupted food supply chains, price destabilization, hampered food access, and a shift away from nutrient-rich foods, such as fruit, meat, eggs, and dairy. This was expected to result in an increase in consumption deficiencies due to a lack of micronutrient content while intensifying already existing cases of undernourishment, especially among the poverty stricken [7, 8].\n\nWhile global organizations such as the International Food Policy Research Institute, the World Food Programme, and UNICEF, called attention to the devastating impacts on the world’s most impoverished regions such as in India and Sub-Saharan Africa [8], the circumstances were also dire in the wealthiest countries, including in the United States. The National Bureau of Economic Research declared the COVID-19 pandemic to have caused the worst American recession since the Great Depression [9] with growing numbers of people suffering joblessness, financial strains, and lack of access to nutrient rich food [10].\n\nLifestyle behaviors during lockdown conditions were found to reinforce these disturbing trends [11]. Studies found that more time spent at home promoted hypercaloric intake with larger meal sizes and increased frequency of snacking [12, 13]. One study found this to be especially true for females whose energy intake was about 20% greater during the pandemic [12]. Other studies linked poor eating habits to depressed moods and anxious feelings [4, 14,15,16]. Concerning issues with inactivity and weight control were also tied to the pandemic [13,14,15, 17,18,19,20].\n\nBut not all depictions of the pandemic’s impact on diet were negative [21,22,23]. There were plenty of rosy accounts of families making the best of times hunkered down together, cooking nutritious recipes, and gathering around the dinner table. One study found that with people staying at home and a decline in “eating out,” there was more consumption of home cooked meals, less fried foods, and with it, positive dietary changes and prevention of obesity [24]. Private industry studies reported more cooking, use of recipes, and confidence in healthy meal preparation [25, 26]. Narrative pieces in Gastronomica stressed a movement toward “creative living” and authenticity where home cooking was reconceptualized as a means for gaining a sense of control and agency during a time when everything else seemed out of control [27, 28]. In these depictions, COVID-19 seemed to have reclaimed the kitchen, food, and cooking, as central to dietary health and wellness.\n\nUnfortunately, in this abundant literature little attention has been paid to group level socioeconomic differences. This is important given the inequalities brought on by the pandemic and especially the evidence of socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 related health outcomes [29,30,31]. In one study, socioeconomic advantage was associated with lower odds of having a poor appetite while in lockdown [32]. Another study found that food insecurity was related to less cooking at home among low-income adults [33]. Research that focused on children and adolescents in Brazil found that lower-class families in home confinement and those from the Northeast region consumed a less healthy diet, with less fruits, juices, vegetables, and beans, than their more privileged counterparts [34].\n\nConsiderably more scholarly research has addressed gender differences in dietary concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic given sociocultural norms around household responsibilities and caregiving, and pre-existing gender-based vulnerabilities to stress, depression, and other diseases [35,36,37]. But the results of these studies of the pandemic’s impact on gender have been mixed. On the one hand, an abundant of research has shown that women’s dietary health suffered more than men’s during the pandemic [21, 38,39,40,41]. Several studies, for instance, have shown that women were more prone to stress and/or depression during the pandemic, which in turn, impacted dietary behaviors and overall health [21, 38, 42, 43]. A study based in Southern California, that also looked at sexual minorities, found that heterosexual women and sexual minorities were more likely to engage in adverse eating behaviors and self-harm than heterosexual men [39]. Some studies give evidence of women’s greater tendency to have deviated from their own dietary customs during the pandemic such as women in Italy who strayed from their Mediterranean diet [40] and women in Pakistan who trended away from their normally nutritious and diverse diet [41]. On the other hand, other studies such as one based in Spain [44], found that home confinement led to women developing better, not worse, dietary habits than men. Likewise, an Australian study found that it was men whose dietary habits became unhealthier during the pandemic, including their increased consumption of alcohol [45].\n\nThe current study contributes to this literature with a focus on the dietary practices of young adults, a largely overlooked demographic in studies on COVID-19’s impact on diet. The exception are studies that target college students and that therefore miss representation of a broader swath of the young adult population [46,47,48,49,50]. Young adults are an important demographic to consider since they experienced some of the most severe pandemic-related disruptions during a formative stage of development, a stage that is known to have profound implications on career paths, life-long economic security, and future bodily health [51]. During the pandemic young adults experienced disproportionate job losses [52, 53], had social lives abruptly curtailed at a time of life when peer groups are especially important [54], and many were uprooted from college environments. These changes are even more critical considering that before the pandemic, young adults were already experiencing alarming rates of depression, stress, and suicide [55, 56] which may have set them up to be exponentially vulnerable to COVID-19 related health problems.\n\nThe dietary practices of young adults during the pandemic could have either helped or hindered the vast challenges they faced at a time when a healthy diet was essential to well-being. This study specifically asked, how did the COVID-19 pandemic affect the dietary habits of young adults in the United States and how did the effects vary by socioeconomic group and by gender? Did dietary practices of young adults reflect the American class divide that was exacerbated during the pandemic? Did young men and women vary in their dietary behaviors and perceptions in ways that need our attention? Or was diet an aspect of life that young people experienced on an even playing field during the pandemic? Dietary practices on a broad range of measures were investigated. The intention was to contribute knowledge that could be useful for developing socioeconomically and gender sensitive policies aimed at mitigating harmful long-term outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic while preventing nutritional inequities during future public health crises.\n\nParticipants\n\nThis study employed a cross-sectional design. Inclusionary criteria included being 18 to 28 years of age and living in the United States. An anonymous questionnaire was developed specifically for this study and was distributed through the Qualtrics platform online through relevant social media groups on Facebook and Instagram. Purposive sampling technique was used. It was also distributed through a student email listserve of the university where the study took place. The questionnaire was available for a period of 20 days from November 10 to November 30, 2020. This online method was considered effective because it allowed for dissemination at a time when face-to-face distribution was restricted due to the pandemic and when internet usage was up due to home confinement measures [57]. The study received approval from the Institutional Review Board of the university where the study took place. All methods, including procedures for obtaining consent were applied in accordance with the Institutional Review Board’s guidelines and regulations. Prior to participating in the study respondents were informed of the study’s intentions and the voluntary nature of their participation. They also verified being at least 18 years of age.\n\nA total of 361 people attempted the survey. Participants who did not meet the inclusionary criteria and/or did not complete the survey were excluded. The result was a sample size of (N = 254) (Table 1). Lower-income participants made up 62% and higher-income participants comprised 38% of the sample. Most were female (71%). Males and females were distributed evenly across income categories (P = 0.559). The mean age of participants was 20.93 + 2.33 (SD). Most (70%) reported living with a parent(s), more than half (56%) lived with other family members, and some (18%) lived with a friend(s) and/or roommate(s) during the early stage of the pandemic. The biggest race/ethnic group self-reported as white (40%) followed by Latino/Hispanic (23%), Asian (16%), multiracial (13%), and black/African American (4%). The majority (88%) reported living in the Northeast region of the United States. Slightly more than half were current students (60%) and about two-thirds (67%) were currently employed in a paid job.\n\nMeasures\n\nComposition of the diet and sources of food\n\nParticipants were asked to report, retrospectively, on the composition of their diet and the sources of their food for two periods–before the pandemic and during the first few months of the pandemic. Composition of the diet was measured by “constant sum” questions to assess how the overall distribution of the diet across five food categories changed. Food groups were based on USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) and PCRM (Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine) guidelines for a healthy diet and included meats, dairy, grains, and fruits/vegetables. The authors added the category “junk food.” Sources of food were also measured by “constant sum” questions to assess changes in where food came from across five different sources. These included restaurants, fast food establishments, pre-prepared food, home cooked food from scratch, and junk food.\n\nHealthy eating behaviors\n\nHealthy Eating behaviors were measured based on an eight-item Healthy Eating Index (HEI) that the authors developed and adapted from previous questionnaires conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic [4, 16, 58, 59]. Participants were asked: “To what extent did the following habits become less healthy or more healthy during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before the pandemic?” Items ranged from overall perception of healthy eating and “indulging in unhealthy foods during boredom or distress” to “sense of hunger and satiety” and “amount/number of meals prepared at home.” Each item was based on a Likert scale (from 1, much less healthy to 5, much more healthy) and analyzed individually, and then, compositely (as a continuous index variable). The intent was to evaluate changes in eating habits from before the pandemic to the first few months of the pandemic in respect to how participants perceived their behaviors. Possible total scores on the composite index ranged from 8 (much less healthy) to 40 (much more healthy). An overall score that was < 24 was considered an overall unhealthy change while a score of > 24 was considered an overall healthy change. The alpha coefficient (Cronbach’s Alpha) for the eight items comprising the HEI was 0.787, suggesting a high internal consistency [60]. The skewness of continuous variables ranged from 0.054 to 1.824 and kurtosis ranged from -0.858 to 6.458, showing robust distributions within acceptable ranges for parametric testing [61, 62]. The alpha coefficient (Cronbach’s Alpha) for the eight items comprising the HEI was 0.787, suggesting a high internal consistency [60]. The skewness of continuous variables ranged from 0.054 to 1.824 and kurtosis ranged from -0.858 to 6.458, showing robust distributions within acceptable ranges for parametric testing [61, 62].\n\nFood insecurity\n\nFood insecurity was evaluated based on items adopted from the USDA Measurement of Household Food Security Survey [63] with a focus on evaluating both extent of worry about having enough food, and actually having enough to eat. Respondents replied on a Likert scale from 1(never, always had enough) to 5 (most of the time). In regression analysis, these two scales were combined to form an index variable. The combined scales had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.821, showing a high degree of reliability.\n\nChanges in physical activity and weight\n\nChange in physical activity level was measured on a Likert scale from 1 (much less) to 5 (much more) activity. Change in weight was also measured on a Likert scale from 1 (significant decrease) to 5 (significant increase).\n\nWho participants lived with\n\nParticipants were asked to report on who they lived with during the early stage of the pandemic including parent(s), other family members, and/or friends/roommates.\n\nCore demographic variables\n\nOur core demographic variables were household income and gender because of the evidence in the literature of COVID-19 related vulnerabilities related to low-income and female groups [29, 30]. Household income consisted of two categories, lower-income (< $70,000) and higher-income (≤ $70,000). The divide between income groups is based on median household income in the United States for 2019, the year prior to the pandemic ($68,400) [64]. Students living on their own were requested to report the income of the household where they were declared a dependent. Independent adults were asked to exclude the income of non-related household members. Gender consisted of multiple categories, male, female, non-binary and “other.” Gender based analysis included only the categories of male and female since only three respondents identified as non-binary or “other.” Covariates were included in regression analysis and consisted of age, student status, employment status, and who the participant lived with during the pandemic’s earliest stage.\n\nData analysis\n\nSPSS software (version 27) (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all analysis. Paired sample t-tests were conducted to investigate changes in dietary composition and sources of food. Cross tabulations were conducted to test associations between core demographic variables and changes in physical activity levels, weight, food insecurity, and individual items on the HEI index. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare mean scores of the HEI by household income and gender. Multiple linear regressions were run to find predictors of the HEI index. Statistical significance was considered at a P-value of < 0.05. Multicollinearity was checked with the aim of a VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) less than 5.\n\nChanges in dietary consumption\n\nThe biggest overall change in dietary composition was a reported increase in eating junk food, from 16% (SD = 13.06) of the diet before COVID-19 to 19% (SD = 14.61), (P = 0.008) during the first few months of the pandemic (Fig. 1). Meanwhile, reported meat consumption declined from (29% (SD = 18.12) to 27% (SD = 16.56), (P = 0.039) and reported grain consumption declined from 14% (SD = 11.79) to 13% (SD = 11.73), (P = 0.028) (Fig. 1). While every social group reported an increase in eating junk food, the increases were statistically significant only among lower income (P = 0.049) and male (P = 0.002) participants. Similarly, while every social group reported a decrease in the consumption of grains, the increases were significant only among these same groups–lower-income (P = 0.014) and males (P = 0.003). The decline in reported meat consumption was found only among higher-income participants (P = 0.044) and males (P = 0.042) (Table 2).\n\nChanges in sources of food\n\nParticipants reported a decline in getting food from restaurants from 18% (SD = 15.74) to 13% (SD = 15.91), (P < 0.001) while junk food sources increased from under 10% (SD = 10.53) before the pandemic to over 12% (SD = 11.41), (P < 0.001) during the pandemic (Fig. 2). Both males (P = 0.037) and females (P = 0.004) reported significant increases in junk food sources. But only lower-income (P = 0.002) and not higher-income (P = 0.115) participants reported significant increases. Meanwhile, only higher-income respondents reported a significant decline in getting food from fast food places (P = 0.013) and a significant increase in eating home-based meals that were cooked from scratch (Table 2).\n\nChanges in physical activity and weight\n\nOver 40% of participants reported gaining some or a lot of weight while nearly one-in-five (17%) reported losing weight. Lower-income participants (50%) and females (45%) had significantly higher rates of gaining weight than their higher-income (29%) and male (38%) counterparts. Meanwhile, higher-income (22%) and female (20%) participants had higher rates of losing weight compared to lower-income (15%) and male (10%) participants. A third of the participants (33%) reported becoming less active and more than a third (39%) became more active. There were no significant social group differences in reported activity levels (Table 3).\n\nFood insecurity\n\nNearly a quarter (22%) reported not having enough to eat at least occasionally and 16% indicated that they worried about where their next meal was coming from at least occasionally during the early part of the pandemic. Lower-income participants reported higher rates of food insecurity on both food security measures, while males reported higher rates than women in respect to worrying about where their next meal would be coming from (Table 3).\n\nPerceptions of healthy eating\n\nThe mean HEI score was 21.96 (SD = 5.38, range: 8 to 38) which indicates a change toward unhealthier dietary habits during the first few months of the pandemic (Table 4). More than half of the participants reported “less healthy” or “much less healthy” in four out of ten of the individual items that made up the HEI scale (Fig. 3). Lower-income participants had a significantly lower mean HEI score than higher-income participants (21.0 vs. 23.53, P < 0.001) and were significantly overrepresented in unhealthy trends in five of the individual items that make up the healthy eating index. There were no significant differences in HEI scores by gender.\n\nMultiple regression models were computed separately by household income group since significant income group difference were identified in bivariate analysis (Table 5). Gender was included as a covariate to investigate potential associations with HEI scores in both income-based models. Gender was a nonsignificant predictor in both models. An increase in weight (Beta = -0.24, P = 0.004) and a big increase in weight (Beta = -0.24, P = 0.004), and food insecurity (Beta = -0.18, P = 0.023) predicted lower HEI scores for lower-income participants. Becoming less active (Beta = -0.293, P = 0.016) becoming much less active (Beta = -0.295, P = 0.014), an increase in weight (Beta = -0.243, P = 0.026) and food insecurity (Beta = -0.277, P = 0.005) predicted lower HEI scores for higher-income participants. Living with people, particularly a friend(s)/roommate(s), was a predictor of more positive healthy eating scores for lower-income participants (Beta = 0.24, P = 0.009) while it had no power to predict HEI scores for higher-income participants.\n\nThe previous lack of attention on the young adult demographic in the literature on dietary practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, aside from those that focus on college students [50], was a primary motivation for the current study. Another aim was to investigate socioeconomic and gender-based differences among young adults given the known inequities induced by the pandemic. The results of this study show a clear overall trend toward more unhealthy consumption behaviors and dietary habits of young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic while some positive changes were also found. The overall consumption of junk food significantly increased, four out of ten gained weight, and the average participant reported less healthy eating habits overall, unhealthier snack consumption, and more emotional eating. These results echo findings from other studies both in the United States and in other wealthy nations that have found associations between the pandemic and dietary deterioration [4, 12,13,14,15,16,17,18, 45, 50, 65]. Healthier trends included less reliance on food from restaurants, and, for some, an increase in home cooked food from scratch.\n\nSocioeconomic inequalities\n\nGroup level differences by household income followed a clear pattern. Lower-income participants were disproportionately represented among those who reported unhealthy consumption behaviors and dietary habits while the opposite was true for higher-income participants. Both socioeconomic groups reported more negative than positive changes. But when there were positive changes, such as less reliance on fast foods and consuming more homecooked food from scratch, higher-income participants were overly represented among those who reported them. In this way, the widening socioeconomic disparities in society at large that were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic appear to be reflected in the dietary inequities found in this study.\n\nSocioeconomic differences may be explained, in part, by the defining characteristics of the American socioeconomic divide during COVID-19. Affluent Americans were more likely to remain employed, work from home, and not suffer income decline while lower-income Americans suffered disproportionate job loss, financial strain, and housing precariousness. Among lower-income Americans that remained working, they were more likely to work outside the home than their higher-income counterparts, and often in two or more jobs while facing risk of exposure to the virus [66, 67]. The economic impact was especially harsh for young workers who were disproportionately employed in entry level service sectors where job losses were particularly severe [52]. These disparate class-based experiences may help explain dietary inequities.\n\nCooking at home, for instance, requires planning, time, investment in raw products, and a modicum of stability [68], requirements that the affluent may have had enhanced capacity to meet during the pandemic and the lower-income may have had decreased capacity to meet. This study’s finding that home-based cooking from scratch significantly increased, and reliance on fast food significantly decreased among higher-income participants (but not among the lower-income) indicates that the pandemic’s positive influences on healthy eating [24, 27, 28] may have been a silver lining disproportionately enjoyed by the more privileged. On the other hand, a reliance on pre-prepared, processed, convenience and/or fast foods may have better correlated with the circumstances of those with less stable, downward spiraling lives, as they are cheap, readily available, and calorie dense. In a recent study involving focus groups, lower-income women reported that barriers to healthy eating included cost, convenience, and preparation time. This team of authors also noted that comfort foods may have been used as a coping mechanism for the multiple stressors and anxieties in their lives [69]. Another study showed a link between food insecurity and less cooking at home among low-income Americans during the pandemic [33]. In this way, the results of this study support existing research on how socioeconomic status is associated with dietary practices [70, 71].\n\nLower-income participants over representation among those who reported gaining weight is an added cause for concern especially since weight gain was among the strongest predictors for a lower score on the HEI. While both lower- and higher-income participants reported gaining weight during the pandemic, the proportions were more severe among those from lower-income households. When more than one in two lower-income young adults report gaining weight during the pandemic (versus one in four among higher-income participants), it suggests a class-based vulnerability to a host of metabolic diseases associated with unhealthy weight gain, such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension, all of which have been shown to downgrade immune responses, and make one more vulnerable to infections and less responsive to antivirals and vaccinations [72,73,74]. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified obesity and increased BMI as a risk factor for COVID-19 related illnesses, regardless of age [75]. Even more disturbing is that lower-income Americans already had higher rates of obesity than their more affluent counterparts, a disparity that has long been recognized before the pandemic [76,77,78].\n\nThe problem of food insecurity found in this study corresponds with what is already known about the pandemic’s influence on food accessibility, and the catastrophic problems with food access, panic, hoarding, and other alarming behaviors, in the pandemic’s earliest stage [33, 79]. The fact that nearly half of lower-income participants in this study struggled with getting enough to eat at least once or twice during the first few months of the pandemic and that nearly 8% did not have enough to eat on a regular basis, is deeply concerning. This finding is supported by a previous study of college students that found that those who identified as “working class” reported higher rates of food insecurity than their middle class and affluent peers [47]. On the other hand, it should not be missed that nearly a quarter of higher-income participants reported struggling with getting enough to eat at least once or twice during the pandemic, and for more than 5%, it was a regular occurrence. It is clear, that even though income background was found to be significantly correlated with food insecurity, it did not make anyone immune from the perils of hunger and malnutrition [80].\n\nOne of the more notable findings of this study is the income-based association between living with other people and HEI scores. On the one hand, the positive influence of having people around you, coalesces with a recent study in the UK that stressed the protective buffering effect of social support from friends and family during the pandemic and other studies that found associations between social support and dietary health [81]. On the other hand, the fact that this association showed up only among lower-income participants is surprising. It could be that lower-income young adults were more susceptible to the positive influences of social support (or lack thereof) due to their more challenging socioeconomic circumstances.\n\nGender inequalities\n\nIt is notable that men and women participants in this study did not significantly vary in their perceptions of healthy eating behaviors during the pandemic. But there were important gender-based nuances in how participants reported the composition of their diets which may have implications for the broader literature. For one, men’s significant increase in junk food consumption during the pandemic echoes the results of some studies that showed men’s greater intake of unhealthy products, including alcohol, during the pandemic [44, 45]. But it would seem to contradict several other studies that showed it was women who tended to eat more unhealthy foods during the pandemic [39,40,41], indulging more as a result of boredom, anxiety, fear, and/or depression [38, 82]. It is worth noting that in this current study, even though men reported a significant increase in junk food consumption, that it was women who reported a higher rate of eating junk food before the pandemic. In this way, it appears that male participants may have simply caught up with women’s previously higher rate of eating junk food while women kept indulging at a similar rate. Moreover, in respect to where participants got their food, it was both men and women who reported an increase in junk food sources.\n\nMeanwhile, women’s overrepresentation among participants who gained weight during the pandemic reflects a globally and historically recognized problem concerning women’s over representation among the obese and severely obese [37, 78]. It lends support to other studies that have raised alarm about women’s increased vulnerability to psychological distress during the pandemic [36, 83], barriers to healthy eating including eating disorders, sleep disruptions, and fluctuations in weight [35, 48], and risks to bodily health, including cardiovascular disease [42, 43].\n\nFuture studies could investigate gender-based circumstances during the earliest stages of the pandemic to find factors that could have impacted men and women differently. While we should be particularly attentive to weight fluctuation among women, and especially weight gain, we should also strive to understand differences in reporting on issues of food insecurity and their implications. For instance, why did significantly more men in this study (10% versus 2% for women) report worrying about where their next meal was coming from? Could it be that women were more likely than men to internalize problems related to food insecurity and were therefore less likely to recognize and report it? Could it be that traditional gender roles made women more resourceful about meal sources and preparation? Could it be related to men’s greater average caloric needs compared to women? These are questions that may be better explored through a qualitative approach.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21642850.2022.2043750', 'Headline': 'Full article: The impact of COVID-19 on the eating habits of families ...', 'Snippet': 'The finding that fears of food shortages and hunger led some families to break existing habits of not keeping energy-dense foods in the house also aligns with previous research with low-income parents, which found that fears of child hunger drove parents to provide children with foods that they felt guilty about providing (Pescud & Pettigrew ...', 'Full_text': ''}}",100.0,3

The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-did-it-robby-mook-michael-sussmann-donald-trump-russia-collusion-alfa-bank-11653084709', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton Did It - WSJ - The Wall Street Journal', 'Snippet': 'The Russia-Trump collusion narrative of 2016 and beyond was a dirty trick for the ages, and now we know it came from the top—candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Durham said the dossier was “unvetted and unverified,” yet was used as justification for surveillance.\n\n“Indeed, based on the evidence gathered in multiple exhaustive and costly federal investigations of these matters, including the instant investigation, neither U.S. law enforcement nor the Intelligence Community appears to have possessed any actual evidence of collusion in their holdings at the commencement of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,"" the report stated.\n\nThe political implications are clear, and the report highlights the favoritism shown to the Clinton campaign over Trump’s.\n\nGive Biden family the Trump treatment\n\nAs Durham details, the FBI fumbled the “collusion” investigation.

Durham alleges Sussmann lied to the FBI about who his client was during a meeting where Sussmann shared information about possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nBut in a few extra sentences, Durham\'s filing mentions a second instance where Sussmann tried to raise concerns of a Trump-Russia connection, this time apparently to the CIA. That information came from one of Sussmann\'s clients, technology executive Rodney Joffe.\n\nDurham\'s filing noted that Joffe\'s company, Neustar, had an arrangement to provide security-related work on computer servers, including the White House\'s. But, according to the filing, Joffe used that access to mine Internet data to establish an inference and narrative tying then-candidate Trump to Russia.\n\nJoffe has not been charged with any crime.\n\nAll of this has now been spun by conservative media and former President Trump himself to say Sussmann and Joffe were Clinton operatives who were paid to illegally hack into and spy on the Trump campaign and Trump White House.\n\nFormer President Trump wrote: ""In a stronger period of time in our country, this crime would have been punishable by death.""\n\nIn a column this week, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charlie Savage of The New York Times wrote that the entire narrative appeared to be mostly wrong or old news, and its conclusions ""based on a misleading presentation of the facts or outright misinformation.""\n\nCharlie Savage joins me now.\n\nI wonder if you could help us understand just initially how we got to this point, how Durham\'s investigation has morphed into this sort of explosive story in conservative media.\n\nCharlie Savage, The New York Times:\n\nSo, back in the Trump administration, right after Robert Mueller, the Russian special counsel, finished his report, Donald Trump shifted — tried to shift the narrative to or escalated his attempt to shift the narrative to the idea that he was actually a victim of a deep state conspiracy.\n\nAnd his attorney general, Bill Barr, as you mentioned, appointed John Durham, then a U.S. attorney, to be what became another special counsel, a special counsel to investigate the investigation.\n\nAnd the whole idea and expectation then was he was going to prove Trump\'s narrative that there were high-level officials who — in the FBI and the CIA who had essentially framed him for collusion.\n\nBut we\'re almost three years in now, and he has yet to bring any charges against the high-level officials. He has developed two cases against outsiders, and one of them is this Sussmann case. Both of these are merely false statement cases. They\'re not charging a conspiracy.\n\nBut Mr. Durham has used court filings and indictments and so forth, related to these cases to put out large amounts of information that are not directly related to the charges. And this information is imbued with insinuations that there is some kind of vast anti-Trump conspiracy.\n\nHe just hasn\'t been able to prove it yet or charge it. It all goes back to Hillary Clinton, is the implication.\n\nCharlie Savage:\n\nThere\'s been this repeated cycle of huge alarmism stoked within right-wing pro-Trump outlets that I don\'t really consider doing the same kind of journalism that I\'m doing sending out the message with the blaring outrage, grievance-stroking headlines that now it\'s been proven they were spying on President Trump.\n\nAnd every time you look at it, it — there\'s less there than meets the eye. But if you don\'t cover it, then that allows the sort of Trump world and his allies to say, aha, you know, the media, they\'re in on it. They\'re covering it up. It\'s a conspiracy.

He said New York Attorney General Letitia James ""should be ashamed of herself.""\n\nOver the course of four hours on the stand on Monday, Trump repeatedly strayed from the questions, earning reprimands from New York Judge Arthur Engoron on several occasions. The judge, who was seated just feet away from Trump, will decide the outcome of the bench trial himself.\n\nThe case stems from a $250 million civil lawsuit filed by James\' office, which accused Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives of a yearslong fraud scheme. The state alleges the defendants inflated the value of the company\'s assets and Trump\'s personal wealth to obtain better terms on loans and insurance. The attorney general is seeking to recoup $250 million and limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York. The defendants have all denied wrongdoing, and Trump has repeatedly accused James of pursuing him for political reasons.\n\nIn his testimony, the former president and current front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination stood by the valuations of various Trump properties that other co-defendants have sought to distance themselves from.\n\n""The numbers of my net worth are substantially more than the numbers reflected on the financial statements,"" he said in one exchange. ""Therefore you have no case.""\n\nTrump\'s testimony\n\nTrump arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan shortly before 10 a.m. and made brief remarks, reiterating his criticism of the trial.\n\n""It\'s a terrible, terrible thing. These are political operatives that I\'m going to be dealing with right now,"" Trump said. ""It\'s a very sad situation for our country.""\n\nOutside the courtroom, James predicted Trump would ""engage in name-calling, taunts and race-baiting,"" but said, ""At the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friend, don\'t lie.""\n\nTrump then took the stand. Kevin Wallace, a lawyer from the attorney general\'s office, kicked off the questioning by asking Trump about a trust he established to manage his assets before he entered the White House. When he left office in 2021, he took control of the trust, only to relinquish it again in July 2021. He testified that he did so because of increasing legal pressure from a number of fronts.\n\n""You and about every other Democrat district attorney, A.G., and U.S. attorney were coming at me from 15 different sides, all Democrats, Trump haters,"" Trump said, adding that he had ""great confidence"" in his son to manage his assets.\n\nTrump repeatedly gave long-winded answers to questions about the valuations of various Trump Organization properties, and Engoron\'s patience soon wore thin. Christopher Kise, one of Trump\'s attorneys, encouraged Engoron to allow Trump to give answers in his own way.\n\n""With this witness I would suggest it\'s far more efficient to listen to what he has to say and take it in,"" Kise said, prompting laughter from Wallace.\n\nEngoron\'s voice rose as his anger seemed to boil over, and his microphone struggled to handle the sudden change in volume.\n\n""No, I\'m not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron said, his voice rising. ""I\'m here to hear him answer questions. Sit down!""\n\nEngoron said he was considering drawing negative conclusions from Trump\'s testimony.\n\n""We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can\'t, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can,"" Engoron said.\n\nAfter a break, Wallace posed questions about the valuations of Trump\'s and his company\'s properties, including Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower in Manhattan and an upstate New York estate known as Seven Springs. Trump defended the financial statements listing their supposed value, saying that even those valuations that have been determined to be inflated were too low. He added that he would not be willing to sell several properties because they were worth so much.\n\nJames\' office says the documents, known as statements of financial condition, inflated his net worth by billions. Trump said the documents included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies.\n\n""The disclaimer clause says if there\'s a mistake, if there\'s something, don\'t rely on it,"" Trump said. ""[The disclaimers] always hold up in court, except maybe this court.""\n\nTrump also insisted that increases in property values over time justified overvaluations in the past, an argument Engoron has previously rejected. Discussing property valuations for 2014, Trump said, ""If you carry that forward to 2021, all of those valuations were low.""\n\nTrump became particularly animated during discussion of Mar-a-Lago, the Florida club where he resides for most of the year. Engoron\'s pretrial ruling finding Trump liable for fraud noted that the local assessor valued Mar-a-Lago at $18 million, while in documents Trump valued it at hundreds of millions more. The former president said in his testimony that he believes it\'s worth as much as $1.5 billion.\n\nThe property is ""deed-restricted"" and cannot be used as a residence, which experts previously told CBS News limits its value. Trump said he agreed to the deed restriction for tax purposes, acknowledging that the lower assessed value limits the property\'s tax burden. He then described a hypothetical scheme in which a person calls their own home a club to save money on taxes.\n\n""There are a lot of advantages to the club status, the smartest thing to do would be to have a club and have one member,"" Trump said.\n\nHe later argued about whether it was accurate to value one of his Scottish golf clubs as if he has built nearly 2,500 new homes on it, when in fact he has built none and is limited by contract to just under 1,500.\n\n""At some point maybe in my very old age I\'ll go there and do the most beautiful thing you\'ve ever seen,"" the 77-year-old said.\n\nLater in the day, Trump described a loan related to Chicago property as having been ""long since gone."" Pressed on that detail, he conceded it was actually paid off ""very recently.""\n\nWallace then asked, ""Are you aware that the Trump Chicago loan was paid off last week?""\n\nTrump said he was, and that, ""my son recommended it,"" referring to Eric Trump, who testified about that and other properties on Nov. 2 and 3.\n\nTrump said his company has begun looking into whether it needs to change internal policies as a result of the state\'s investigation.\n\n""There will be recommendations made, and we will perhaps let you know what those recommendations are, it wouldn\'t bother me to let you know about it. But we have asked,"" Trump said, adding that Eric Trump has been in charge of communicating with accountants and lawyers about that process.\n\nHe was excused from the witness stand shortly before 3:30 p.m., with the defense team declining to pose questions.\n\nThe fraud trial\n\nTrump is accused in the civil suit of being the primary beneficiary of a scheme to fraudulently portray his wealth as far greater than it is, and his properties as far more valuable, in order to get undeservedly favorable loan and insurance terms. The judge in the case has already found Trump, his two adult sons and their company liable for fraud, determining that the scheme led to hundreds of millions in unearned profits.\n\nThe trial is focused on other allegations, including falsification of business records, conspiracy and insurance fraud, as well as disgorgement — the exact amount of ""ill-gotten gains"" the Trumps must pay the state.\n\nTrump and his company have for more than a year blamed their former outside accountants, Mazars USA, for any inaccuracies in their statements of financial condition, essentially a snapshot of Trump\'s wealth. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump reiterated that defense in testimony last week, saying they ""trusted"" internal and external accounting teams.\n\nBut their former Mazars accountant testified in October that his firm merely compiled reams of financial information provided to them by the Trumps and their company.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking $250 million and sanctions designed to limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York, including permanently barring Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director in any business in the state.\n\nReporting contributed by Katrina Kaufman.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/who-are-the-key-players-in-the-jan-6-committee-hearings-so-far', 'Headline': 'Who are the witnesses testifying at the Jan. 6 hearings?', 'Snippet': 'The latest: Hutchinson offered new details during her June 28 testimony about what former President Donald Trump and Meadows knew in the days before the attack and how they responded while it was ...', 'Full_text': 'The House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has conducted more than 1,000 interviews over the course of the past year, seeking critical information and documents from people witness to, or involved in, the violence that day.\n\nThose interviews — including from some of Trump’s closest aides and allies — have taken center stage during the committee hearings so far. But the committee has also called a number of new witnesses to offer key details about the timeline of events that day, as well as Trump’s actions in the weeks before it.\n\nREAD MORE: The Jan. 6 hearings are starting. Here’s how to watch them\n\nIn the days ahead, advisers to then-Vice President Mike Pence and other former administrative staff may also appear to offer their accounts. Some have already participated in closed-door conversations with the committee; others have been subpoenaed for interviews or records.\n\nHere’s a guide to some of the key people who may testify or be discussed heavily throughout the course of the hearings.\n\nWitnesses and Key Players:\n\nMatthew Pottinger\n\nSarah Matthews\n\nStephen Ayres\n\nJason Van Tatenhove\n\nPat Cipollone\n\nCassidy Hutchinson\n\nJeffrey Clark\n\nJeffrey Rosen\n\nRichard Donoghue\n\nSteven Engel\n\nRep. Russell “Rusty” Bowers\n\nWandrea ArShaye “Shaye” Moss\n\nBrad Raffensperger\n\nGabriel Sterling\n\nGinni Thomas\n\nGreg Jacob\n\nJ. Michael Luttig\n\nJohn Eastman\n\nBJay Pak\n\nAl Schmidt\n\nChris Stirewalt\n\nBill Stepien\n\nBen Ginsberg\n\nBill Barr\n\nCaroline Edwards\n\nNick Quested\n\nPeter Navarro\n\nSteve Bannon\n\nMark Meadows\n\nMatthew Pottinger\n\nRole: Matthew Pottinger was the deputy national security adviser in the Trump White House.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Pottinger was part of a wave of resignations from the Trump White House in the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack. Pottinger was hired early into the administration and had stayed on through all four years.\n\nPottinger was also in the White House during much of the afternoon of Jan. 6, and, according to his testimony, tried to convince chief of staff Mark Meadows that Trump needed to diffuse the crowd.\n\nThe New York Times also reported ahead of the July 21 hearing that Pottinger told the committee about requests by Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser to deploy the National Guard.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Pottinger has voluntarily appeared before the committee and some of his testimony has already appeared as video during previous hearings.\n\nThe latest: Pottinger testified alongside former deputy press secretary for Trump, Sarah Matthews during the July 21 public hearing.\n\nIn his testimony, he said that he decided to resign from the administration, where he’d worked since the beginning of Trump’s term, when he saw the president’s 2:24 p.m. tweet deriding Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nAn aide handed him a sheet of paper with Trump’s tweet on it, Pottinger testified. It “disturbed” him that Trump was attacking Pence for carrying out his constitutional duty in overseeing the certification of Biden’s presidential victory, he said.\n\n“I simply didn’t want to be associated with the events that were unfolding at the Capitol,” he said, adding that the tweet added “fuel to the fire.”\n\nPottinger testified that his boss, former national security adviser Robert O’Brien, asked him to stay in his role until O’Brien returned from a trip, which Pottinger did. He left the next morning.\n\nWhen asked how the insurrection impacted national security, Pottinger said that presidential transitions are always times of increased vulnerability.\n\nBut he also said it allowed countries like Russia, China and Iran to paint a picture of a faltering American democracy. And he said allies could similarly worry about the strength of America’s institutions.\n\n“I think it’s incumbent upon us to put their minds at ease, to put our own hearts at ease, by investigating what happened on the sixth and making sure that it never happens again,” he said.\n\nSarah Matthews\n\nRole: Matthews is a former deputy press secretary for Trump.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from her? Matthews was one of a handful of staff in the Trump White House who resigned in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe eighth public hearing of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack focused on Trump’s actions during the insurrection, including the 187 minutes, or just over three hours where the attacks were underway, but he did not dissuade rioters despite calls from allies, members of Congress and aides to do so.\n\nAt its third public hearing on June 16, the committee showed footage of Matthews testifying that tweet “felt like he was pouring gasoline on the fire.”\n\nSince resigning, Matthews has been critical of Trump. On the one year anniversary of the attacks, Matthews tweeted that the Capitol riot was a “coup attempt” and said Trump “failed to meet the moment.”\n\nBut while she was in the administration, Matthews had previously defended the president’s actions. In June 2020, one week after Trump said the 2020 election would be “the most corrupt election in the history of our country,” while pointing to debunked election fraud claims, Matthews defended him, saying that “President Trump is highlighting that Democrats’ plan for mass mail-in system would lead to fraud.”\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Matthews testified before the committee on July 21 and has talked to the committee in private hearings as well.\n\nThe latest:\n\nDuring the July 21 hearing, Matthews testified that she, along with other staff in the West Wing on Jan. 6, asked people close to Trump to encourage him to condemn the violence that was underway at the Capitol.\n\nMatthews said she spoke to former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who later told her that Trump initially rejected using the word “peace” in any of his tweets until his daughter, Ivanka Trump, suggested the phrase “stay peaceful,” which he finally agreed to.\n\nWhen another colleague suggested Trump should not condemn the violence because it would hand a “win” to the media, Matthews gestured to a TV airing the insurrection and asked, “Does it look like we’re effing winning? Because I don’t think it does.”\n\nAnd when Matthews saw Trump’s tweet at 4:17 p.m., she said it struck her that he continued to push the lie that he won the 2020 election. Though she had a “small sense of relief” when Trump told the rioters to go home, she was disappointed that he didn’t distinguish between the peaceful protesters who attended his rally and the violent insurrectionists that attacked the Capitol.\n\nAs part of the White House press team, “I knew that I would be asked to defend that. And to me, his refusal to act and call off the mob that day and his refusal to condemn the violence was indefensible. And so I knew that I would be resigning that evening,” Matthews testified.\n\nA later tweet by Trump at 6:01 p.m. “further cemented” that decision, she said. Matthews said she believed Trump needed to commit to an orderly transition of power, something he didn’t do until a tweet the following day. Instead, he tweeted:\n\n“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”\n\n“I thought that Jan. 6, 2021 was one of the darkest days in our nation’s history and President Trump was treating it as a celebratory occasion with that tweet,” Matthews said.\n\nStephen Ayres\n\nRole: Stephen Ayres was a Trump supporter who attended the Jan. 6 “Stop the Steal” rally and ensuing riot at the Capitol. He has pleaded guilty to entering the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Ayres had been an avid Trump supporter who repeated the former president’s social media calls to action ahead of Jan. 6. Ayers shared one of Trump’s tweets telling supporters to come to Washington on Jan. 6.\n\n“Where will you be on January 6th?” Ayers wrote on Facebook according to a government affidavit and arrest warrant. He added “are you willing to start fighting for the American Dream[?]”\n\nThe committee’s July 12 hearing focused on the role of extremism among far-right groups that went to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The committee also presented evidence about the ways that a Dec. 19, 2020 tweet from president Trump to participate in the Jan. 6 protest “was a siren call to these folks,” according to committee member, Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Ayres voluntarily testified to the committee, the committee’s chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said during the seventh public hearing on July 12.\n\nThe latest: During his testimony, Ayres recounted how he was swept up in Trump’s false claims of voter fraud, and believed the election was stolen, in part because he followed the former president on several social media accounts.\n\nAyres described himself as an American “family man” who worked at a cabinet company in northeast Ohio and enjoyed playing basketball and camping with his family. Ayres represented the many unaffiliated Trump supporters who went to protest on Jan. 6, committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said on July 12.\n\nAyres attended the “Stop the Steal” rally Jan. 6, but had no intention of going to or entering the Capitol until Trump instructed his followers to march to the building.\n\n“Basically, the president got everyone riled up, told everyone to head on down, so we were following what he said,” Ayres said. As the attack on the Capitol began and members of Congress and Vice President Mike Pence were forced into secure locations amid the insurrection, Trump initially refused to condemn the rioters. Ayres said that when Trump finally asked the rioters to leave, they did so. He believes that if Trump had asked the rioters to leave the Capitol earlier in the attack, people would have likely left.\n\nSince then, Ayres testified, he’s stopped believing the election was stolen. He lost his job, had to sell his home and pleaded guilty to disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds. He testified that following Trump’s call on Jan. 6 changed his life “not for the good, not for the better.”\n\n“I was hanging on every word [Trump] was saying. Everything he was putting out I was following it. I mean, if I was doing it, hundreds of thousands or millions of other people were doing it. Or maybe even still doing it,” Ayres said.\n\nJason Van Tatenhove\n\nRole: Van Tatenhove is the former spokesperson for the Oath Keepers, a far-right paramilitary organization.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? The committee’s seventh public hearing on July 12 focused on the days leading up to Jan. 6, including a December tweet Trump sent calling for his supporters to come to a rally on that day, and how his supporters were galvanized by this call.\n\nVan Tatenhove handled the media operations for the Oath Keepers’ for about two years, starting in 2014. He told Denver’s Fox 31 he was not connected to the group at the time of the attack on the Capitol. He said he’s since “purged” his connections to extremism.\n\nThe Oath Keepers is “one of the largest far-right antigovernment groups” in the U.S., according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Recruitment efforts target ex-military and law enforcement officers, and members have participated in armed standoffs and violent protests, the SPLC said.\n\nIn January, the leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, and 10 members were charged with seditious conspiracy for attempting to overthrow the government on Jan. 6. Rhodes has pleaded not guilty. According to the Jan. 6 committee, Rhodes on Election Day told members to “stock up on ammo” and prepare for a “full-on war in the streets,” if Trump didn’t win the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn his testimony, Van Tatenhove said that Rhodes is critical to the organization and that the Oath Keepers are “largely Stewart Rhodes.”\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: Van Tatenhove testified on July 12 that despite wanting to portray themselves otherwise, the Oath Keepers are a violent militia who used military tactics as they attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n“The best illustration for what the Oath Keepers are happened Jan. 6 when we saw that stacked military formation going up the stairs of the Capitol,” Van Tatenhove said.\n\nHe left the group after he overheard some members denying the Holocaust, he testified on July 12, though he said he probably should have left sooner.\n\nMuch of Van Tatenhove’s testimony focused on Rhodes who, according to Van Tatenhove, sees himself as a paramilitary leader.\n\nHe said that in the lead up to Jan. 6, Rhodes wanted Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that empowers the president to call up militias to tamp down rebellions, because Rhodes believed this would grant him and the Oath Keepers “legitimacy” as a paramilitary organization.\n\n“[Rhodes] is a militia leader. He had these grand visions of being a paramilitary leader,” Van Tatenhove said. “And the Insurrection Act would have given him a path forward with that. The fact the president was communicating, whether directly or indirectly messaging, that gave him the nod. All I can do is thank the gods that things did not go any worse that day.”\n\nTatenhove said he believes Jan. 6 could have been more violent and that the country must reckon with the fact that such a threat still exists.\n\n“I think we need to quit mincing words and just talk about truths, and what it was going to be was an armed revolution. I mean, people died that day. Law enforcement officers died that day. There was a gallows set up in front of the Capitol. This could have been the spark that started a new civil war and no one would have won there,” Van Tatenhove said.\n\nHe is also worried what Trump might do if he runs for reelection again and if the people who orchestrated the Jan. 6 attack are not held responsible.\n\n“I have three daughters. I have a granddaughter. I fear for the world that they will inherit if we do not start holding these people to account,” Van Tatenhove said.\n\nRhodes has also offered to testify to the Jan. 6 committee if he can do so live and in-person, instead of from jail, where he is awaiting trial. The committee has not responded to his request.\n\nPat Cipollone\n\nRole: Cipollone was White House counsel during the last two years of the Trump presidency, including in the aftermath of the 2020 election and run-up to the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? As White House counsel, Cipollone was the Trump administration’s top lawyer. He was present for key meetings in which Trump and some of his allies discussed strategies to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election, according to his testimony at the seventh public House hearing on July 12.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Cipollone was subpoenaed June 29 by the Jan. 6 Committee and testified on July 8 for a private, on-camera interview.\n\nThe latest: At the Jan. 6 committee’s July 12 hearing, the committee showed clips of Cipollone’s recorded testimony in which he described internal disagreements over how to handle baseless claims of voter fraud and the role of extremist groups in helping perpetuate those claims.\n\nCipollone condemned the actions of Trump’s former lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, who both promoted baseless claims of widespread election fraud. In particular, Cipollone said he fruitlessly asked Powell for evidence that as she claims, voting machines had been hacked or votes had been changed.\n\n“At some point, you have to put up or shut up,” Cipollone said during the July 12 hearing.\n\nPowell and Giuliani also pushed for the federal government to seize voting machines, which Cipollone said was a “terrible idea” without basis in law.\n\n“That’s not how we do things in the United States. There’s no legal authority to do that and there is a way to contest elections, that happens all the time, but the idea that the federal government could come in and seize election machines?” Cipollone said.\n\n“It’s a terrible idea.”\n\nCipollone said he also opposed a plan to appoint Powell as a special counsel to investigate the false voting machine claims and was present during a heated meeting that lasted multiple hours in the White House with Trump involving Powell, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and others.\n\nAfter the meeting, the committee said, Trump tweeted “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!”\n\nBetween that meeting and Jan. 6, Cipollone continued to dispute the voter fraud narrative, and supported the fact that Vice President Mike Pence had no legal authority to stop the count of electoral votes on Jan. 6, he said.\n\nIn an informal interview on April 13, Cipollone gave a statement to the Jan. 6 Committee indicating he had initially stopped Department of Justice lawyer Jeffrey Clark, who had been proposing ways to further Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud, from meeting with the president.\n\nClark went on to communicate with the president about his ideas, and in one meeting, Trump discussed the possibility of Clark replacing acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who refused to overturn the 2020 election results, according to testimony from the hearings.\n\nFormer Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue and top Department of Justice official Steven Engel told the committee on June 23 that Cipollone also refused to acquiesce to Trump’s demands and shared the belief that Clark was not capable to lead the Department of Justice. He was supportive as top officials threatened to resign if Clark was named head of the department, they said\n\nAccording to Hutchinson’s testimony June 28, Cipollone told her on Jan. 3 that he was worried about the legal consequences if Trump went to the Capitol on Jan. 6. Cippollone warned her again on the morning of Jan. 6 as she was preparing to go to Trump’s rally on the Ellipse, she told the committee.\n\nAfter the rally, as rioters broke into the Capitol and disrupted the counting of electoral votes, Hutchinson said she witnessed an exchange between Cipollone and her immediate supervisor, Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, in which Cipollone pushed Meadows to get Trump to do something to stop the violence.\n\nShe recalled Cipollone saying something to the effect of “Mark, something needs to be done, or people are going to die and the blood’s going to be on your effing hands,’” Hutchinson said in her testimony.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson\n\nRole: Hutchinson was an aide to former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from her? As an aide to the then-chief of staff, Hutchinson was privy to many conversations between the president and Meadows that happened before the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and in the days that followed. She has already been interviewed by the committee and testimony from her taped interviews before the committee have been played out in previous hearings.\n\nHutchinson has reportedly sat for more than 20 hours of interviews with the committee. Some of her video testimony has been played out at previous hearings, including on June 23, when the committee shared a clip of her saying that she was involved in conversations about possible Jan.6 pardons with several lawmakers and staff, including Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Mo Brooks, R-Ala., Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., Louie Gohmert, R-Texas and Scott Perry R-Pa. A few of the lawmakers named said in statements following the hearings that they did not make such requests. In earlier video testimony, Hutchinson said Meadows and former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani were involved in early efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential elections by plotting to put forward fake electors. The June 28 hearing would be the first time Hutchinson testifies before the committee in person.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes, Hutchinson testified June 28. Committee vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said the committee received evidence that people had contacted Hutchinson ahead of the hearings attempting to interfere with her testimony, adding that it would consider how to handle that offense in the coming weeks.\n\nThe latest: Hutchinson offered new details during her June 28 testimony about what former President Donald Trump and Meadows knew in the days before the attack and how they responded while it was underway, including a first-hand account of the president’s frustration and an attack on security detail who told him they could not secure a trip to the Capitol amid the unfolding violence by rioters.\n\nHutchinson detailed a slow response from Meadows as details emerged about weapons and threats to the vice president, who was at the Capitol overseeing the counting of electoral votes, and Trump’s resistance in the aftermath to publicly acknowledge the violence of rioters, or that the election was over and that he had not won.\n\nShe told the committee that agency heads, White House staff, advisers and lawyers had expressed concern about Jan. 6 and the president’s participation in it. Much of that guidance reached the president itself, but the first line of defense was often Meadows, who was with the president throughout the election aftermath and the events of that day. In her role as senior adviser, Hutchinson accompanied Meadows almost everywhere, including alongside the president and in frequent trips to Capitol Hill and meetings with lawmakers, she said.\n\nSome highlights of her testimony:\n\nWarnings of violence on Jan. 6 to Trump and Meadows. Hutchinson recalled a meeting between Meadows and Tony Ornato, a White House deputy chief of staff tasked with security, around 10 a.m. on the morning of the attack, in which Ornato warned him of rally-goers with knives, guns, pistols and rifles, body armors spears and flag poles.Meadows was slow to react, Hutchinson said, but eventually asked if Ornato had informed the president, to which Ornato responded he had.\n\nLegal concerns. Several White House lawyers warned Trump against using certain language in his speech at the Ellipse, and against making a trip to the Capitol himself, Hutchinson said. Hutchinson recalled guidance from then-Trump legal adviser Eric Hershmann to not include calls to fight for Trump or march to the Capitol during his speech, both because of legal concerns and optics about what the president wanted people to do that day. She also said Hershmann warned against including specific references to then-Vice President Mike Pence. White House lawyer Pat Cipollone approached Hutchinson several times before Jan.6 with legal concerns. They’d “charged with every crime imaginable” if the trip happened,” Hutchinson recalled him saying, adding that in the days before the attack they’d had conversations about specific charges of obstruction of justice or defrauding the electoral count.\n\nThe Ellipse speech When they arrived at the rally, Trump was “furious” that the front area in front of the stage was not full, Hutchinson said. He was informed that people did not want to enter the space, which was being monitored by magnetometers, because they did not want their weapons confiscated. Trump repeatedly urged security to let them through, despite those security measures. “I don’t [f***ing] care that they have weapons,” Hutchinson recalled Trump saying, adding that they weren’t there to hurt him and to take the magnetometers away. “‘Let them in. Let my people in,’” Hutchinson recalled the president saying. “‘They can march to the Capitol from here.’”\n\nTrump’s attempts to go to the Capitol. Hutchinson said while at the Ellipse, it was becoming clear to Secret Service that Capitol Police were having problems controlling the perimeter of the Capitol and defending against rioters, especially as the crowd grew. Before and after the president’s speech, Hutchinson said she warned Meadows a Capitol trip was not possible, based on guidance from security. On the way to Trump’s vehicle afterward, Meadows told the president that the head of his detail, Bobby Engel, had more information about the trip to the Capitol, Hutchinson said. When Trump got into the car, Engel told him they didn’t have the assets for the trip and that it wasn’t secure. Trump became “irate,” Hutchinson said White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato recalled to her after she returned to the White House. Trump said something to the effect of, “I’m the effing president, take me up to the Capitol now,” Hutchinson recalled. After Engel relayed they had to return to the White House, Trump reached up to the front of the vehicle to grab the steering wheel. Engel grabbed the president’s arm and said “Sir, you need to let go,” Hutchinson recalled. Trump then used his free hand to lunge toward Engel’s neck, Ornato told Hutchinson.\n\nResponse to violence. Trumps’ lawyers, advisers and daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, all encouraged the president to have a stronger response to the violence the day after the attacks, Jan. 7. Though Trump eventually did make a statement that day, Hutchinson said she learned the president had resisted the idea of giving a speech, and objected to some of the language in the original draft, including any acknowledgement of prosecuting the rioters, calling them violent, or that “this election is now over.”Trump also wanted to put in a promise of pardons for the rioters, which those around him ultimately convinced him to omit, Hutchinson said.\n\n“As an American, I was disgusted,” Hutchinson said of Trump’s tweet about Pence on Jan. 6. “It was unpatriotic. It was un-American. We were watching the Capitol building get defaced over a lie,” she told the committee.\n\nA pardon request. Hutchinson testified that Meadows sought a pardon for his role on Jan. 6.\n\nMore on Hutchinson’s testimony.\n\nJeffrey Clark\n\nRole: Clark was a high-ranking DOJ official in the Trump administration.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Clark was one of the few lawyers within the Department of Justice who was willing to act on Donald Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud and requests for help in overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, witnesses said during the committee’s June 23 hearing.\n\nFederal agents searched Clark’s Virginia home on June 22, a day before the fifth Jan. 6 committee hearing.\n\nIn a 2021 New York Times story on the alleged plan to fire Rosen, Clark denied being part of an effort to oust Rosen.\n\n“There was a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president. It is unfortunate that those who were part of a privileged legal conversation would comment in public about such internal deliberations, while also distorting any discussions,” Clark told the New York Times.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Clark was subpoenaed by the committee and agreed to be interviewed. However, that interview was cut short by Clark. In its June 23 hearing, the committee showed video of Clark invoking his 5th Amendment protections against self-incrimination at least twice.\n\nThe latest: Clark did not appear publicly at the fifth committee hearing, but most of the witness testimony focused on his actions in Trump’s final weeks in office.\n\nCheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., questioned former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, former Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue and former Assistant Attorney General Jeff Engel about Clark’s actions, especially his offers to help the president in efforts to overturn the election.\n\nRosen told the committee that Clark was violating department policy from the start by communicating with anyone at the White House, since typically only the attorney general or deputy attorney general does so. Rosen reprimanded Clark, one of his employees, for talking to Trump in a private meeting about the issue. Rosen said Clark was “contrite” and assured him he did not intend to meet with the president again.\n\nBut Clark discussed the election with Trump many more times, including drafting a letter to send to state legislatures saying the department had concerns about the election and instructing them to find an alternate slate of electors.\n\nWithin a week, Trump had told Clark he intended to have him replace Rosen as acting attorney general. At the committee hearing, Kinzinger showed the White House call logs on Jan. 3, noting that Clark was already being noted as “Acting Attorney General.”\n\nUltimately, in a two and a half hour meeting that evening, according to Rosen, Donoghue and Engel, Trump decided not to replace Rosen with Clark.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the president asked what was next for Clark, implying that Donoghue would fire him. When the deputy attorney general explained that only Trump had the power to fire Clark, Trump replied, “Well I’m not going to fire him,” Donoghue said.\n\n“All right, well, then we should all get back to work,” Donoghue recalled responding.\n\nJeffrey Rosen\n\nRole: Rosen was acting attorney general under Trump during the final days of his presidency, replacing Attorney General William Barr when Barr resigned in December 2020.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? After Trump lost the election, he pressured Department of Justice officials, including Rosen, to help him overturn the results. That included telling them, “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican Congressmen,” according to a Senate Judiciary report.\n\nAnother Department of Justice lawyer, Jeffrey Clark, concocted a plan for the department to send letters to states Trump lost, instructing them to appoint an alternate slate of electors who would vote for Trump. Clark outlined the plan to Trump, who threatened to replace Rosen with Clark unless Rosen signed his name to the letters and sent them, according to the report.\n\nRosen refused to cooperate with the plan, according to the report.\n\nUltimately, Trump did not fire Rosen and the letters were never sent.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Rosen testified in the June 23 public hearing and in closed-door meetings with the committee. He has also cooperated with the Senate Judiciary investigation.\n\nThe latest: At the June 23 hearing, Rosen explained in great detail how the president repeatedly contacted him and other department officials with false claims of voter fraud, and how he regularly debunked those claims and explained their inauthenticity.\n\nBetween Rosen’s appointment as acting attorney general on Dec. 23, 2020, and Jan. 5 2021, Trump contacted him “virtually every day” expressing his “dissatisfaction” that the Justice Department hadn’t done enough to investigate voter fraud, Rosen testified.\n\nTrump asked him to appoint a special counsel to investigate election fraud, meet with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, file a lawsuit in the Supreme Court, make public statements or hold a press conference about election fraud, and send a letter to state legislatures, Rosen said.\n\n“I will say that the Justice Department declined all of those requests … because we did not think that they were appropriate based on the facts and the law as we understood them,” Rosen testified.\n\nRosen said that during every conversation, he explained that what Trump wanted was not part of the department’s purview. For a similar reason, Rosen said he refused to meet with Trump campaign officials, saying that would not be appropriate.\n\nMeanwhile, Clark had been meeting with the president and validating his false claims of fraud despite Rosen’s direct orders against this, Rosen testified. When Rosen and his deputy, Richard Donoghue, refused to sign a letter Clark wanted to send to states, instructing them to find an alternate slate of electors, Clark told Rosen that Trump wanted to make Clark acting attorney general, replacing Rosen.\n\nAt the June 23 hearing, Rosen, who testified alongside Donoghue and Steven Engel, a former assistant attorney general, explained to the committee why he didn’t want Clark in his role.\n\n“It wasn’t about me. There’s only 17 days left in the administration. At that point, I would have been perfectly content to have either of the gentlemen on my left or right replace me if anybody wanted to do that,” Rosen said, gesturing to Engel and Donoghue. “But I did not want for the Department of Justice to be put in a posture where it would be doing things that were not consistent with the truth, were not consistent with its own appropriate role or were not consistent with the Constitution.”\n\nUltimately, Trump decided not to replace Rosen with Clark.\n\nOn the day of the Jan. 6 attack, Rosen said he spoke with various members of Congress, Vice President Mike Pence and members of his own department, but not Trump.\n\nRichard Donoghue\n\nRole: Donoghue was the acting deputy attorney general in the last year of Trump’s presidency.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Donoghue was among the Department of Justice officials who resisted pressure to validate Donald Trump’s claims of election fraud.\n\nDuring the first day of testimony for the Jan. 6 Committee on June 10, Rep Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said Donoghue was among the Department of Justice lawyers who had investigated but did not find evidence of Trump’s unfounded allegations of voter fraud. He was also among those who refused to use their positions to further the former president’s claims.\n\nTrump considered replacing acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen with another Department of Justice lawyer, Jeffrey Clark, who had been telling the president he could help him overturn the election results, according to the committee. Donoghue was among the Justice lawyers who threatened to resign if this happened.\n\nIn previously recorded testimony, Donoghue said Trump would ask about an election fraud claim, and after he debunked it, the president would then quickly move on to another claim.\n\nDonoghue said Trump’s claims included Native Americans “being paid to vote,” voting errors in Michigan, truckloads of ballots being shipped from New York to Pennsylvania and “suitcases” of votes being dumped in Georgia. Donoghue said he gave explanations to Trump that debunked all those allegations.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Donoghue testified in the committee’s June 23 hearing, alongside former acting attorney Jeffrey Rosen and Steven Engel, a former assistant attorney general.\n\nThe latest: At the committee’s Jun. 23 hearing, Donoghue offered more detail on how the former president tried to pressure Justice Department officials to help him overturn the results of the election.\n\nDonoghue said Trump contacted him repeatedly in December 2020. The requests “became more urgent,” as Trump became “more adamant” that officials should investigate his false claims of voter fraud.\n\nDonoghue testified that he explained to Trump why each of his claims had been debunked, and that the Justice Department wouldn’t file a lawsuit on behalf of the American people, because the department’s only client is the U.S. government.\n\n“We simply did not have standing,” Donoghue said. “We tried to explain that to the president on numerous occasions.”\n\nDonoghue also took contemporaneous notes during his phone calls with Rosen and Trump, and the committee regularly referred back to them.\n\nAccording to one of his notes, Rosen told Trump that the Justice Department “can’t and won’t snap its fingers and change the outcome of the election.”\n\nIn response, Trump said, “That’s not what I’m asking you to do. What I’m asking you to do is just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,” Donoghue testified.\n\nWhen Donoghue received an email from Clark outlining his proposed letter asking states to send new slates of electors to support Trump, he said he felt he needed to respond immediately to discredit the idea because it was “so extreme.”\n\nEventually, Donoghue, Rosen, Clark and others met with the president Jan. 3 to discuss Trump’s idea to replace Rosen with Clark as acting attorney general.\n\nDonghue was vehemently against the idea, he testified.\n\n“Mr. President, you should have the leadership that you want but understand the United States Justice Department functions on facts, evidence and law,” Donoghue said he told Trump. “And those are not going to change. So you can have whatever leadership you want, but the department’s position is not going to change.”\n\nTrump ultimately decided not to fire Rosen.\n\nSteven Engel\n\nRole: Engel served as assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel during the Trump administration.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Engel and other senior Justice Department officials threatened to resign if Trump fired acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and named DOJ lawyer Jeffrey Clark to the top job days before the Electoral College votes would be counted at the U.S. Capitol, he testified to the committee. . If installed, Clark, who was in charge of the Justice Department’s civil division at the time, planned to use his new position to help change the results of the 2020 election.\n\nEngel was also part of a White House meeting on Jan. 3, 2021 in which he and other senior Justice Department officials told Trump they would all resign if Clark replaced Rosen. Trump decided not to fire Rosen.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: In Jun. 23 testimony, Engel testified alongside Rosen and Donoghue about Trump’s efforts to pressure the Justice Department to help overturn the election.\n\nHe explained how Clark’s communication with Trump violated long-held department policy of only the attorney general or deputy attorney general speaking with the White House.\n\n“It’s critical that the Department of Justice conducts its criminal investigations free from either the reality, or any appearance, of political interference,” Engel testified. “People can get in trouble if people at the White House are speaking with people at the department, and that’s why the purpose of these policies is to keep these communications as infrequent and at the highest levels as possible.”\n\nEngel was also present for a Jan. 3 meeting with Trump, Rosen and former acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue, where the president debated replacing Rosen as acting attorney general with Clark.\n\nThe conversation lasted for more than two hours, according to their testimony, and Engel was among those trying to convince Trump not to replace Rosen.\n\n“My recollection is that when the president turned to me and said, ‘Steve, you wouldn’t leave, would you?’ I said, ‘Mr. President, I have been with you through four attorneys general, including two acting attorneys general. But I couldn’t be part of this,’” Engel testified.\n\nHe also told Trump that Clark’s letter would not be the bombshell he’d hoped, but would instead result in a public narrative of the president having fired two attorneys general to find the one who would do his bidding.\n\n“It’s going to be the disaster of Jeff Clark,” Engel said, recalling that White House lawyer Pat Cipollone agreed, calling it a “murder-suicide pact.”\n\nRep. Russell “Rusty” Bowers\n\nRole: Bowers is a Republican member of the Arizona House of Representatives, where he also serves as speaker.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Bowers was one of several state-level Republican lawmakers who supported Trump’s re-election campaign in 2020. After Trump’s loss, Bowers defended the election results in his state, where President Joe Biden came out on top.\n\nIn May, Bowers was one of five people to receive this year’s John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, given to public officials who protect U.S. democracy.\n\n“As a conservative Republican, I don’t like the results of the presidential election,” Bowers said, according to the awards page. “I voted for President Trump and worked hard to reelect him. But I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we violate current law to change the outcome of a certified election.”\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: Bowers was the first witness to testify before the Jan. 6 Committee during its June 21 hearing. He described getting phone calls from Trump and Giuliani, who made allegations of voter fraud and asked him to convene a special hearing of the legislature to consider the allegations. Bowers told the committee he refused because he did not believe evidence of election fraud was sufficient. They also suggested that Arizona law would allow Bowers to remove Biden’s electors and recognize electors for Trump.\n\n“And I said, ‘That’s totally new to me. I’ve never heard of any such thing,’” Bowers told the committee.\n\nBowers told Trump and Giuliani that this was not possible and that taking action based on hearsay evidence would be a violation of his oath of office.\n\n“I said, ‘Look, you are asking me to do something that is counter to my oath, when I swore to the Constitution to uphold it. And I also swore to the Constitution and the laws of the state of Arizona, and this is totally foreign as an idea or a theory to me. You are asking me to do something against my oath and I will not break my oath,’” Bowers testified.\n\nBowers also testified that Giuliani expected him to be more receptive to his claims of voter fraud because they were both Republicans.\n\n“He would say, “Aren’t we all Republicans? I would think we would get a better reception — that you would listen to my suggestions,’” Bowers said.\n\nDespite Bowers’ refusal to participate in what the former president suggested, lawmakers in the state pursued other efforts. Arizona’s Senate went on to authorize a recount of presidential and U.S. Senate results from Maricopa County, a process that has been a consistent source of misinformation about the election, including from the conservative firm hired to analyze results. Independent fact checkers and election analysts have dubbed the firm’s methods deeply flawed. The report confirmed Biden’s win and found no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nAlong with blocking the request from Trump and Giuliani, Bowers also intervened in January 2022 to stop a House bill that would have given the state legislature power to choose its slate of presidential electors, overriding the winner chosen by voters.\n\nWandrea ArShaye “Shaye” Moss\n\nRole: Wandrea ArShaye “Shaye” Moss was an elections worker in Georgia during the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from her? In targeting Georgia with baseless claims of voter fraud, former President Donald Trump and his allies accused Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, of being behind fake ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, where they served as election workers.\n\nAfter the election, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies of the former president repeatedly promoted the false conspiracy theory that election workers in the county tampered with the vote count to tilt the race toward Joe Biden. They pointed to a video posted by a conservative PAC that purported to show election workers packing ballots into “suitcases.” As reported by USA Today and other fact checkers, election workers were packing absentee ballots into storage containers, a routine practice, because they thought the day’s counting was done. The video was played by conservative media outlets and also included in a lawsuit from Trump alleging voter fraud in Georgia. Giuliani also alleged that Freeman handed Moss a USB drive during her election work. Moss testified on June 21 that it was actually a ginger candy.\n\nMoss was one of five recipients for this year’s John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, given to public officials who protect U.S. democracy. Moss was honored for “doing the hard and unseen work to run our democracy.”\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Moss testified June 21.\n\nThe latest: Moss said during her testimony June 21 that she became an election worker because her family had throughout her life stressed the importance of voting, a right that her grandmother often pointed out was not available to generations before her. She loved helping connect people to the process, she said.\n\nShe discovered her name had been used by Trump and his allies when election officials called her into their office, saying they’d received threats and asking if she had been targeted. In her Facebook Messenger app, she found dozens of threats and death threats, many of them racist in nature.\n\nBoth Moss and her mother, along with her grandmother, were targeted by death threats, she testified before the committee. At the suggestion of the FBI, Freeman said she left her home for about two months for her safety, through the events of Jan. 6 and the inauguration.\n\nIn video testimony played by the committee, Freeman said she doesn’t introduce herself by name anymore and gets worried when she gives her name for food orders or at the grocery store.\n\n“I’ve lost my name and I’ve lost my reputation. I’ve lost my sense of security all because a group of people people starting with Number 45 and his ally Rudy Giuliani decided to scapegoat me and my daughter, Shaye, to push their own lies about how the presidential election was stolen,” Freeman said. “There is nowhere I feel safe, nowhere. Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States target you? The president of the United States is supposed to represent every American, not to target one. He targeted me, lady ruby, a small business owner, mother, proud American citizen. Stood up to help Fulton county run an election in the middle of the pandemic.”\n\nMoss said she “felt horrible for picking this job and being the one that always wants to help, always there, never missing one election. I felt like it was my fault putting my family in the situation.”\n\nThe experience “turned my life upside down. I no longer give out my business card. I don’t transfer calls. I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” she added. “ I second-guess everything that I do. It has affected my life in a major way.”\n\nMoss and her mother have since filed defamation lawsuits against Giuliani and other media outlets who spread misinformation with the video. One of them, against One America News network, was settled in April, AJC reported.\n\nWhen asked by Schiff how many workers remained in their jobs after the 2020 election, Moss responded that no permanent election worker or supervisor was still at their jobs — including her.\n\nBrad Raffensperger\n\nRole: Raffensperger is Georgia’s secretary of state.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? As the top official responsible for elections in Georgia, Raffensperger was responsible for managing the 2020 election in the state, which Biden won by a thin margin. In the months following the election, Raffensperger would come under pressure from Trump to change the outcome of the election, including being told to “find” enough votes to overturn Biden’s victory.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Raffensperger testified June 21.\n\nThe latest: Raffensperger opened his testimony before the Jan. 6 Committee on June 21 by saying he believed the Georgia election went “remarkably smooth,” while the aftermath was anything but.\n\nWith Trump losing by a narrow margin, he asked for a recount in Georgia, which he also lost. He then began making baseless allegations of voter fraud.\n\nRaffensperger said his office did “nearly 300” investigations into voter fraud but did not find evidence of substantial ballot tampering.\n\n“They said there was over 66,000 underage voters. We found there is zero…They said there were 2,000 non registered voters. There were zero. They said there were over 2,056 felons, we identified 74 or less,” Raffensperger said of his efforts to look into baseless allegations made by Trump and his allies.\n\n“Every single allegation we checked. We ran down the rabbit trail to make sure our numbers were accurate.”\n\nRaffensperger also testified about how as part of the pressure campaign following the election, Trump called him to “find” 11,780 votes to swing the election in his favor.\n\n“What I knew is we did not have any votes to find. We investigated. There were no votes to find. That was an accurate count that had been certified,” Raffensperger said.\n\nHis wife’s cell phone was also doxed and both of them got threats and pressure from strangers. His son’s widow’s home was broken into. When asked why he didn’t quit, Raffensperger said he “had to be faithful to the constitution.”\n\nTrump continued the pressure.\n\nGabriel Sterling\n\nRole: Sterling is the chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Sterling is a top voting official in Georgia, and helped manage the 2020 presidential election and recount in Georgia, which Trump narrowly lost. As a result, Trump and his allies honed in on the state as an example of their false and unfounded claims of voter fraud.\n\nGeorgia both audited the vote tally and performed a recount of the votes because Biden’s lead was so razor thin. Sterling consistently said his office was taking claims of election law violations seriously, but ultimately the state found no widespread fraud.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Sterling testified June 21.\n\nThe latest: Sterling was the Georgia election official who, in response to Trump’s claims of voter fraud, held a news conference publicly denying the claims, describing the fear and harassment they had caused among blameless election workers and warned that “someone’s going to get killed” if the heated rhetoric over baseless election fraud claims continued.\n\nSterling described to the committee what he called the “straw that broke the camel’s back,” which was a tweet accusing a young contractor with the Dominion voting systems of treason, accompanied by an image of a swinging noose. Sterling was tasked with helping oversee the voting systems that were produced by Dominion Voting Systems, which became the focus of many unfounded conspiracy theories about voter fraud by Trump and his allies.\n\n“For lack of a better word I lost it. I just got irate,” Sterling said, adding that he then used a pre-scheduled press conference on that day to urge Trump to put an end to the fraudulent claims.\n\n“I lost my temper, but it seemed necessary at the time because it was just getting worse,” Sterling said.\n\nHowever, the allegations of election fraud continued. With a new claim that a video depicted Fulton County election workers using “suitcases” to add ballots for Biden to the vote count. Sterling said in an effort to look into the allegations, his office viewed 48 hours of video of the Fulton County count. No evidence of voter fraud was found.\n\n“What it actually showed was Fulton County election workers engaging in normal ballot processes,” Sterling said.\n\nSterling said despite his efforts to debunk claims of election fraud, Trump and his allies continued to make their claims, claims that were believed and repeated by his supporters.\n\n“It was frustrating. Oftentimes I felt our information was getting out, but there was a reticence of people who needed to believe it, to believe it because the president of the United States, who many looked up to and respected, was telling them it wasn’t true despite the facts. I have characterized at some point it was like a shovel trying to empty the ocean with a shovel,” Sterling testified.\n\nLast week, Sterling testified before a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia about Trump’s phone call to the secretary of state.\n\nVirginia ‘Ginni’ Thomas\n\nRole: Thomas is a conservative activist, attorney and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from her? The House panel obtained emails between Ginni Thomas and John Eastman, who was an adviser to former President Donald Trump and a former Supreme Court clerk for Clarence Thomas, the Washington Post reported, citing people “involved in the committee’s investigation.” Eastman was part of the effort to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to block electors and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Post previously reported that Thomas emailed Arizona state lawmakers, asking them to “stand strong in the face of political and media pressure” and “take action to ensure that a clean slate of Electors is chosen.” Thomas also messaged with Mark Meadows, who was the White House chief of staff at the time, about efforts to overturn the election results, according to reporting by the Post and CBS News.\n\nCooperated with the committee? House Jan. 6 Committee Chair Bennie Thompson said after the June 16 hearing that they have sent an invitation to Ginni Thomas to speak with the committee.\n\nPrior to the invitation, Thomas told The Daily Caller, a conservative news outlet, that she “can’t wait to clear up misconceptions. I look forward to talking to them.”\n\nThe latest: Thompson told reporters after Thursday’s hearing that “we have sent Ms. Thomas a letter” inviting her to speak with them.\n\nGreg Jacob\n\nRole: Jacob was the chief counsel to former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? As a top advisor to Pence, Jacob was part of the effort to rebut legal arguments given to, and later cited by, Trump, that the vice president could change the way Electoral College votes were counted, thereby changing the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nJacob disputed a memo from John Eastman, a lawyer affiliated with the conservative Claremont Institute, who argued Pence could refuse to accept the electoral votes from certain states and described the vice president as the “ultimate arbiter” of how the electoral votes would be counted.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. He has given statements to the Jan. 6 committee and testified publicly on June 16, along with conservative former Judge J. Michael Luttig.\n\nThe latest: The bulk of the June 16 hearing focused on Jacob’s testimony, which outlined the steps Eastman and Trump took in the days leading up to the insurrection to keep the president in power.\n\nJacob testified that Pence first asked him about the legality of rejecting electors in early December of 2020. According to Jacob, Pence could not believe it would be legal, so Jacob drafted a memo explaining it was not.\n\n“The vice president’s first instinct when he heard this theory was that there was no way our framers who abhorred concentrated power, who had broken away from the tyranny of George III, would have ever put one person, particularly not a person who had a direct interest in the outcome because they were on the ticket for the election, in a role to have decisive impact on the outcome of the election,” Jacob said.\n\n“Our review of text, history, and frankly just common sense all confirmed the vice president’s first instinct on that point. There is no justifiable basis to conclude the vice president has that kind of authority,” Jacob testified.\n\nOn Jan 4. and Jan. 5, Jacob had several conversations with Eastman, as well as Trump and Pence chief of staff Marc Short, in which Eastman pushed the theory that Pence could either reject electors outright or delay certification for 10 days, giving state legislatures time to send Trump-friendly electors for a later vote count. Jacob was not swayed and worked to convince Eastman that his suggestions weren’t constitutional.\n\n“The vice president never budged from the position that I have described as his first instinct,” Jacob testified.\n\nThe morning of Jan. 6, as Jacob and others polished Pence’s statement that he could not overturn the results of the election, Jacob said Pence received a phone call from the president. Though Pence stepped out to take it, the committee played testimony from others who heard Trump’s side of the call, including the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump. They described it as heated, and said Trump used vulgar language to describe Pence.\n\nJacob also detailed Pence’s actions on Jan. 6, noting that the vice president was taken to a secure location as rioters stormed the building but never left the Capitol.\n\n“The vice president did not want to take any chance that the world would see the vice president of the United States fleeing the U.S. Capitol. He was determined that we would complete the work that we had set out to do that day, that it was his constitutional duty to see it through,” Jacob said.\n\nJacob also said that Pence and his wife were frustrated that Trump never checked on their safety during the riot. And he testified that while they waited in the secure location, he read his Bible, relying on his faith to sustain him.\n\n“Daniel 6 was where I went. And in Daniel 6, Daniel has become the second in command of Babylon, a pagan nation, that he completely, faithfully serves. He refuses an order from the King that he cannot follow, and he does his duty consistent with his oath to God,” Jacob tesfied.\n\n“And I felt that that’s what had played out that day.”\n\nJ. Michael Luttig\n\nRole: Luttig is a former federal judge and conservative legal expert who advised former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Luttig played a key role in supporting Pence as the former vice president refused requests from Trump, under the advice of conservative Claremont Institute lawyer John Eastman, to reject the results of the 2020 elections, CNN has reported.\n\nAccording to a memo obtained by journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, Eastman reportedly told Trump that Pence could simply refuse to certify the electors sent by the states, thus throwing the selection of electoral votes to House of Representative state delegations that were dominated by Republicans who supported Trump.\n\n“The fact is that the Constitution assigns this power to the Vice President as the ultimate arbiter. We should take all of our actions with that in mind,” Eastman wrote in the memo.\n\nAccording to CNN, Pence’s personal lawyer, Richard Cullen, contacted Luttig asking him to provide a legal argument to rebut Eastman, who had once been Luttig’s clerk.\n\nLuttig published a Tweet thread the day before the insurrection on whether Pence as vice president had the ability to change the way Electoral College votes were counted. Luttig concluded that Pence did not.\n\n“The only responsibility and power of the Vice President under the Constitution is to faithfully count the electoral college votes as they have been cast,” Luttig wrote.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Luttig was one of two witnesses in the committee’s June 16 hearing.\n\nThe latest: In his testimony at the June 16 hearing, Luttig explained that in his opinion, the theory that the vice president had any power in overturning the result of the election during Congress’ official count of electoral votes was not only wrong, but also dangerous.\n\n“The declaration of Donald Trump as the next president would have plunged America into what I believe would have been tantamount to a revolution within a constitutional crisis in America,” Luttig told the committee.\n\nHe described in thorough detail the constitutional basis for the vice president counting the electoral votes on Jan. 6, and said that in his view, the text is “pristine clear.”\n\n“There was no basis in the constitution or laws of the United States at all for the theory espoused by Mr. Eastman. At all. None,” Luttig said.\n\nHe also said that on Jan. 6, the vice president had “little substantive constitutional authority, if any at all” over Congress’ proceedings.\n\nAccording to testimony by Luttig and others, Eastman argued that earlier vice presidents had taken action similar to what Eastman was proposing.\n\nBut Luttig rebuffed the idea that there has been any historical precedent for the vice president rejecting electoral votes, calling that theory the “root of what I have called the blueprint to overturn the 2020 election.”\n\n“I would have laid my body across the road before I would have let the vice president overturn the 2020 election on the basis of that historical precedent,” he said.\n\nIn his final statement, Luttig said he believes Trump and his supporters are a “clear and present danger to American democracy.”\n\nHe said he’s worried that Trump or his “anointed successor” would try to overturn the results of the 2024 election should they not win.\n\n“I do not speak these words lightly. I would have never spoken these words ever in my life, except that’s what the former president and his allies are telling us,” he said.\n\nJohn Eastman\n\nRole: Eastman was a legal advisor for Trump and a founding director of the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, a law firm that is part of the conservative think tank The Claremont Institute. He also previously clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Eastman was critical to perpetuating the myth that there were legal pathways to overturn the 2020 election. In December, he filed a brief on Trump’s behalf in a Texas lawsuit challenging Biden’s win before the Supreme Court. The court threw the case out, but Eastman kept up his efforts, including circulating a series of memos espousing the theory that the vice president is “the ultimate arbiter” of the election and had the power to delay Congress’ count of Electoral College votes.\n\nIn the days leading up to Jan. 6, he tried to convince Pence and his lawyer Greg Jacob of his legal theory, and spoke alongside Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani at Trump’s Jan. 6 rally before rioters headed toward the Capitol.\n\nCooperated with the committee? The committee subpoenaed Eastman, and he testified in closed-door interviews. However, he invoked 5th Amendment protections against self-incrimination for 100 questions, committee Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said at the June 16 hearing.\n\nHe also initially refused to turn over a trove of documents the committee requested. He released them after a judge ordered him to do so.\n\nThe latest: During the June 16 hearing, Jacob and retired conservative Judge J. Michael Luttig repeatedly dismantled Eastman’s theory that the vice president has the Constitutional authority to reject states’ slates of electors or delay the certification of votes at all.\n\nJacob explained that in the days leading up to Jan. 6, Eastman presented two paths for how Pence could keep Trump in power. He could outright reject the electors and their votes or he could delay the certification for 10 days, which would give state legislatures time to send Trump-friendly electors for a later vote count.\n\nBoth Jacob and Luttig testified before the committee that both avenues were illegal, and Jacob said Pence never considered either option. Aguilar also showed an October memo in which Eastman himself noted that those pathways were not legal.\n\nJacob testified that Eastman switched back and forth over which route he recommended, noting that the second might be more “politically palatable,” and insisted the 10 days would be time to get public acceptance for the move.\n\nDespite Pence never entertaining Eastman’s suggestions, Eastman pushed the issue numerous times up through Jan. 6. After the insurrection, which delayed the count beyond what is technically called for in the Electoral Count Act, Eastman tried at least once more to convince the vice president to delay the certification.\n\n“Now that we have established that the Electoral Count Act is not so sacrosanct as you have made it out to be, I implore you to consider one more relatively minor violation and adjourn for 10 days to allow the legislatures to finish their investigations,” he emailed Pence.\n\nDays later, Eastman emailed Trump lawyer Rudy Guiliani asking to be placed on a potential presidential pardon list, the committee revealed, though he ultimately was not.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that Eastman had exchanged emails about tactics to overturn the election with conservative activist Ginni Thomas, who is also the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nBJay Pak\n\nRole: Pak is the former U.S. Attorney General for the Northern District of Georgia\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Georgia, where Pak was U.S. Attorney General, was one of the states in which the Trump campaign falsely claimed it saw substantial voter fraud.\n\nThe committee first spoke to Pak in August. CNN reported that as part of his testimony, Pak said he stepped down as U.S. Attorney in Atlanta after Trump called Georgia’s secretary of state and tried to pressure him into saying there had been election fraud.\n\nDuring that call, Trump referred to a “never-Trump” official, though he didn’t specifically say Pak’s name.\n\nAfter Pak resigned, Trump appointed a new U.S. Attorney, and Pak said he had confidence in his successor.\n\nAccording to a Senate Judiciary Committee interim staff report, “Pak’s office had investigated and debunked various allegations of election fraud in Georgia” by the time Trump called. The report alleges that Pak had planned to stay in his role until inauguration day and he was “personally very concerned” about Trump’s efforts to overturn the election.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: In Pak’s testimony June 13, he detailed his experience with the Trump campaign’s claims of voter fraud.\n\nHe recalled a particular allegation that an election worker took a suitcase full of votes to the ballot box after hours.\n\nBut Pak explained that those weren’t extra votes, or falsely cast votes — they had previously been accidentally missed. It wasn’t a suitcase, Pak said, but a lockbox full of legitimate votes that needed to be counted.\n\nThe FBI investigated the claim, Pak said, but “determined nothing irregular happened in the counting,” and said the claims were false.\n\nLofgren asked Pak to confirm that there was “no widespread fraud sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the election.”\n\n“That is correct,” Pak said.\n\nAl Schmidt\n\nRole: Schmidt is a former commissioner for the city of Philadelphia.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him?\n\nSchmidt was the only Republican member of Philadelphia’s city commission, which oversees the city’s elections. The city was one of the targets of Trump’s claims of voter fraud.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: Among the false claims of election fraud was the suggestion that 8,000 dead voters cast ballots in Philadelphia. In the committee’s June 13 hearing, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., asked Schmidt about that claim.\n\n“Not only was there not evidence of 8,000 dead voters voting in Pennsylvania, there wasn’t evidence of eight,” Schmidt said. “We took seriously every case that was referred to us. Nno matter how fantastical or how absurd, we took every one of them seriously, even these.”\n\nSchmidt also provided redacted threats he received after Trump tweeted about him, saying Schmidt refused to investigate “a mountain of corruption.”\n\nThe threats had been general in nature before Trump’s tweet, Schmidt said.After the tweet, they were highly specific and incredibly threatening, he added.\n\n“The threats became much more specific, much more graphic, and included not just me by name, but included members of my family, by name, ages, our address, pictures of our home – every bit of detail you can imagine,” Schmidt said.\n\nChris Stirewalt\n\nRole: Stirewalt is a former Fox News political editor.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Stirewalt was fired in the aftermath of conservative backlash to Fox News correctly calling Arizona for Biden in the 2020 election. Stirewalt is now the political editor for NewsNation. Stirewalt is now the political editor for NewsNation.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: Stirewalt recalled for the committee June 13 the decision to call Arizona for Trump earlier than other networks.\n\n“We already knew that Trump’s chances were very small and getting smaller, based on what we had seen,” Stirewalt said. “So we were able to make the call early. We were able to beat the competition.”\n\nThe committee asked Stirewalt to explain the “red mirage” that was both expected and then present on election night.\n\nHe explained that early results are typically expected to be positive for Republicans, but when mail-in votes are counted, the lead can shrink or disappear.\n\n“The Trump campaign and the president had made it clear they were going to try and exploit this anomaly,” Stirewalt testified.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California asked Stirewalt if it should have been expected that Trump’s lead on election night would shrink.\n\n“It happens every time,” Stirewalt said.\n\nFox News did not carry the first Jan. 6 primetime hearings live, unlike every other major broadcast and cable network, and Stirewalt has not attempted to hide his distaste for his former employer.\n\n“They’re not trying to do journalism,” he said on NewsNation, before reframing that. “Well — whatever they’re trying to do, they’re certainly not achieving that. What they’re trying to do is entertain and keep their audience and move the product.”\n\nAt the June 13 hearing, he stood by his team at Fox News and their reporting on election night.\n\n“Our decision desk was the best in the business, and I was very proud to be a part of it,” he said.\n\nBill Stepien\n\nRole: Stepien is Trump’s former campaign manager.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him?\n\nAs a Trump campaign manager, Stepien was intimately involved with communicating how the former president was faring in states across the country, in the months leading up to Election Day and on election night.\n\nIn its subpoena to Stepien, the committee indicated it was particularly interested in his involvement in Trump’s “Stop the Steal” campaign that promoted the false claim there were voting machine inaccuracies during the 2020 election, messaging that was repeated by rioters who attacked the Capitol. The campaign built fundraising around those false claims despite internal memos that acknowledged that they were false. The committee also accused the campaign of asking states to delay or deny the election results.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. He testified in closed-door hearings when subpoenaed.\n\nThe latest: An hour before the hearing began, the committee said Stepien would no longer testify in person, citing a family emergency. When the hearing began, Cheney said Stepien’s wife went into labor.\n\nThe committee played some excerpts of Stepien’s recorded video testimony, in which Stepien said he repeatedly told Trump the truth about losing the election and the lack of evidence of voter fraud.\n\nStepien said on election night, he thought the Trump campaign should acknowledge votes were still being counted and say it was too early to make a call. Instead, the president made a speech alleging massive voter fraud, without evidence, and claiming he won the election.\n\n“It was far too early to be making any calls like that,” Stepien recalled thinking.\n\nHe also testified that in the days after the election, he told Trump that his chances were “very, very, very bleak,” and said he was frustrated that some of Trump’s advisers were feeding him false information about fraud.\n\n“I didn’t think what was happening was necessarily honest or professional at that point. That led to me stepping away,” Stepien said.\n\nIn contrast to those falsely claiming fraud, “I didn’t mind being categorized as being part of team normal,” Stepien said.\n\nBen Ginsberg\n\nRole: Ginsberg is a conservative elections lawyer best known for his involvement in the 2000 recount of the presidential race between Al Gore and George W. Bush.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Ginsberg counseled the Bush-Cheney presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004, and co-chaired the bipartisan Presidential Commission on Election Administration.\n\nThroughout the 2020 race, and after the election, he persistently fought Trump’s false claims of election fraud.\n\nIn the days following the 2020 election, Ginsberg told the PBS NewsHour’s Judy Woodruff that Trump “is alleging fraudulent elections and rigged results that there is no evidence for.”\n\n“Those were allegations that were made before this election, based on past elections, with absolutely no proof of that,” Ginsberg added.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: At the committee hearing, Lofgren questioned Ginsberg about the 62 lawsuits the Trump campaign filed, claiming election fraud, asking if the campaign effectively made its case.\n\n“I’ve looked at the more than 60 [cases] that include more than 180 counts and no. The simple fact is that the Trump campaign did not make its case,” Ginsberg said.\n\nHe also noted there were post-election reviews, and “in each one of those instances there was no credible evidence of fraud produced by the Trump campaign or his supporters.”\n\nBill Barr\n\nRole: Barr was the Trump administration’s attorney general at the time of the 2020 election.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Barr was in Trump’s inner circle in both the run-up to the election and the immediate aftermath, and played a key role in public communications about the legitimacy of the election.\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Barr regularly referred to unfounded worries about election interference or fraud. In July 2020, he claimed there was “a high risk” of “massive” fraud from mail-in voting, though he also said he had “no reason to think” the election would be rigged. And he speculated without evidence that a “foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots.”\n\nBut after Trump lost the election, Barr said publicly his office had seen no evidence of voter fraud, and he stepped down as attorney general before the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nWATCH: Barr, Ivanka Trump say they knew there was no voter fraud in 2020 election\n\nCooperated with the committee: Yes.\n\nThe latest: During the first night of hearings on June 9, the committee showed footage of Barr’s closed-door testimony, in which he said he told Trump there was no merit to claims of fraud. Barr also said the false claims of election fraud are what prompted him to resign.\n\nLater in the hearing, the committee showed part of a closed-door interview with former first daughter Ivanka Trump, who confirmed that Barr had told her there was no evidence of election fraud, and that she had believed him.\n\nBarr, his refusal to publicly claim election fraud and his exit from office, is expected to be the theme of the committee’s third hearing June 15. Cheney said in her opening statement that the June 13 hearing will lay out that Trump “corruptly planned to replace the Attorney General of the United States so the U.S. Justice Department would spread his false stolen election claims.”\n\nCaroline Edwards\n\nRole: Capitol police officer present at Jan. 6 riot\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from her? According to a statement issued by the Jan. 6 Committee, Edwards was the first law enforcement officer injured by rioters who attacked the Capitol, leaving her with a brain injury. Though injured, she continued to patrol the Capitol and prevented more rioters from entering the building.\n\nEdwards testified before the committee during its first hearing on June 9. She detailed her injuries for the committee, and the work she did despite those injuries to protect parts of the Capitol from rioters.\n\n“What I saw was just a war scene. It was something like I had seen out of the movies. I couldn’t believe my eyes. There were officers on the ground. You know, they were bleeding. They were throwing up,” Edwards said.\n\nEdwards was a four-year veteran of the U.S. Capitol Police when the Jan. 6 attack took place, according to USA Today. However, she told the committee nothing in her training would have prepared her for the events of that day.\n\n“Never in my wildest dreams did I think that as a police officer, as a law enforcement officer, I would find myself in the middle of a battle. You know, I’m trained to detain, you know, a couple of subjects and handle a crowd. But I’m not combat trained,” she said.\n\nEdwards also recounted her confrontation on the Capitol steps with members of the Proud Boys who she witnessed confer among themselves before attacking a police barricade made of bike racks. She worked to keep the Proud Boys contained next to the bike racks. Though she knew she did not have the strength to stop them, she hoped to delay them long enough for more police to arrive for back up. As the barricade was forced forward, she fell backward and was knocked unconscious.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes\n\nThe latest: Edwards testified before the Jan. 6 Committee on June 9. Members of the committee are able to ask her written follow-up questions within ten days of her appearance.\n\nNick Quested\n\nRole: Documentary filmmaker who captured parts of the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? According to the committee, Quested and his crew were at the Capitol on Jan. 6, during which they “documented the movements around the Capitol that morning, the first moments of violence against U.S. Capitol Police, and the chaos that ensued.”\n\nQuested was one of two people who testified during the first hearing of the Jan. 6 Committee.\n\nQuested and his crew had been documenting the extremist group the Proud Boys, including their then-leader Henry “Enrique” Tarrio. That included following members as they traveled to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6. Quested and his crew documented the activity around the Capitol that morning and some of the first moments of violence, including against Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards, who also testified in the June 9 hearing.\n\nThat footage was featured as part of the committee’s hearing.\n\nQuested outlined publicly to the committee what he saw that week, starting with a meeting between Tarrio and Elmer “Stewart” Rhodes, the founder and leader of the extremist group the Oath Keepers, the night before the insurrection.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, Quested said he and his team had met up with the Proud Boys to continue filming them.\n\n“They started to walk towards the Capitol. There was a large contingent. More than I had expected,” Quested said, noting that the Proud Boys already began to walk towards the Capitol before former President Donald Trump’s speech by the Ellipse behind the White House ended.\n\n“I was confused to a certain extent while we were walking away from the president’s speech. Because that is what I felt we were there to cover,” Quested said.\n\n“I make efforts to create familiarity between myself and my subjects to make them feel comfortable. And the atmosphere was much darker than it had been in these other days,” Quested said.\n\nTarrio was not in D.C. on the day of the attack, but helped guide activities from afar, the Justice Department said. Tarrio and some of the group’s other leaders were indicted on federal seditious conspiracy charges earlier this week.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. In addition to providing testimony, he also handed over footage to the committee after being issued with a Congressional subpoena.\n\nThe latest: Quested was one of two of the first witnesses to testify at the first public hearing of the committee.\n\nPeter Navarro\n\nRole: Navarro was an economic adviser to Trump at the time of the attack.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? In December 2020, Navarro produced a report in which he falsely claimed he had enough evidence to prove Trump won the 2020 election. In a letter requesting Navarro’s testimony, the House select committee said he “worked with [Trump adviser] Steve Bannon and others to develop and implement a plan to delay Congress’s certification of, and ultimately change the outcome of, the November 2020 presidential election.”\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Navarro has said he didn’t advocate for the violence on Jan. 6. Instead, part of the plan would have involved former Vice President Mike Pence rejecting Biden’s electors during that day’s joint session of Congress.\n\nIn his book, “In Trump Time,” Navarro says he’d hope to “put certification of the election on ice” to give Congress and state legislatures time to “investigate all of the fraud and election irregularities.” There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nCooperated with the committee: No\n\nThe latest: Navarro on June 17 pleaded not guilty to two counts of criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to appear at a March 2 deposition for the House committee. He also refused to produce “documents and information” they’ve requested.\n\nIn April, the House voted along near-party lines to hold Navarro in contempt of Congress and recommended criminal charges. On June 3, he was indicted by the Department of Justice. At the time, Navarro promised to fight the charges and denied their legitimacy.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Navarro said he was filing a civil suit saying the Jan. 6 committee’s work was unlawful and was intended to have “the Supreme Court address a number of issues that have come with the weaponization of Congress’ investigatory powers” since the Trump administration was in office.\n\nBannon was also indicted on contempt charges in November.\n\nSteve Bannon\n\nRole: Bannon was an adviser to Trump. While he was not employed by the White House in 2021, he remained a close ally.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? The committee says Bannon was communicating with Trump in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol, encouraging Trump to focus on Jan. 6. It also says Bannon met separately with members of Congress the day before the attack, encouraging them to vote against the certification of election results.\n\nBannon was among the first officials subpoenaed by the House committee last September. He refused to comply with the request for an interview and documents, claiming his communications with Trump are protected by executive privilege– the right for certain communications between the president and people in the executive branch to remain confidential. In November, the Justice Department indicted Bannon on two federal charges of contempt of Congress. His trial is scheduled for July.\n\nBannon has claimed he was following the advice of his lawyers in not cooperating with the committee, and did not know he was breaking the law.\n\nCooperated with the committee: No.\n\nThe latest: Bannon’s lawyers have filed their own legal challenge related to Jan. 6, questioning whether the House committee investigating the attack was properly formed under the chamber’s rules.\n\nThe week of June 6, Bannon’s lawyers subpoenaed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and all of the committee’s members to question them under oath about the creation of the committee, which was initially supposed to have 13 members, according to its founding resolution. Last summer, Pelosi objected to committee members selected by the GOP, saying they would not be able to properly investigate the attack, angering House conservatives. The committee’s final nine members, all selected by Pelosi, includes seven Democrats and two Republicans.\n\nMark Meadows\n\nRole: Meadows was Trump’s chief of staff at the time of the attack.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? As Trump’s chief of staff, Meadows was intimately involved in the former president’s communications and actions in his final months in office, as Trump tried to cast the 2020 elections as fraudulent.\n\nIn April, CNN published thousands of text messages between Meadows and various members of congress, lawyers and other Trump allies, before and after the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nSome in the run-up to the insurrection focused largely on the false conspiracy theory that the election was invalid, and efforts to stop the certification of results. .\n\nOn the day of the insurrection, Meadows responded to an earlier text from Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, in which the congressman pushed for Pence to reject electoral votes Jordan thought were unconstitutional. In reply, Meadows said, “I have pushed for this. Not sure it is going to happen[.]”\n\nOthers captured pleas from lawmakers and allies for Meadows to encourage the president to do something to stop the violence.\n\nAccording to news reports, Meadows aide Cassidy Hutchinson has testified to Congressional investigators that Meadows had been warned prior to Jan. 6 that the pro-Trump demonstrations may turn violent.\n\nCooperated with the committee: Sometimes.\n\nMembers of the committee have said that Meadows sometimes cooperated with their investigation. He provided some documents like text messages and emails, but in December, stopped cooperating.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/nyregion/trump-ny-fraud-trial-testimony.html', 'Headline': '5 Things We Learned During Trump’s Trial Testimony - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'Mr. Trump is voluble, even explosive, in his off-the-cuff speech, and Justice Engoron had difficulty controlling the former president on the witness stand.

NPR\'s Andrea Bernstein is here to talk about the overall case and what\'s coming next. Hey there.\n\nANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.\n\nSHAPIRO: So to recap, Trump was supposed to testify this week, and he changed his mind at the last minute, said he wasn\'t coming. So how did the case end up?\n\nBERNSTEIN: With a battle of the expert witnesses. Trump\'s final witness was an accounting professor at New York University who said he saw no accounting fraud in Trump\'s financial statements. So the AG put on a rebuttal witness, an accounting professor from another prestigious New York school, Cornell University, to say, wait a minute, that\'s not how it\'s done. The professor, Eric Lewis, testified that Trump had not followed the rules when it came to valuing his properties. Lewis wasn\'t five minutes into his testimony before Trump lawyer Charles Kise (ph) started objecting very strenuously, which prompted the assistant attorney general, Kevin Wallace, to erupt - referring to the professor - he\'s been qualified as an expert. Kise said, not in the real world. Wallace said, he is out of order. And that\'s kind of how the case ended up.\n\nSHAPIRO: Sounds like a lot of drama in the courtroom. Was that pretty typical of how the last 10 weeks of testimony have gone?\n\nBERNSTEIN: Yeah. So the differences in the way the parties see the facts got pretty heated at times. The AG\'s theory is that Trump lied and lied about the value of his assets, that he fudged the books, and that a result - as a result of that lying, Trump made hundreds of millions of dollars that he shouldn\'t have made. And the judge has partially endorsed that theory. Even before the trial began, he issued a ruling saying the AG had proven persistent and repeated fraud. So the trial was really about the issue of intent and how much in ill-gotten gains Trump will have to pay back to the state. For its part, the defense argued no one was harmed. The main bank involved in all of this, Deutsche Bank, wanted Trump as a client in its private wealth division and was willing to give him great loan rates and that Trump properties are, well, all spectacular and able to command top dollar.\n\nSHAPIRO: All throughout this trial, Trump has had a running commentary outside of the courtroom. Has that affected what\'s going on inside the court?\n\nBERNSTEIN: Inside the courtroom, which he visited nine times, Trump had to be quiet, to rise when the bailiff yelled, all rise. He had to sit through - one of his attorneys said at the outset would be, quote, ""excruciating detail."" She made good on that, by the way. Donald Trump did testify vociferously as part of the AG\'s case, but he seemed to be getting the most energy from these quick hallway scrums he held outside the courtroom where he called the trial rigged and the judge biased - pre-butting (ph) a possible bad verdict. It\'s kind of like how he said the 2020 election was going to be rigged before balloting had even started.\n\nSHAPIRO: So when are we going to see the verdict?\n\nBERNSTEIN: The judge asked for legal briefs January 5. The briefs will be argued January 11, and then there will be a verdict sometime in the weeks after that. For context, the Iowa caucus is January 15. The New Hampshire primary is January 23. So sometime around then.\n\nSHAPIRO: That\'s NPR\'s Andrea Bernstein. Thanks.\n\nBERNSTEIN: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL CAESAR SONG, ""DO YOU LIKE ME?"")\n\nCopyright © 2023 NPR.

Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse in the 2020 election inquiry.\n\nSmith was charged with investigating any violations of the law in connection with efforts to “interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote” on Jan. 6, “as well as any matters that arose or might arise directly from this investigation.”\n\nBringing charges against Trump in connection with his speech at the Ellipse before the Capitol attack on Jan. 6 was always going to pose a challenge. Trump’s words are protected by the First Amendment, and his rhetoric — telling the people in the crowd they were “not going to have a country anymore” if they didn’t “fight like hell” — could fit within the realm of heated political rhetoric. Trump also explicitly told the crowd to march “peacefully,” which would make charges even more difficult.\n\nInstead, Smith’s team has investigated areas where there might be a clearer instance of potentially illegal conduct. The witnesses called indicate that the special counsel probe has focused particularly on the “fake electors“ scheme in which false slates of electors from states Trump lost would assert that he won. In total, 84 fake electors in seven swing states signed documents falsely declaring Trump the winner.\n\nReporters and producers regularly camp out in the courthouse lobby, watching the staircase and the elevators, trying to spot witnesses entering the grand jury area. Over the course of several months, the Washington residents sitting on the grand jury have heard testimony from witnesses ranging from little-known campaign aides to Secret Service agents to the former vice president of the United States.\n\nMike Pence, the highest profile witness to appear before the grand jury, testified in late April after a court order to comply with a subpoena, NBC News reported, just over a month before he announced he was challenging Trump for president in 2024. Two of Pence’s aides who were with him at the Capitol on Jan. 6 also testified before a grand jury last summer, before Smith’s appointment. Pence’s former chief of staff Marc Short appeared in July 2022, according to a source familiar with his testimony, and several news outlets reported that Greg Jacob, Pence’s counsel, testified as well; he declined to comment.\n\nLast month, NBC News reported that two of the “fake electors” appeared before the Washington grand jury; their testimony came the same day that Trump made his first court appearance in Miami.\n\nGary Michael Brown, the former deputy director of Election Day operations for the Trump campaign, also testified before the federal grand jury on June 22 and declined to comment to NBC News outside the courthouse. The Jan. 6 committee said last year it had found evidence that Brown was “aware of, and participated in, efforts to promote unsupported allegations of fraud in the November 2020 Presidential election and encourage state legislators to alter the outcome of the November 2020 election by, among other things, appointing alternate slates of electors to send competing electoral votes to the United States Congress.” The committee obtained a text message Brown sent to other Trump campaign officials after he delivered the fake votes to Congress the day before the Jan. 6 attack, which included a selfie of him in front of the Capitol.\n\nThe investigation began in earnest last year, around the time federal law enforcement officials with the Justice Department’s Inspector General’s Office searched the home of Jeffrey Clark, a former DOJ official whom Trump considered making the acting attorney general despite his lack of any experience in criminal law. Court documents revealed that agents were at Clark’s home investigating potential charges of making false statements, criminal conspiracy and obstruction of justice.\n\nFederal agents also seized phones from four key promoters of Trump’s stolen election claims: MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who had his phone seized in a Hardee’s drive-thru; John Eastman, the Trump-aligned lawyer who pushed the discredited theory that Pence had the power to refuse to certify the election; Boris Epshteyn, a longtime Trump adviser who was part of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s legal efforts to overturn the election results; and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., who helped connect the White House with Clark.\n\nIn September 2022, before Smith took over the investigation, the Justice Department issued about 40 subpoenas, including to former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, who also worked with Giuliani’s legal team, and Epshteyn, who recently met with the special counsel for two days, ABC News reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Epshteyn did not respond to a request for comment on his reported appearance.\n\nAfter Smith took over in November, his team subpoenaed officials in Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Pennsylvania, asking them for communications with or involving Trump, his campaign and 19 Trump associates, including Eastman, Giuliani, Justin Clark, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis.\n\nGiuliani spoke with members of Smith’s special counsel team in recent weeks, as CNN first reported. Robert Costello, Giuliani’s attorney, did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment, but a spokesman, Ted Goodman, confirmed that Giuliani and Costello had met with Smith’s team on an “entirely voluntary” basis.\n\nOther individuals who have testified before the federal grand jury, received subpoenas, or spoken to investigators about Jan. 6 and efforts to stop the peaceful transfer of power include:\n\nFormer White House lawyers Patrick Philbin and Pat Cipollone, who were scheduled to testify in September and were spotted at the courthouse in December. Both men testified before the Jan. 6 committee, saying they had opposed Eastman’s plan to have Pence refuse to certify the election because it was not legal.\n\nFormer Trump White House officials Stephen Miller and Dan Scavino, who was seen leaving the courthouse on May 2.\n\nFormer Department of Homeland Security official Ken Cuccinelli, who told NBC News he had testified, and former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, according to an ABC News article that cited sources familiar with the matter. A Ratcliffe spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment seeking to confirm Ratcliffe’s appearance before the grand jury.\n\n“Stop the Steal” leader Ali Alexander, whose group organized the rally that preceded the Capitol attack on Jan. 6. Alexander confirmed on social media last June that he’d testified before a federal grand jury.\n\nFormer Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, according to CNN.

Eventually, the judge stropped trying to control Trump – he and the attorney general’s lawyer questioning Trump let him rant, and then mostly disregarded the missives.\n\nThe high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. Engoron has already ruled Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The New York attorney general’s office said they will rest their case after Ivanka Trump’s testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand:\n\nTrump’s campaign comes to the courtroom: The former president’s rhetoric at times during his testimony might as well have been at one of his rallies in front of supporters. He went after the attorney general. The judge. And the “political witch hunt” that he’s been railing against for years now. On the witness stand, the charged rhetoric was even more remarkable, as he attacked the judge sitting right next to him, with James in the courtroom watching his testimony just feet away. “The fraud is on the court, not on me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump gets an angry response from the judge: Judge Engoron tried at the outset of Trump’s testimony to stop the former president from making speeches and instead answer the questions, but it did little to change Trump’s approach. The judge responded by threatening to remove Trump from the witness stand, though that didn’t deter the former president either. “This is not a political rally,” Engoron said to Trump, telling Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise to “control your client.”\n\nTrump acknowledges changing valuation of Trump Tower triplex: The attorney general’s office pressed Trump on the properties central to his identity and brand: Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and other key parts of his real estate empire. The AG’s office attorney Kevin Wallace also pressed Trump on why valuations of properties were changed, such as his Trump Tower triplex, which was devalued on his financial statement in 2017 after a Forbes article found he had dramatically exaggerated the size of the apartment. Trump acknowledged there had on occasion been mistakes, such as the Trump Tower apartment valuation.\n\nTrump’s descriptions of his properties: The former president’s rhetorical flourishes went beyond attacking those who are investigating him. He also took the opportunity to play salesman and play up his properties. One of his chief complaints about the judge is a citation in his decision that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18 million, a number based on Florida tax appraisal records “It’s much more valuable,” Trump said of Mar-a-Lago, “and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes, that it’s biggest value is using it as a club.” Wallace took the answer to pin him down on that valuation. “You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” Wallace asked. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here.\n\nTrump on whether he maintained accurate records from August 2014 onward: ""I hope so""\n\nWhen asked by the Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office whether he “maintained accurate books and records” from August 2014 going forward, Donald Trump said “I hope so.”\n\n“I hope so, I didn’t keep them myself. I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nJudge interrupts Trump\'s ""irrelevant"" answer to questions about Scotland golf course valuation\n\nAs testimony began centering on the valuation of Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland — Trump lobbed an answer that Judge Arthur Engoron audibly deemed “irrelevant” to the question.\n\nThe New York assistant attorney general asked Trump if the description in his 2014 financial statement was accurate for the property — which followed by Trump touting Aberdeen as a oil capitol making the property more valuable.\n\n“Irrelevant, irrelevant, answer the question,” Engoron said speaking over Trump, one of the few times that’s happened since returning from the break.\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to boast about the course.\n\nAs Trump gave a long-winded answer about the beauty of the course, Engoron said he would be following the assistant attorney general’s lead: “If you want to let the witness ramble on, non responsive, repeat himself.”\n\nThe assistant attorney general was trying, unsuccessfully, to get Trump to acknowledge a discrepancy on the number of properties that could be built in Aberdeen.\n\n“It’s sort of like a painting. You can do pretty much what you want to do. The land is there and you can do what you want to do,” Trump said.\n\nTrump questioned about the value of Mar-a-Lago\n\nDonald Trump says he believes Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\n“You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” asked Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nThe valuation of Mar-a-Lago has been one of Trump’s complaints about the judge in the trial, after the judge cited a Florida tax appraisal of $18 million for the property in his decision finding Trump, his adult sons and his company committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nWallace asked Trump if he approved of valuing Mar-a-Lago as if it would be sold to an individual as a resident. “Did I approve it on this? I don’t know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump replied, “I don’t remember that, no” when asked if he explicitly told former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg or former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney to value the property that way.\n\nWallace confronted Trump with a 2002 deed of development rights that shows Trump deeded away his right to use the property as anything other than a social club.\n\nTrump then gave a long aside about Mar-a-Lago when Wallace asked him about not being able to use it as anything but a social club.\n\n“I don’t mind leaving it as a club. In fact, if somebody wanted it, smartest thing to do, have a club and have one member and that would be the member that lives in the club. But it’s much more valuable — and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes — that its biggest value is using it as a club,” Trump said.\n\nWallace showed Trump a 2003 article in which the former president told a reporter Mar-A-Lago will always be a club.\n\n“I think that was said with bravado more than legal intent,” Trump said on the stand.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nWhat the scene is like inside the courtroom as Trump takes the stand\n\nIt was an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump took the witness stand a bit ago in New York. The former president slowly climbed a couple of steps into the box and raised his hand to take the oath.\n\nFormer presidents are typically surrounded by a force-field of deference, due to their status and are accompanied everywhere by Secret Service agents.\n\nBut Trump, in a blue suit, shirt and blue tie rather than his typical campaign uniform of white shirt and red tie, is sitting in the witness box alone in a leather chair, with wood panels on either side. His hands are clasped in his lap, and a large bottle of water and two smaller ones are to his left beside a screen allowing him to see court documents.\n\nThis is a civil trial rather than a criminal one. And the American people can’t see it because it’s not televised. But this the moment when the reality of the 2024 campaign hit home. Trump is simultaneously a multiple defendant, as well as being the Republican front-runner and potential next US president.\n\nThis is the most extraordinary campaign in modern history in microcosm.\n\nTrump says he would on occasion make suggestions on financial docs at heart of the trial\n\nFurther questioning in today’s civil fraud trial turned toward the financial documents at the heart of the trial, with Donald Trump saying he would look at financial statements, and on occasion make suggestions.\n\nTrump says of his statements of financial condition, “I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions.”\n\nThe former president says that bankers didn’t pay much attention to his financial statements, and says that is going to be part of their defense.\n\n“We’ll explain that as this trial goes along. This crazy trial goes along. Because we’re bringing in the bankers. Very big bankers,” Trump says. “They will explain exactly what their process is.”\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to. They looked at the deal,” he testified.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nJudge overseeing Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order on Friday\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order in the trial to extend to Trump’s attorneys after they raised multiple questions about the judge’s communications with his law clerk.\n\nIn a written order Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron prohibited Trump’s attorneys from making any further comments about confidential communications between the judge and his staff inside or outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe judge said violating the order would result in “serious sanctions.”\n\nAnalysis: Trump heads to the witness stand as the latest polls show him leaping past Biden in key swing states\n\nA year away from Election Day 2024, former President Donald Trump is set to testify in a civil fraud trial and separately faces more than 90 criminal charges, setting up the possibility that a convicted felon tops the Republican ticket next November.\n\nBut it’s President Joe Biden’s political prospects that are plunging.\n\nIn another extraordinary twist to a 2024 campaign season that is more notable for court hearings than treks through early voting states, Trump is expected to be called to the witness stand in New York on Monday. This is hardly typical activity during a post-presidency. But Trump was, after all, the most unconventional president.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is absorbing brutal new polls showing him losing to GOP front-runner Trump in multiple key swing states. The numbers will likely ignite panic among Democrats and renew doubts among Americans that the soon-to-be-81-year-old is up to a full second term. If the New York Times/Siena College survey is borne out in 2024, there would be no electoral path to victory for Biden. And an increasingly authoritarian Trump – who is promising a second term of “retribution” – could pull off a White House comeback in spite of sparking a Capitol insurrection with his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020.\n\n“I was concerned before these polls, and I’m concerned now,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“These presidential races over the last couple of terms have been very tight. No one is going to have a runaway election here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, concentration, resources. And so we have our work cut out for us.”\n\nThe coinciding crises facing both Trump and Biden belie the fact that, for all their deficiencies, neither is yet to face a serious challenger from within their parties as they seek the nomination.\n\nBiden’s position is weakening as he tackles cascading global threats such as the war in the Middle East, sheds support over his handling of the economy and sees cracks in the multiracial coalition that first elected him. It also reflects a nation that is divided and disconsolate, and groping for the elusive normality that the president promised three years ago after the pandemic and the historic turbulence of the Trump administration.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nHas a former president ever given testimony in his own civil trial?\n\nWhen Donald Trump takes the stand in his New York civil fraud trial Monday, it won’t be the first time a former president will have given testimony in his own defense in a lawsuit.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did it twice more than a hundred years ago, both when he sued a Michigan newspaper that accused him of being a drunk and later when he was sued by a fellow New York Republican whom Roosevelt had called a corrupt political boss.\n\nRoosevelt won both cases. Trump, by contrast, has already been found liable for fraud by the judge in New York.\n\nThose Roosevelt trials, separated by two years, were each sensational at the time, and they came after Roosevelt’s final campaign for the White House, when he placed second to Democrat Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after splitting with Republicans and running as a Progressive.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is very much still in the arena, and his legal strategy in a slew of civil and criminal cases is tied to his concurrent presidential campaign. He has argued that two gag orders – the one issued against him by a federal judge in Washington, DC, and the other by the civil trial judge in New York – hinder his ability to speak as a candidate.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-trial-testimony-ends-months-fireworks-courtroom-rcna129076', 'Headline': 'Trump trial testimony ends after months of fireworks in and outside ...', 'Snippet': ""The trial started on Oct. 2nd, and there were 44 days of testimony featuring 25 witnesses for the AG's office, ...

Trump\'s team tried to show he did nothing wrong, that the statements were largely accurate and that any mistakes weren\'t his fault. Along the way were plenty of spectacles, with testimony from the former president and his family members, gag orders, fines, angry exchanges and dramatic showdowns.\n\nHere\'s a look at some key moments from the trial.\n\nA former president on the witness stand\n\nWhile Trump abruptly decided not to take the stand in his defense earlier this week, the former president spent a remarkable day on the witness stand as part of the AG\'s case last month, where he repeatedly ripped into James and Engoron.\n\n“I think she’s a political hack,” Trump said of James, also labeling Engoron a “very hostile judge, extremely hostile judge.”\n\nTrump said he was especially upset with Engoron\'s pretrial finding that Trump had committed persistent fraud.\n\n“He ruled against me and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me, nothing about me,” Trump said of Engoron, who has overseen legal disputes between Trump and the attorney general’s office for years.\n\nA spat over Mar-a-Lago\n\nOut of all the fraud claims lodged by the AG, the one that appeared to bother Trump the most was one involving his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe AG\'s office noted that Trump valued Mar-a-Lago at between $426 million and $612 million on his financial statements between 2011 and 2021. The Palm Beach County Assessor, meanwhile, appraised the property\'s market value to be between $18 million and $27 million in the same time period. The AG\'s office also noted the financial statements valued the property as a private home, while Trump had signed an agreement with the county that it could only be used as a social club.\n\nTrump repeatedly complained about the AG citing the tax valuation and Engoron\'s pretrial finding that not disclosing the club restriction was fraudulent. “The judge had it at $18 million. And it is worth, say, I say from 50 to 100 times more than that. So I don’t know how you got those numbers,” Trump testified, adding later that he thinks it\'s actually worth ""between a billion and a billion five.” He\'s also complained about the valuation to reporters in court on the days he\'s attended the trial, at political rallies and on his Truth Social website.\n\nThe second to last defense witness in the case, Palm Beach real estate broker Lawrence Moens, brought a video he shot of the property with him that he played during his testimony. He said he valued the property at over $1 billion, and invited the AG to tour the property in person. ""I’ll make sure he is not there when you come,"" he said, referring to Trump.\n\nTrump was slapped with a gag order, and penalized for defying it\n\nTrump attended several days of the trial, and some of his comments to reporters during breaks came back to bite him. On the second day of trial, Trump referred reporters to a post on his social media platform Truth Social, where he shared the identity of the judge\'s law clerk and falsely accused her of having a personal relationship with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\n“You saw what was just put out about Schumer and the principal clerk? That is disgraceful,” Trump said. The judge ordered the post be removed and issued a gag order barring Trump from talking about his court staff, saying such attacks ""are unacceptable, inappropriate and I won’t tolerate it."" He later fined Trump $5,000 after it was revealed the post was still on a campaign website weeks later and threatened further sanctions, including jail time.\n\nThe judge later expanded the gag order to include Trump\'s lawyers as well. Trump’s attorneys are appealing the gag orders and the fines against their client.\n\nTrump storms out of the courtroom\n\nOn Oct. 25, Engoron fined Trump another $10,000 after finding he told reporters outside the courtroom that Engoron is “a very partisan judge with a person who’s very partisan sitting alongside him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is.”\n\nThe judge took that as a reference to his law clerk, who sits next to him and who Trump had alleged was politically biased against him. He ordered Trump to take the witness stand, and he testified he was referring to that day\'s witness, his former attorney turned outspoken critic Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump has publicly called Cohen all sorts of names since he turned against him, but ""partisan"" has not been one of his insults. The judge said he found Trump\'s testimony ""not credible"" and fined him. ""Don’t do it again, or it will be worse,” Engoron warned.\n\nA short time later, Trump stormed out of the courtroom- seeming to surprise his lawyers and his Secret Service agents.\n\nTrump reunited with an old friend-turned-foe\n\nMichael Cohen\'s testimony was the first time he\'d come face to face with his former boss in five years. James has said she launched her investigation into Trump after Cohen testified about his business practices to the House Oversight Committee on Capitol Hill in 2019.\n\nTrump came to court for Cohen\'s testimony and appeared to be enjoying himself while his attorney Alina Habba got Cohen to acknowledge he\'d lied under oath in a previous court case. Cohen, who said he was involved in preparing some of the financial statements, also said Trump never directly told him to inflate values. Trump used that statement to declare victory in the case to reporters and his lawyers asked the judge to rule in the case in their favor.\n\nUnder further questioning from the AG, Cohen testified it wasn\'t Trump\'s style to make direct requests. He compared Trump to a “mob boss” who tells you what he wants without directly telling you.\n\nFormer accountant blames the Trumps\n\nThe AG\'s first witness was the Trump\'s former accountant, Donald Bender. Bender testified that he compiled the financial statements, called statements of financial condition, using information and valuations provided to him by executives at Trump\'s company, the Trump Organization. He said he relied on company officials, including former CFO Allen Weisselberg and senior vice president Jeff McConney, to provide him with accurate information. Asked at one point if he\'d subsequently learned the company had been holding information back from him, Bender said, “Yes.” He said that they’d failed to turn over “paper documents over a number of years.”\n\nWeisselberg and McConney testified as well. All three had also testified in the Manhattan district attorney\'s criminal tax fraud trial against the Trump Organization last year. The company was convicted and fined and Weisselberg, who pleaded guilty to falsifying business records, was sentenced to five months in jail.\n\nTrump family blames the accountants\n\nThe former president, his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., Weisselberg and other company officials all pointed a finger back at Bender and their other accountants during their testimony.\n\n""All I did is authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary for the accountants to do a statement. In other words, we supplied them with what they needed. And if they didn\'t get it, they wouldn\'t do the statement,"" Trump said.\n\nTrump Jr., who\'s now running the company with his brother, said “I rely on the accountants” for the statements. “They were intimately involved in every aspect” of the statements, he said.\n\nEric Trump said, “I relied on a very big accounting office. I relied on one of the biggest accounting firms in the country. And I relied on a great legal team, and when they gave me comfort that the statement was perfect, I was more than happy to execute it.” He also suggested the statements weren\'t the type of thing he paid much attention to. “I pour concrete. I operate properties. I don’t focus on appraisals,” he said.\n\nIvanka Trump, a former executive at the company, also testified during the AG\'s case and said she was not involved with the statements, but assumed they were documents that ""he would work on with his own accountants.""\n\nTrump accounting expert says \'no evidence\' of fraud\n\nThe final defense witness was Eli Bartov, an accounting professor at NYU. Bartov, who was paid almost $900,000 for his work on the case by Trump\'s company and his political action committee, testified that “my analysis shows the statements of financial condition for all the years were not materially misstated.”\n\n“My main finding is that there is no evidence whatsoever for any accounting fraud,” he said.\n\nThe judge asked him whether his expert opinion from an accounting perspective was that the AG’s claims had no merit. “Absolutely,” he replied.\n\nTrump, who attended the trial on the first day of Bartov\'s testimony, called Bartov “a very strong witness, a very powerful witness and a highly respected person.”\n\nA fond farewell\n\nAt the start of the last day of testimony Wednesday, Engoron said, “In a strange way. I am going to miss this trial. It has been an experience.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/politics/grand-jury-testimony-list-january-6-trump/index.html', 'Headline': 'Witnesses who have testified before the grand jury - CNN', 'Snippet': 'For months, federal prosecutors have brought witnesses in front of a grand jury in Washington, DC, to investigate efforts by former President Donald Trump and his close allies to reverse the ...', 'Full_text': 'For months, federal prosecutors have brought witnesses in front of a grand jury in Washington, DC, to investigate efforts by former President Donald Trump and his close allies to reverse the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe witnesses, several of whom appeared under subpoena, range from low-level aides to Trump’s own vice president. There are also several key witnesses who have met with prosecutors for interviews that could help special counsel Jack Smith build his case.\n\nAny indictment that comes from the sprawling probe into aftermath of the election, efforts to overturn the result or the January 6, 2021, attack at the US Capitol will likely rely, at least in part, on what those individuals testified to under oath behind closed doors.\n\nHere’s who’s appeared before the grand jury or spoken with prosecutors:\n\nWitnesses who have testified before the grand jury\n\nMike Pence\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence testified in April – the first time in modern history that a vice president has been compelled to testify about the president he served beside.\n\nPence testified for over five hours and was likely asked to recount his direct conversations with Trump leading up to January 6, 2021, and Trump’s unsuccessfully attempt to pressure him into blocking the 2020 election’s result.\n\nBoth Pence and Trump asked for the subpoena to be thrown out, but trial and appellate judges rejected that request.\n\nMark Meadows\n\nMark Meadows, Trump’s former chief of staff, appeared before the grand jury in June.\n\nHe was also ordered by a judge to provide documents to investigators despite claims of executive privilege.\n\nAs chief of staff, Meadows was in the middle of Trump’s efforts to overturn the election in the two months between Election Day and Joe Biden’s inauguration. Meadows pushed Justice Department officials to investigate debunked claims of voter fraud and communicated with Trump’s allies about plans to challenge Biden’s win.\n\nMarc Short\n\nMarc Short, former chief of staff to Pence, testified to the grand jury about the fake elector scheme and the role of Trump lawyers John Eastman and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nGreg Jacob\n\nGreg Jacob, a former aide to Pence, was also questioned about the scheme to appoint fake electors in battleground states.\n\nShort and Jacob, both members of Pence’s inner circle, were present in key meetings in the lead-up to the January 6 riot that were part of a pressure campaign to convince Pence to disrupt Congress’ certification of Biden’s electoral win.\n\nDan Scavino\n\nFormer White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino testified to the grand jury twice – before and after a court decision that he cannot withhold answers on presidential secrecy grounds.\n\nPat Cipollone\n\nFormer Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone testified twice to the grand jury for several hours. Cipollone repeatedly opposed efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nPatrick Philbin\n\nPatrick Philbin, Cipollone’s deputy, also testified twice. He and Cipollone pushed back several occasions, including a proposal to replace the attorney general with someone willing to look into false claims of election fraud.\n\nStephen Miller\n\nStephen Miller, a former White House speechwriter and senior adviser to Trump, gave testimony in November that could provide a first-hand account of the former president’s preparations for his infamous speech at the Ellipse in Washington on January 6.\n\nMiller was the first known witness to testify under the purview of special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nKen Cuccinelli\n\nFormer Department of Homeland Security official Ken Cuccinelli testified in January. As a top figure at DHS, Cuccinelli fielded an inquiry from Trump and his top advisers about the executive branch seizing voting machines.\n\nTrump also considered appointing Cuccinelli to a special position after the election to root out election fraud on behalf of the White House, according to a Senate Judiciary Committee report.\n\nJohn Ratcliffe\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, who CNN has reported personally told Trump and his allies that there was no evidence of foreign election interference or widespread fraud, testified in April.\n\nNewt Gingrich\n\nFormer Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich allegedly communicated with senior advisers to Trump about television advertisements that relied on false claims of election fraud, according to the according to the House select committee, and joined efforts to submit fake slates of electors in battleground states that Trump lost.\n\nHe appeared in front of a grand jury in June.\n\nNick Luna\n\nFormer White House aide Nick Luna served as Trump’s bodyman, putting him by the president’s side during critical meetings leading up to the election as well as with him throughout the day on January 6, 2021.\n\nJohn McEntee\n\nAs director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office and an aide to the former president, John McEntee was in several small and potentially critical meetings around the election and may be able to shed light on Trump’s thinking at the time.\n\nBeau Harrison\n\nBeau Harrison was also an aide to Trump.\n\nWilliam Russell\n\nWilliam Russell, a former White House special assistant and deputy director of presidential advance, testified twice to the grand jury.\n\nMichael McDonald\n\nMichael McDonald is the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party and was allegedly one of the fake electors appointed in that state. McDonald was given limited immunity to testify.\n\nJim DeGraffenreid\n\nJim DeGraffenreid, another Nevada GOP official and Trump elector, was also given limited immunity to testify.\n\nG. Michael Brown\n\nAs a Trump campaign election day operations official, Gary Michael Brown allegedly told campaign staff he delivered fake elector votes for Trump from battleground states to Congress.\n\nAli Alexander\n\nAli Alexander was the leader of the “Stop the Steal” group who helped to organize rallies before the US Capitol attack. He testified before a grand jury last summer.\n\nSecret Service agents\n\nSeveral US Secret Service agents on Trump’s detail have also testified.\n\nPeople who were interviewed by prosecutors or investigators\n\nSome witnesses did not appear before a grand jury and were instead interviewed by FBI agents, investigators, or prosecutors with the special counsel’s office.\n\nDespite taking place in private, these interviews can be just a vital to a criminal investigation. Investigators generate an official report from each interview and can read information from these interviews to a grand jury to become part of the case’s record.\n\nHere is a list of the people who have sat for an interview:\n\nRusty Bowers\n\nRusty Bowers was a top Republican official in Arizona who rejected pressure from Trump and his allies in the aftermath of the 2020 election.\n\nBowers told CNN that he spoke with investigators about a call he had with both Trump and Giuliani after the election, and a second call with Trump alone.\n\nBowers added that probe appeared very broad, and that investigators knew “a lot of information about attorneys that work with them. About Mr. Giuliani that made the calls and visited us. And other members of his team, who they were, when the meetings were, what was discussed in those meetings or in that meeting.”\n\nBrad Raffensperger\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Raffensperger was interviewed by the special counsel’s office in late June, CNN has reported.\n\nAs part of the discussion, investigators likely questioned Raffensperger about a January 2021 phone call where Trump to pressed Raffensperger to “find” the votes needed for Trump to win the state of Georgia.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson\n\nCassidy Hutchinson was a trusted aide to Meadows, and her surprise bombshell testimony to the House select committee gave the American public insight into what she witnessed in the West Wing during the final weeks of the Trump administration.\n\nIn public testimony before the January 6 committee this summer, she recounted how Trump and his inner circle were warned about the potential for violence on January 6 and alleged that the former president wanted to join the throngs of his supporters at the Capitol.\n\nAlyssa Farah Griffin\n\nAlyssa Farah Griffin, a former White House communications director during the Trump administration who is now a CNN political commentator, voluntarily met with investigators in June.\n\nThe interview was focused primarily on Trump’s state of mind, what he knew about the baseless claims of widespread election fraud he was pushing leading up to the January 6 attack, efforts to pressure then-vice president Pence to overturn the election results, and the role of former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.\n\nChad Wolf\n\nChad Wolf, the one-time acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, met with FBI officials and Justice Department prosecutors after receiving a grand jury subpoena.\n\nWolf told prosecutors that after the 2020 election he was asked by White House officials if DHS had legal authority to seize voting machines and each time he said no, according to his attorney.\n\nRobert O’Brien\n\nNational security adviser Robert O’Brien also recounted to investigators earlier this year conversations about seizing voting machines, including during a heated Oval Office meeting that Trump participated in.\n\nRudy Giuliani\n\nRudy Giuliani, Trump’s former attorney, played a key role in the plot to appoint fake electors in battleground states as part of an effort to usurp Biden’s electoral college victory.\n\nThe special counsel’s office has also shown interest in several members of Trump’s post-election legal team, including Giuliani, who tried to help Trump’s push to use the department to overturn the election.\n\nMike Roman\n\nCNN reported that Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign official, has struck a deal with investigators to sit for an interview. Roman was involved in efforts to put forward slates of fake Trump electors following the 2020 election.\n\nBoris Epshteyn\n\nEpshteyn works as an attorney and adviser to Trump. Epshteyn was a special assistant to Trump at the White House and advised Trump during the 2020 campaign.\n\nFake electors in battleground states'}}",95.0,3

Raphael Warnock. The rally took place in the parking lot at Turner Field, AJC reported.\n\nDespite the rally being a socially distanced, drive-in rally, some photos revealed that while attendees wore masks, not all were actually social distancing. Deadline referred to the crowd as “somewhat socially distanced” and noted that about 500 cars were parked in attendance at the rally.\n\nBiden advocated for the Democrat candidates in the runoff, in part because of the stimulus checks. He told the group: “If you send Jon and the reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door, restoring hope and decency and honor for so many people,” he said.\n\nHe also noted: “And if you send (Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler) back to Washington, those checks will never get there…”\n\nDuring his speech, Biden told attendees: “The power is literally in your hands, unlike any time in my career. One state, one state can chart the course not just for the next four years but for a generation.”\n\nHe also stated: “The debate over $2,000 isn’t some abstract debate in Washington, it’s about real lives.

Spurred on by then-President Trump, rioters had traveled from far and wide to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHundreds involved in the siege have been arrested, but many remain at large as officials piece together what happened on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHere are some notable facts about the insurrection and its fallout:\n\nMinutes Trump spoke before the siege: About 70\n\nThe day began with a rally to bolster Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential race was stolen from him. Before Congress certified election results, thousands of Trump supporters gathered on the National Mall, just south of the White House, and listened for hours as some of Trump’s most prominent defenders, including his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, promoted the falsehood.\n\nTrump addressed the crowd for one hour and 11 minutes and said he would “never concede” the race, and that if his supporters didn’t “fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nRally attendance: Thousands\n\nRally organizers told the National Park Service that they anticipated 30,000 people would attend. Law enforcement said the crowd size ahead of the protest was possibly as much as 80,000, according to then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. The crowd size at the rally was at least 10,000, according to the Associated Press.\n\nPeople surrounding the Capitol before the breach: Several thousand\n\nA lot of attendees are believed to have peeled off as the siege turned violent. Experts say it\'s challenging to accurately estimate the crowd size because of the absence of aerial imagery, but they put a broad crowd size estimate at ""several thousand.""\n\nCapitol Police officers on duty: More than 1,200\n\nMore than 1,200 Capitol Police officers were working on U.S. Capitol grounds at the time of the attack. The Capitol Police has not said exactly how many officers were guarding the Capitol building itself.\n\nThe time it took for reinforcements to arrive: 15 minutes (but it\'s complicated)\n\nThe Capitol complex was breached on Jan. 6 about 1:50 p.m. Though some District of Columbia police officers responded within 15 minutes, the Pentagon took more than three hours to send National Guard troops to aide Capitol Police, according to Maj. Gen. William J. Walker. But a watchdog report is critical of this timeline.\n\nDeaths from the insurrection: 5 (or more)\n\nMost news sources have officially counted five deaths including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died after suffering two strokes, and San Diego resident Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by Capitol Police while climbing a barricaded door inside the Capitol. But some in Congress — including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) — have suggested the number of deaths is closer to nine and should include officers who committed suicide in the days and months following the attack.\n\nOfficers injured: More than 140\n\nMore than 140 law enforcement officers were physically harmed during the insurrection, according to a special congressional committee investigating the attack.

More than 30 of those arrests were in California. The FBI is still seeking the public’s help to identify rioters.\n\nHours the certification of electors was delayed: More than 13\n\nThe Capitol was breached about 1:50 p.m. The Senate called a recess about 2:11 p.m. The Capitol was declared secure at 8 p.m.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) brought the House back into session at 9 p.m., and Vice President Mike Pence officially declared Joe Biden president-elect at 3:42 a.m. the next day.\n\nCost of cleanup and repairs: $1.5 million to more than $30 million\n\nTotal damages have been estimated to cost anywhere from $1.5 million to more than $30 million and include repairs and security measures like fencing.\n\nRioters left behind feces, blood, bullet holes, graffiti and bear repellent. Curators have requested $25,000 to restore historic artwork, including the bust of a U.S. politician accused of inciting another violent attack in the Capitol in 1954 — an armed group of four demanding Puerto Rico’s independence.\n\nPeople subpoenaed by Congress: 50-plus\n\nCongress has issued 51 subpoenas and counting in its investigation into the siege. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Trump advisor Stephen K. Bannon are among those subpoenaed. Members of far-right extremist groups like the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have also been drawn into the investigation for their roles in planning and orchestrating the riot.\n\nJan. 6-related lawsuits involving Trump: At least 5\n\nThe insurrection has spawned more than five lawsuits, all involving Trump. A group of House Democrats, some Capitol Police officers and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Dublin) filed separate lawsuits against Trump for his role in inciting the mob to overtake the Capitol.\n\nTrump has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review his lawsuit to block the release of White House records relating to the attack.

It’s part of a series of “Save America” rallies that he’s hosting. Here’s a look at how many people attended Trump’s rally, including crowd photos and updates about what happened. Opinions on how large the crowd was varied from person to person attending.\n\nThousands Attended Trump’s Georgia Rally, With Some Saying Attendance Was Smaller than Normal & Others Saying Attendance Was ‘Massive’\n\nThe rally took place at the Banks County Dragway (formerly known as the NHRA International Dragway) in Commerce, Georgia. Although doors opened in the afternoon, Trump’s speech was scheduled to begin around 7 p.m. Eastern, but he began about an hour late, Athens Banner-Herald reported.\n\nThe event was in part to support local Republican candidates or politicians, Athens Banner-Herald reported. Those on the speakers list included Herschel Walker and Sen. David Perdue who is running for governor. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was also among the people scheduled to speak.\n\nOpinions about crowd size varied. Some in attendance said the crowd was “massive.” However, other reporters said the crowd was much smaller than Trump used to attract. Here’s a look at the various reports. It’s not known if local police will share an official estimate, but we will add it to this story if they do.\n\nStephen Fowler of GPB News (an NPR affiliate) attended the rally and estimated on Twitter that there were about 5,000 people in attendance. He wrote that it was “the smallest Trump rally I’ve ever covered here.” He said it was much smaller than the 20,000 to 30,000-size rallies that Trump had hosted in 2020.\n\nGreg Bluestein of Atlanta-Journal Constitution shared a photo during the rally indicating that the crowd behind the TV risers didn’t extend “as far as the eye could see,” as Trump had said it did.\n\nFowler also shared a photo of the crowd, which was large but didn’t extend quite as far back as past rally crowds have done.\n\nHowever, Joshua L. Jones of the Athens Banner-Herald tweeted that around 5:30 p.m. Eastern, there was a “massive crowd” at the rally, and shared a photo of a packed crowd.\n\nBurt Jones, a conservative running for Lieutenant Governor, described the crowd as “huge.”\n\nTrump quickly began his speech by calling the current Governor Brian Kemp a “RINO,” as he supported one of Kemp’s opponents. He commented that he was angry that he had supported Kemp in the past.\n\nFowler later shared a photo showing the crowd differences between 8:50, 8:20, and 7:20. He said the cold and windy weather was leading some to leave early, while Trump was still speaking.\n\nTrump also commented to attendees that he believed Georgia was “red as hell” and voting for Perdue would be “a vote for this country.”\n\nAt one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz said he would nominate Trump to be the Speaker of the House.\n\nThis happened while Trump was bringing some of the candidates he endorsed, along with others, to speak on the stage with him.\n\nTrump Has Two More Rallies Scheduled\n\nTrump has two more rallies scheduled over the next two weeks, according to his website. A rally in Washington, Michigan, is taking place on April 2 at 7 p.m. Eastern at the Michigan Star Sports Center. And a rally in Selma, North Carolina, is taking place on April 9 at 7 p.m. Eastern at The Farm at 95.\n\nTrump’s first rally of 2022 was in Florence, Arizona in mid-January. Trump held a September rally in Georgia. He also held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, in October 2021, a rally in Alabama in August 2021, and an Ohio rally in June 2021. He also held a rally in Conroe, Texas, in January that was attended by tens of thousands, according to media at the event.\n\nIn his August Alabama rally, he was booed after telling the people present to take the vaccines. He replied: “You know what? I believe totally in your freedoms, I do. You have to do what you have to do. But, I recommend take the vaccines, I did it, it’s good. Take the vaccines.”\n\nTrump has not yet announced if he is running in the 2024 presidential election. However, he did tell the crowd during his speech in South Carolina that “we may have to run again,” and added “we will take back the White House.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/aug/08/viral-image/photo-claiming-massive-crowd-trumps-aug-5-wisconsi/', 'Headline': 'Photo claiming ‘massive’ crowd at Trump’s Aug. 5 Wisconsin rally is ...', 'Snippet': 'Social media posts shared a photo from Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign and claimed it was of an Aug. 5, 2022, rally in Wisconsin.

Now that Biden is president, Trump-rally ...', 'Full_text': 'You never know exactly what you’re going to get at a Trump rally—a creative variation on the “Lock her up” chant? A brand-new conspiracy theory? But you can always rely on the former president to brag about the size of the crowd. He will remark happily upon the gridlocked traffic getting into the event. He will exclaim that he cannot even pinpoint exactly where the crowd ends. And periodically, he will demand that videographers pivot their cameras around to capture the full extent of his devoted following.\n\nFor Donald Trump and his supporters, crowd size is more than just a bragging point. It’s proof that they are part of the American majority. “A person that comes here and has crowds that go further than the eye can see … and has cars that stretch out for 25 miles, that’s not somebody that lost an election,” Trump told the crowd at his rally in Florence, Arizona, on Saturday.\n\nBefore the 2020 election, Trump and his fans would often ask reporters how Joe Biden could possibly win when he didn’t have rallies as big as Trump’s. Now that Biden is president, Trump-rally goers say things like Trump couldn’t really have lost. Look at all of these people! In Arizona this weekend, 51-year-old Tammy Shutts put it this way to me: “100 percent, 1,000 percent, 1 million percent Biden didn’t win” her state, she said, gesturing to the hordes of people around her. “I’ve been in Arizona for almost 21 years. There is no way—no way—we went blue.”\n\nMany American liberals live in political bubbles. Some people in overwhelmingly blue parts of the country, for example, were shocked to find that Trump got so many votes in 2016. (“I live in a rather special world. I only know one person who voted for [Richard] Nixon,” the film critic Pauline Kael famously said of the former president, acknowledging her own political bubble just weeks after Nixon smashed George McGovern in 1972.) Some of those same blue-area Democrats were just as confident that Senator Elizabeth Warren would be the party nominee. But Republicans also live in bubbles.\n\nHuman beings aren’t particularly comfortable hearing information that challenges our closely held beliefs, and the urge to reject evidence that goes against our political opinions is especially strong. Reading only certain websites or watching particular TV channels shields Americans from facts and opinions they don’t like, and geographic sorting protects partisans from unpleasant interactions with people who hold different beliefs. Political segregation in America has increased dramatically in the past decade. “For about one in five Republicans, and two in five Democrats, less than a quarter of their neighbors belong to the opposite political party,” according to a recent study published in Nature. In other words, Trump voters might find it hard to believe that Biden won the election because their neighbors and friends mostly voted for Trump too.\n\nTrump’s rallies amplify these phenomena, Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard who co-wrote the Nature study, told me. “You have the president saying things, your neighbors who you [perceive as] saying the same things, and then these Trump rallies seem to be almost a social event,” he said. “Now you have an element of your social life, not just what you’re seeing on TV, that is caught up in believing these lies.” When you’re literally surrounded by believers, it’s hard to remember that doubters exist. Inside Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, for example, it can seem like the whole world is made up of Hawkeyes fans. Fortunately, that’s not true.

And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/read-full-jan-6-committee-report-detailing-investigation-capitol-attac-rcna63065', 'Headline': 'Read the full Jan. 6 committee report detailing its investigation into ...', 'Snippet': ""The House Jan. 6 committee released its full report on the Capitol attack Thursday, capping 18 months of investigative work.

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January.

It comes after an 18-month investigation into the events which culminated in the insurrection at the Capitol in 2021. In more than 800 pages, the report details what led the panel to vote to issue four criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump, among other recommendations. And it lays out a path forward for the panel\'s findings. Here\'s Chairman Bennie Thompson.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBENNIE THOMPSON: We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a roadmap to justice and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we\'ve provided to aid in their work.\n\nFADEL: To walk us through all of this is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hi, Claudia.\n\nCLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.\n\nFADEL: Good morning. So what are some of the report\'s major findings?\n\nGRISALES: It focuses largely on former President Trump\'s premeditated role in the January 6 attack and goes further into his criminal referrals from the committee. The report is eight chapters long covering false claims of a stolen election, the fake elector scheme, and, quote, ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" referencing Trump\'s inaction during the siege. One chapter is titled after a federal judge\'s description of Trump\'s post-2020 election efforts, calling it a, quote, ""coup in search of a legal theory"" and captures desperate attempts to overturn the presidential result, such as trying to force then-Vice President Mike Pence to illegally reverse President Biden\'s win in a ceremonial counting of the vote. Finally, it details ties between extremist groups and Trump allies.\n\nFADEL: So how does the report delve into law enforcement and intelligence failures?\n\nGRISALES: It reiterates other findings that there were significant failures here. For example, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley, said before January 6, the probability for violence was clear. And he expected, quote, ""street fights when the sun went down.""\n\nFADEL: What role does the American public play when it comes to these findings?\n\nGRISALES: The panel says while the danger to the Capitol by an armed and angry crowd was foreseeable, the fact that a president would be the catalyst was unprecedented. The report says, quote, ""If we lack the imagination that a president would incite an attack on his own government,"" it goes on to say, ""we lack that insight no more."" And it says the best defense against that danger in the future will not come from law enforcement but rather an informed and active citizenry.\n\nFADEL: OK. So what recommendations does the report lay out?\n\nGRISALES: The first is reforms to the Electoral Count Act. This would solidify a vice president\'s role as ceremonial. And this is part of a major spending bill that could head to President Biden\'s desk today. It also says it\'s now up to the Justice Department and courts to take the lead on criminal referrals and that respective legal bar associations should evaluate the conduct of attorneys named in the report, who should not, quote, ""undermine the constitutional and statutory process for peacefully transferring power in our government."" This includes attorney John Eastman, who was tied to the plot to overturn the result, Kenneth Chesebro, a central figure in the fake elector scheme, and other Trump-aligned attorneys such as Rudy Giuliani.\n\nFADEL: OK. So, Claudia, now that this investigation is done, the report is out. What are the next steps?\n\nGRISALES: There are still more records to come and plenty. For example, a few dozen witness transcripts have been shared so far by the panel, but hundreds more are expected in the coming days as the panel will sunset December 31.\n\nFADEL: NPR\'s Claudia Grisales, thank you so much.\n\nGRISALES: Thank you much.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

Trump signed an official attestation attached to the suit swearing that the data in it was accurate despite the fact that one ...', 'Full_text': 'The criminal referrals were a major escalation for a congressional investigation that is the most significant in a generation. The panel named five other Trump allies — Mark Meadows, his final chief of staff, and the lawyers Rudolph W. Giuliani, John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro — as potential co-conspirators with Mr. Trump in actions the committee said warranted Justice Department investigation. The charges, including a fourth for Mr. Trump of conspiracy to make a false statement, would carry prison sentences, some of them lengthy, if federal prosecutors chose to pursue them.\n\nThe committee’s referrals do not carry legal weight or compel any action by the Justice Department, which is conducting its own investigation into Jan. 6 and the actions of Mr. Trump and his allies leading up to the attack. But the referrals sent a powerful signal that a bipartisan committee of Congress believes the former president committed crimes.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the referrals.\n\nMr. Trump attacked the committee as “highly partisan” ahead of a final meeting the panel held on Monday to release an executive summary of its final report on the Capitol attack and to vote on referring the former president to the Justice Department.\n\n“It’s a kangaroo court,” Mr. Trump said Monday on “The Dan Bongino Show.” “The people aren’t going to stand for it.” He elaborated on that theme in a post on Truth Social, his social media network, after the meeting.\n\n“These folks don’t get it that when they come after me, people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me,” he said, adding that he “told everyone to go home” on Jan. 6, but leaving out his hours of inaction before that while a mob of his supporters rampaged through the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans, who have vowed to investigate the committee after they take control of the House in January, mounted a modest response. Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 House Republican, was one of the few to react with a statement, accusing the committee of staging a “partisan charade.” She promised that Republicans “will hold House Democrats accountable for their illegitimate abuse of power.”\n\nThe executive summary, a 154-page narrative of Mr. Trump’s relentless drive to remain in power after he lost the 2020 election by seven million votes, identifies co-conspirators who aided Mr. Trump. But it singles out the former president as the primary cause of the mob violence.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straightforward conclusion: The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the summary stated. “None of the events of Jan. 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nThe summary closely follows the evidence from the committee’s 10 previous public hearings, but the facts have been assembled into a readable narrative that amounts to an astonishing story of Mr. Trump’s efforts to effectively overthrow the government he led. The committee is expected to release a lengthy final report on Wednesday.\n\n“Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one,” Representative Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican and vice chairwoman of the committee, said at the start of the meeting.\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee, said of Mr. Trump: “Nothing could be a greater betrayal of this duty than to assist in insurrection against the constitutional order.”\n\nThe summary and referrals have now set up a dynamic without parallel in the annals of American campaigns: Congress asking the Justice Department of an incumbent president to consider criminal charges against the president’s potential opponent in the next election. President Biden has indicated his intent to run in 2024, and Mr. Trump announced his re-election campaign last month.\n\nThe summary laid out step by step how Mr. Trump sought to cling to power, much as the committee did during its televised hearings in the summer. First, the summary said, Mr. Trump lied about widespread fraud, despite being told his claims were false. He then organized false slates of electors in states won by Mr. Biden as he pressured state officials, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election. Finally, he amassed a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol, where they engaged in hours of bloody violence while Mr. Trump did nothing to call them off.\n\n“Even key individuals who worked closely with President Trump to try to overturn the 2020 election on Jan. 6 ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful,” the committee wrote.\n\nThe panel also referred four Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee — including the man seeking to become the next speaker, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California — because of their refusal to comply with the panel’s subpoenas.\n\nMr. McCarthy’s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe other Republicans referred were Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Jordan, Russell Dye, said in a statement that the referral was “just another partisan and political stunt.” A spokesman for Mr. Perry, Jay Ostrich, said the committee was engaged in “more games from a petulant and soon-to-be kangaroo court.’’\n\nMr. Biggs said in a tweet that the referral was the committee’s “final political stunt” and that he looked forward to “reviewing their documents, publishing their lies and setting the record straight” in the next Congress.\n\nIn its summary, the committee did not entirely resolve disputed accounts of what happened inside the presidential S.U.V. when Mr. Trump was told by his Secret Service agents that they could not take him to the Capitol to join the crowd on Jan. 6. Cassidy Hutchinson, a former White House aide, testified under oath to the committee in public last summer that Anthony M. Ornato, a White House deputy chief of staff, told her that Mr. Trump grew so angry that he lunged at his Secret Service agent and tried to grab the steering wheel. The Secret Service denied that account anonymously.\n\nThe summary said only that the “committee has now obtained evidence from several sources about a ‘furious interaction’” that occurred in the S.U.V. “The vast majority of witnesses who have testified to the select committee about this topic, including multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Metropolitan Police and national security officials in the White House, described President Trump’s behavior as ‘irate,’ ‘furious,’ ‘insistent,’ ‘profane’ and ‘heated.’”\n\nThe committee’s summary also concluded that there was no nefarious reason for why the National Guard was delayed for hours in responding to violence of Jan. 6.\n\n“Although evidence identifies a likely miscommunication between members of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense impacting the timing of deployment, the committee has found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard,” the committee wrote. “The select committee recognizes that some at the department had genuine concerns, counseling caution, that President Trump might give an illegal order to use the military in support of his efforts to overturn the election.”\n\nIn its summary, the panel asked the Justice Department to investigate whether anyone had interfered with or obstructed the panel’s investigation, including whether any lawyers paid for by groups connected to Mr. Trump “may have advised clients to provide false or misleading testimony to the committee.”\n\nAmong the committee’s findings, revealed at its meeting on Monday, was that lawmakers became concerned that lawyers who were paid by Trump associates may have tried to interfere with the panel’s investigation. The panel also learned that a client was offered potential employment that would make her “financially very comfortable” as the date of her testimony approached. But then offers were withdrawn or did not materialize as reports of the content of her testimony circulated, the committee said.\n\nThe committee also chastised certain witnesses that it said had not been forthright with investigators. It said it had “significant concerns about the credibility” of the testimony of Mr. Ornato.\n\nThe committee also said Kayleigh McEnany, one of Mr. Trump’s former press secretaries, and Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, had been less than forthcoming.\n\nThe summary demonstrated, as the committee’s hearings did, how despite being told repeatedly that his claims of election fraud were false, Mr. Trump kept up the lies.\n\nBill Stepien, a former White House political director, told the committee how he and others would investigate the claims, find them to be false, and report back to the president. “It’s an easier job to be telling the president about, you know, wild allegations,” Mr. Stepien said. “It’s a harder job to be telling him on the back end that, yeah, that wasn’t true.”\n\nThe summary also contained evidence that certain White House aides had grown concerned about the potential for violence on Jan. 6 and urged Mr. Trump to make a pre-emptive statement calling for peace. No such statement was made.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House communications director, said she suggested “several times” on Jan. 4 and 5 that Mr. Trump “publicly state that Jan. 6 must remain peaceful, and that he had refused her advice to do so,” the panel wrote.\n\nThe panel played new video from Ms. Hicks, who described a conversation with Mr. Trump.\n\n“I was becoming increasingly concerned that we were damaging his legacy,” Ms. Hicks said she told the president.\n\nMr. Trump’s response? “Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,” she recalled him saying.\n\nWhile the executive summary of the report focused heavily on Mr. Trump, it did conclude some findings about law enforcement failures, a topic not previously addressed at the panel’s hearings. “No analysis recognized the full scale and extent of the threat to the Capitol on Jan. 6,” the committee wrote, although the “intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did successfully detect the planning for potential violence on Jan. 6, including planning specifically by the Proud Boys and Oath Keeper militia groups who ultimately led the attack on the Capitol.”\n\nOver the past year and a half, the committee interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, obtained more than one million documents, issued more than 100 subpoenas and held hearings that drew millions of viewers.\n\nThe House created the Jan. 6 committee after Senate Republicans used a filibuster to defeat a proposal to create an independent commission to investigate the attack.\n\nThe committee — made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans — consistently broke new ground for a congressional investigation. Staffed with more than a dozen former federal prosecutors, the panel set a new production standard for how to hold a congressional hearing. It also got significantly ahead of a parallel Justice Department investigation into the events of Jan. 6, with federal prosecutors later interviewing many of the same witnesses Congress had spoken to.\n\nIn recent weeks, federal prosecutors under the supervision of a special counsel have issued subpoenas to officials in seven states in which the Trump campaign organized electors to falsely certify the election for Mr. Trump despite the voters choosing Mr. Biden.\n\nLawmakers on the panel also believe they played a significant role in elevating the issue of threats to democracy to voters, who rejected many election deniers in the November midterms.\n\nIn terms of legislative recommendations, the panel has already endorsed overhauling the Electoral Count Act, the law that Mr. Trump and his allies tried to exploit on Jan. 6 in an attempt to cling to power. Lawmakers have also discussed changes to the Insurrection Act and legislation to enforce the 14th Amendment’s prohibition on insurrectionists holding office. Those recommendations are expected to be detailed in the committee’s final report.\n\nKatie Benner and Anushka Patil contributed reporting.\n\nAnnotation: This reflects the committee’s finding that Mr. Trump’s repeated false claims that the election was rigged had both a political and financial motive. During its second hearing, the panel introduced evidence that Trump supporters donated nearly $100 million to Mr. Trump’s so-called Election Defense Fund but that the money flowed instead into a super PAC the president had created. It was not just “the big lie,” the committee said. It was also “the big rip-off.”\n\n2. Knowing that he and his supporters had lost dozens of election lawsuits, and despite his own senior advisers refuting his election fraud claims and urging him to concede his election loss, Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome.\n\nAnnotation: Mr. Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results of the election and lost all but one of them. Many of the suits, the committee determined, were brought even after some of Mr. Trump’s closest aides — including his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and his attorney general, William P. Barr — told him that there was no fraud that could have changed the outcome of the race.\n\n3. Despite knowing that such an action would be illegal, and that no state had or would submit an altered electoral slate, Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress’s joint session on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: The committee discovered that the lawyer John Eastman had advised Mr. Trump to undertake a campaign to push Mr. Pence into single-handedly deciding the election in his favor even though there was evidence that Mr. Eastman knew the plan was illegal. Some of Mr. Pence’s own aides told Mr. Trump the same, but he pressured Mr. Pence nonetheless.\n\n4. Donald Trump sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice by attempting to enlist department officials to make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the presidential election. After that effort failed, Donald Trump offered the position of acting attorney general to Jeff Clark knowing that Clark intended to disseminate false information aimed at overturning the election.\n\nAnnotation: After leaders in the Justice Department — including Jeffrey Rosen, the acting attorney general, and Richard Donoghue, his deputy — told Mr. Trump that he was wrong about his claims concerning fraud in the election, Mr. Trump wanted to appoint Mr. Clark, a loyalist, to run the department. Mr. Clark had promised to send out letters to leaders in key swing states saying that prosecutors had in fact found fraud in the election. The president decided not to appoint Mr. Clark only after several senior department officials threatened to quit if he did.\n\n5. Without any evidentiary basis and contrary to state and federal law, Donald Trump unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states.\n\nAnnotation: In the weeks that followed the election, Mr. Trump and his allies had calls and meetings with local officials in key swing states like Michigan and Arizona in which they pressured the officials to use their powers to assign electors from the states to him. More famously, Mr. Trump also asked Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, to help him “find” the 11,000 votes he needed to win the election there.\n\n6. Donald Trump oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nAnnotation: This refers to one of Mr. Trump’s most expansive schemes to maintain his grip on power: a plan to have state officials create and submit fake electors pledged to him in seven swing states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n7. Donald Trump pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states.\n\nAnnotation: The committee found that Mr. Trump also played a role in a plan closely related to the fake-electors scheme: He helped to persuade 139 House Republicans to dispute the Electoral College count on the day the Capitol was attacked.\n\n8. Donald Trump purposely verified false information filed in federal court.\n\nAnnotation: In December 2020, Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit in Fulton County, Ga., contending that thousands of votes had been improperly counted and citing specific numbers of dead people, felons and unregistered voters who had cast ballots. Mr. Trump signed an official attestation attached to the suit swearing that the data in it was accurate despite the fact that one of his own lawyers, Mr. Eastman, had determined it was false.\n\n9. Based on false allegations that the election was stolen, Donald Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for Jan. 6. Although these supporters were angry and some were armed, Donald Trump instructed them to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to “take back” their country.\n\nAnnotation: The committee determined that a tweet posted by Mr. Trump on Dec. 19, 2020, announcing a “wild” protest in Washington on Jan. 6 was heard as a clarion call by both far-right extremists and ordinary Trump supporters who sprang into action preparing for the event. When they got to Washington for the rally, Mr. Trump’s speech calling on them to “fight like hell” was a central driver in sending them on toward the Capitol.\n\n10. Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: The tweet the committee is referring to here said, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.” Court papers show that some rioters at the Capitol responded directly to it by pushing toward and ultimately into the building.\n\n11. Knowing that violence was underway at the Capitol, and despite his duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, Donald Trump refused repeated requests over a multiple-hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television. This failure to act perpetuated the violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress’s proceeding to count electoral votes.\n\nAnnotation: The committee accused Mr. Trump of “a dereliction of duty” for letting nearly three hours pass between learning that the Capitol was under siege and calling for his supporters to leave the Capitol grounds. During that time, several people close to him — including his daughter Ivanka — begged Mr. Trump to issue a statement that would calm down the crowd.\n\n12. Each of these actions by Donald Trump was taken in support of a multipart conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n13. The intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did successfully detect the planning for potential violence on Jan. 6, including planning specifically by the Proud Boys and Oath Keeper militia groups who ultimately led the attack on the Capitol. As Jan. 6 approached, the intelligence specifically identified the potential for violence at the Capitol. This intelligence was shared within the executive branch, including with the Secret Service and the president’s National Security Council.\n\n14. Intelligence gathered in advance of Jan. 6 did not support a conclusion that antifa or other left-wing groups would likely engage in a violent counterdemonstration, or attack Trump supporters on Jan. 6. Indeed, intelligence from Jan. 5 indicated that some left-wing groups were instructing their members to “stay at home” and not attend on Jan. 6. Ultimately, none of these groups was involved to any material extent with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n15. Neither the intelligence community nor law enforcement obtained intelligence in advance of Jan. 6 on the full extent of the ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results. Such agencies apparently did not (and potentially could not) anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer the crowd in his Ellipse speech, that President Trump would “spontaneously” instruct the crowd to march to the Capitol, that President Trump would exacerbate the violent riot by sending his 2:24 p.m. tweet condemning Vice President Pence, or the full scale of the violence and lawlessness that would ensue. Nor did law enforcement anticipate that President Trump would refuse to direct his supporters to leave the Capitol once violence began. No intelligence community advance analysis predicted exactly how President Trump would behave; no such analysis recognized the full scale and extent of the threat to the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation for 13, 14 and 15: The committee has faced criticism, especially from Republicans, for not focusing more attention on the failures by intelligence and law enforcement officials on Jan. 6 and in the weeks leading up to the Capitol attack. But the panel did present some preliminary findings and may ultimately issue a separate report.\n\n16. Hundreds of Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan Police officers performed their duties bravely on Jan. 6, and America owes those individual immense gratitude for their courage in the defense of Congress and our constitution. Without their bravery, Jan. 6 would have been far worse. Although certain members of the Capitol Police leadership regarded their approach to Jan. 6 as “all hands on deck” the Capitol Police leadership did not have sufficient assets in place to address the violent and lawless crowd. Capitol Police leadership did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensue after President Trump instructed tens of thousands of his supporters in the Ellipse crowd to march to the Capitol, and then tweeted at 2:24 p.m. Although Chief Steven Sund raised the idea of National Guard support, the Capitol Police Board did not request Guard assistance prior to Jan. 6. The Metropolitan Police took an even more proactive approach to Jan. 6, and deployed roughly 800 officers, including responding to the emergency calls for help at the Capitol. Rioters still managed to break their line in certain locations, when the crowd surged forward in the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump’s 2:24 p.m. tweet. The Department of Justice readied a group of federal agents at Quantico and in the District of Columbia, anticipating that Jan. 6 could become violent, and then deployed those agents once it became clear that police at the Capitol were overwhelmed. Agents from the Department of Homeland Security were also deployed to assist.\n\n17. President Trump had authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on Jan. 6 or on any other day. Nor did he instruct any federal law enforcement agency to assist. Because the authority to deploy the National Guard had been delegated to the Department of Defense, the secretary of defense could, and ultimately did, deploy the Guard. Although evidence identifies a likely miscommunication between members of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense impacting the timing of deployment, the committee has found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard. The select committee recognizes that some at the department had genuine concerns, counseling caution, that President Trump might give an illegal order to use the military in support of his efforts to overturn the election.\n\nAnnotation: The question of why it took so long to deploy the National Guard to the Capitol is one of the enduring mysteries of Jan. 6. While the committee sharply criticized Mr. Trump for failing to taking action that day, it also found that there was no evidence the deployment of the Guard was delayed for political reasons.\n\nThe panel voted 9 to 0 to accept the final report and to urge the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against Mr. Trump and his allies in four separate areas of the law.\n\nHere are some takeaways:\n\nThe committee kept its focus on Trump.\n\nThe committee’s hourlong presentation focused almost exclusively on Mr. Trump, essentially ignoring findings about intelligence and security failures at the Capitol before and during the attack. The committee also did not dwell on the information it collected about the rise of domestic extremism.\n\nThe focus on Mr. Trump had been telegraphed for months as the committee drafted its final report, using it primarily as a means to hold Mr. Trump to account for his actions in trying to prevent the orderly transfer of power after a presidential election. As Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a Republican and the panel’s vice chairwoman, put it: “Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one.”\n\nIn one place, the report laid out the facts of how Trump attempted to stay in power.\n\nThe summary of the committee’s final report is a remarkable account of a president’s desperate attempt to stay in office following his election loss to Mr. Biden in 2020.\n\nWhile it breaks no new ground since the panel’s series of public hearings this summer, the report for the first time brings together all the facts in one place.\n\nThe report states that even people around Mr. Trump “ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful.”\n\nThe report laid out, step by step, how Mr. Trump sought to cling to power after losing the 2020 election: first, by lying about widespread fraud, despite being told his claims were false; by organizing false slates of electors in states won by Mr. Biden; by pressuring state officials, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election; and finally, by amassing a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol, where they engaged in hours of bloody violence while Mr. Trump did nothing to call them off.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straightforward conclusion: The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the report states. “None of the events of Jan. 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nThe committee revealed new details from two top advisers: Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway.\n\nThe committee revealed on Monday the investigative work it had done since the end of their previous hearings. That included the panel’s first interviews with two of the former president’s top advisers: Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway.\n\nMs. Hicks, who served as a senior adviser in the White House, said that when she raised concerns with the former president about the actions on Jan. 6 affecting Mr. Trump’s legacy, he responded that “nobody will care about my legacy if I lose. So, that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning.”\n\nThe committee also revealed testimony from Ms. Conway, who described telling Mr. Trump that Jan. 6 was a “terrible day.” She recalled him responding: “No. People are upset. They are very upset.”\n\nThe events of Jan. 6 hurt Trump but did not knock him out of 2024 contention.\n\nThe work of the committee over the past year has already helped to chip away at Mr. Trump’s political standing and his reputation as the nation’s 45th president. Ms. Cheney said again on Monday that Mr. Trump should never “serve in any position of authority in our nation again. He is unfit for any office.”\n\nAnd yet, Mr. Trump already has announced his pursuit of the presidency again, hoping to reclaim the office he falsely asserts was stolen from him. Despite a rocky campaign announcement and a swirl of potential criminal prosecutions, Mr. Trump remains a central figure in the Republican Party, with strong support across the country. And he has weathered setbacks, both political and legal, before.\n\nThe committee’s legacy is still an open question.\n\nThe legacy of the Jan. 6 committee is now out of the panel’s hands, and will most likely be determined by federal prosecutors in the coming months. It will be up to Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed to oversee investigations into Mr. Trump’s actions, to determine whether the information sent over by the committee, along with the Justice Department’s own material, warrants charging the former president with any crimes.\n\nThat remains an open question. Members of the committee were firm on Monday in their belief that Mr. Trump and the people around him violated four statutes in the planning and execution of the Capitol attack. They are: obstructing or influencing an official proceeding; conspiring against the U.S. government; making false statements to the government; and engaging in insurrection against the government.\n\nPursuing those charges, or others, against Mr. Trump would be a historic effort to hold the nation’s top official accountable for his actions. But it will be up to the special counsel, and ultimately Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, to decide whether to move forward. Other Justice Department officials will have to decide whether to charge Mr. Trump’s aides as committee members called for.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are already gearing up to discredit the committee when they take control of the House in January. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, who is seeking to become the speaker next year, has vowed to investigate the committee’s work and has demanded that the staff and lawmakers preserve records for that purpose.\n\nThe committee has not been a political boon for many of its members.\n\nThe end of the Jan. 6 committee is also the end of the House careers of four of the nine members of the panel.\n\nTwo of them — Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, and Representative Stephanie Murphy, Democrat of Florida — decided not to run for re-election in 2022. Mr. Kinzinger faced fierce opposition from within his own party because of his frequent criticism of Mr. Trump and his decision to be part of the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nTwo others — Ms. Cheney and Representative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia — lost their House seats in 2022. Ms. Cheney was defeated in her primary campaign in Wyoming after drawing the ire of party officials and voters for her opposition to Mr. Trump and her determination to hold him accountable for Jan. 6. Ms. Luria was defeated in the general election in Virginia.\n\nAll four have said they have no regrets about serving on the committee. But it is unlikely to serve as a political steppingstone for many of its members.\n\nThe panel’s recommendations that charges should be brought were based on an exhaustive investigation that spanned months and included interviews with key witnesses that even federal prosecutors may not have spoken to yet.\n\nIn presenting the committee’s findings, Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said he did not want the “foot soldiers” who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to go to jail while “the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass.”\n\nMr. Raskin explained that charges were warranted against Mr. Trump and others — chief among them the lawyer John Eastman, an architect of several plans to overturn Mr. Trump’s defeat. Nine months ago, Mr. Raskin noted, a federal judge in California, ruling in a civil case, concluded that there was evidence that Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman had conspired together to commit federal crimes.\n\nAs for the Justice Department’s efforts, not much is publicly known about any specific charges that the special counsel, Jack Smith, might be considering in a criminal prosecution. The department is under no obligation to adopt the committee’s conclusions or to follow its recommendations.\n\nStill, there has been some overlap between criminal statutes cited by the department and the charges the committee recommended, according to search warrants and subpoenas that have gradually surfaced during the federal inquiry.\n\nOne charge that both the panel and prosecutors have placed at the center of their work is obstruction of an official proceeding before Congress. The Justice Department mentioned that count in a warrant used in June to seize the cellphone of Jeffrey Clark, a former department official whom the committee referred for criminal charges on Monday.\n\nProsecutors have already used the obstruction count in nearly 300 criminal cases to describe how the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 disrupted the certification of the election that was taking place there during a joint session of Congress.\n\nDespite its wide use, the statute was never an easy fit for the violence that erupted at the Capitol.\n\nIt was passed into law as part of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which sought to curb corporate malfeasance by clamping down on things like shredding documents and tampering with witnesses. And defense lawyers have challenged its use in a federal appeals court in Washington, arguing that prosecutors stretched it beyond its original scope and used it to criminalize behavior that closely resembles protest protected by the First Amendment.\n\nStill, the obstruction count could apply much better to Mr. Trump’s behavior than to that of hundreds of ordinary rioters.\n\nThe law requires proving that any interference with a congressional proceeding be done “corruptly.” The committee said in its recommendations that Mr. Trump had clearly acted with a “‘corrupt’ purpose” because he was warned in advance that several of his schemes to maintain his grip on power were illegal.\n\nThe committee also recommended that Mr. Trump and others be charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, a count that has been used in several Justice Department cases against both far-right extremists and ordinary rioters who appeared to have planned in advance to storm the Capitol.\n\nAgain, this conspiracy charge may in fact better describe the evidence against Mr. Trump, who, according to the committee, defrauded the public by making constant false claims that the election had been rigged against him.\n\nAnother charge the committee recommended against Mr. Trump and others was conspiracy to make false statements. That count, according to the panel, was warranted because Mr. Trump took part in a wide-ranging scheme to send to Congress and the National Archives fake slates of electors declaring that he was the victor in several key states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nThe most serious charge the panel has recommended against Mr. Trump is also likely to be the hardest to prove: insurrection. While the Justice Department has won a conviction on a related charge, seditious conspiracy, against Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia, and is set to try five members of another far-right group, the Proud Boys, for sedition, it has not charged anyone with insurrection in more than 900 criminal cases.\n\nStill, a federal judge in Washington laid the ground for a potential insurrection case against Mr. Trump in a ruling in February that permitted a series of Jan. 6-related civil cases filed against the former president to move forward.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge, Amit P. Mehta, said Mr. Trump was not merely exercising his First Amendment right to free speech when he called on the crowd listening to him on Jan. 6 to march on the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n\nJudge Mehta also found that there was a reasonable case to be made that Mr. Trump had aided and abetted those in the mob who assaulted the police at the Capitol — in part by waiting so long to call publicly for the rioters to calm down. One of the ways prosecutors could prove that Mr. Trump engaged in insurrection is by showing that he gave “aid and comfort” to other insurrectionists who took part in a rebellion against the government.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/us/politics/jan-6-committee-key-findings.html', 'Headline': 'Key Findings From the Jan. 6 Committee’s Report, Annotated', 'Snippet': 'The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol outlined 17 specific findings on Monday in the executive summary of its final report.', 'Full_text': 'The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol outlined 17 specific findings on Monday in the executive summary of its final report. Here are the findings, with additional context.\n\n1. Beginning election night and continuing through Jan. 6 and thereafter, Donald Trump purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions. These false claims provoked his supporters to violence on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: This reflects the committee’s finding that Mr. Trump’s repeated false claims that the election was rigged had both a political and financial motive. During its second hearing, the panel introduced evidence that Trump supporters donated nearly $100 million to Mr. Trump’s so-called Election Defense Fund but that the money flowed instead into a super PAC the president had created. It was not just “the big lie,” the committee said. It was also “the big rip-off.”\n\n2. Knowing that he and his supporters had lost dozens of election lawsuits, and despite his own senior advisers refuting his election fraud claims and urging him to concede his election loss, Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome.\n\nAnnotation: Mr. Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results of the election and lost all but one of them. Many of the suits, the committee determined, were brought even after some of Mr. Trump’s closest aides — including his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and his attorney general, William P. Barr — told him that there was no fraud that could have changed the outcome of the race.\n\n3. Despite knowing that such an action would be illegal, and that no state had or would submit an altered electoral slate, Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress’s joint session on Jan. 6.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Hundreds of federal prosecutions are still underway of rioters arrested for their actions that day—and hundreds of more cases are still expected ahead. Meanwhile, a Justice Department special counsel is weighing cases against Donald Trump, his inner circle, and potentially even congressional allies, not to mention various state cases still underway in places like Georgia.\n\nThe 841-page final report, which the committee issued just before Christmas, will surely stand as one of the most important documents of American history—a book-length examination of the closest the country has come to losing its centuries-old, proud tradition of peaceful transitions of power. Seemingly every page is filled with troubling details about the sheer breadth and corruption of Trump’s months-long and wide-ranging effort to overturn the election.\n\nIt’s worth remembering that the expectations for the committee were relatively low when it started work, but it’s fair to say that they made an enormous—even staggering, in certain revelations—contribution to our understanding of the period between the November 2020 election and noon on January 20, when Trump finally left office.\n\nNow, as the country marks the second anniversary of the culminating attack on the Capitol, here are 11 of the key points that stand out as historically important in the final report:\n\n1. Trump’s staff was more definitive that he lost than we understood\n\nAs Liz Cheney writes in her introduction, “Donald Trump’s own campaign officials told him early on that his claims of fraud were false. Donald Trump’s senior Justice Department officials—each appointed by Donald Trump himself—investigated the allegations and told him repeatedly that his fraud claims were false. Donald Trump’s White House lawyers also told him his fraud claims were false. From the beginning, Donald Trump’s fraud allegations were concocted nonsense, designed to prey upon the patriotism of millions of men and women who love our country.”\n\n2. The plot to overturn the election was far bigger than we knew\n\nThe January 6 Committee had previously outlined what it said was a seven-pronged plot to overturn the election through one effort or another. As Cheney wrote, “This was not a simple plan, but it was a corrupt one.” Parts of the effort were visible before Trump left office, like his phone call to the Georgia secretary of state to say, “I just want to find 11,780 votes,” but others, like the fake electors scheme, were not. All of them were more coordinated—and had more high-level inner-Trump-circle participation than we understood. Trump personally enlisted RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel, for instance, in the fake elector scheme.\n\n3. The violence could have been much worse\n\nThe committee’s report outlines in worrisome detail the number of weapons, including high-powered AR-15 rifles, carried by members of the crowd converging on the Capitol, as well as the vicious fighting at the Capitol as the Metropolitan Police lines collapsed (what the report calls “the first fighting withdrawal in the history of that force”) and rioters stormed into the building.\n\nAmong the 28,000 Trump rallygoers who went through the Secret Service magnetometers to view his speech at the Ellipse, officers confiscated “269 knives or blades, 242 cannisters of pepper spray, 18 brass knuckles, 18 tasers, 6 pieces of body armor, 3 gas masks, 30 batons or blunt instruments, and 17 miscellaneous items like scissors, needles, or screwdrivers.” But tens of thousands refused to go through the magnetometers and remained outside the secure viewing area—including those with heavier weapons. As the report notes, “Three men in fatigues from Broward County, Florida, brandished AR-15s in front of MPD officers on 14th Street and Independence Avenue. MPD advised over the radio that one individual was possibly armed with a ‘Glock’ at Fourteenth Street and Constitution Avenue, and another was possibly armed with a ‘rifle’ at Fifteenth Street and Constitution Avenue around 11:23 a.m.” And we now know from court cases that far-right extremist groups had pre-located weapons in Virginia as part of a “Quick Reaction Force.” (It’s worth noting that nowhere in the committee’s final report does it mention the pipe bombs also placed on Capitol Hill that day, a case where the FBI appears to still have no meaningful leads two years later and where it just upped the reward money to $500,000.)\n\nOne of the most vivid and striking passages in the report comes from Secret Service officials who listened to the radio reports coming from Vice President Pence’s detail inside the Capitol—the detail literally feared for their lives and began telling colleagues back at headquarters to say goodbye to their families and to tell their families they loved them. As one official said, “They’re running out of options, and they’re getting nervous. It sounds like that we came very close to either Service having to use lethal options or worse”; and, “They’re screaming and saying things, like, ‘say good-bye to the family.’”\n\nTo put a fine point on it: The Secret Service agents surrounding the Vice President believed they were about to be in a fight to the death to protect the man next in line for presidential succession. I’ve read and written about presidential security and history going back decades, and I can’t think of a parallel set of fears, except perhaps when Vice President Richard Nixon’s motorcade was attacked in Caracas in 1958, which was seen at the time as the “most violent attack ever perpetrated on a high American official while on foreign soil.”\n\n4. Big unknowns remain\n\nAs the committee notes, more than 30 witnesses invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, leading to some important holes in the committee’s knowledge. As the report says, “The Committee has substantial concerns regarding potential efforts to obstruct its investigation, including by certain counsel (some paid by groups connected to the former President) who may have advised clients to provide false or misleading testimony to the Committee.” It’ll be interesting whether any potential Justice Department indictments and investigations further pry back the lid on the White House and the role of people like Steve Bannon and Roger Stone.\n\n5. Parts of Trump’s plot targeted every level of government officials involved in counting and certifying elections\n\nOne of the most tragic hearings from the January 6 Committee focused last summer on the human toll of President Trump unleashing reckless personal attacks on the relatively anonymous local and state officials in battleground states who were charged with counting and certifying the votes—attacks so vicious and worrisome that some officials, who did nothing wrong and were serving in nonpartisan roles, fled their homes over safety concerns. And the final report is filled with page after page of details about the awful rhetoric—and worse—that Trump directed his supporters to unleash on officials in places like Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia.\n\nIn Arizona, the committee reports, “Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes testified before Congress that his family had ‘go-bags’ packed in case they needed to evacuate and that, because of the threats, he had moved his children ‘out of the family home at least once for three days in the wake of serious threats to [his] family’s safety.’” In Michigan, after Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and Republican House Speaker Lee Chatfield resisted Trump’s entreaties to overturn the state’s results, “[Trump] or his team maliciously tweeted out Shirkey’s personal cell phone number and a number for Chatfield that turned out to be wrong. Shirkey received nearly 4,000 text messages after that, and another private citizen reported being inundated with calls and texts intended for Chatfield.” As the committee says, the threats from Trump and myriad other supporters were un-American and beyond the pale: “This, again, is the conduct of thugs and criminals, each of whom should be held accountable.”\n\nBeyond the election officials themselves, the report has ample new detail about the Trump campaign’s efforts to create and forward to the National Archives and Congress slates of fake electors, people who would vote for Trump rather than Biden, as their states had properly certified. One of the interesting questions left after the January 6 report is whether state attorneys general or local prosecutors in any state will read and examine the evidence of the fake elector scheme for potential criminal charges too.\n\n6. Trump’s legal and criminal exposure is real\n\nThe January 6 Committee’s own criminal referrals made headlines in December, but the final report reminds us that federal judge David Carter also concluded as part of the court fight over the committee’s work that President Trump likely violated two criminal statutes: 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c) (corruptly obstructing, impeding or influencing Congress’s official proceeding to count electoral votes); and 18 U.S.C. § 371 (conspiring to defraud the United States). And indeed, any prosecutor looking at this report will see both plenty of evidence of corrupt acts and, notably, knowledge that Trump understood he was acting corruptly—because White House aides, lawyers, and campaign officials kept telling him he was doing so. As the committee wrote, “President Trump made corrupt, dishonest, and unlawful choices to pursue his plans.”\n\n7. The Justice Department came close to a meltdown\n\nAs someone who has written books about Nixon’s 1973 Saturday Night Massacre and the 2005 Comey-Mueller-Bush showdown over the NSA wiretapping program STELLAR WIND, my eyes were wide open as I read the sections about how Trump tried to install Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general in one of his final gambits to overturn the election—an event that almost caused the entire leadership of the Justice Department to resign. Bill Barr, of course, had resigned early, leaving acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen in charge of the department in January 2021, alongside acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue. The two faced down Trump as he tried to install Clark, who was willing to sign a letter saying DOJ had doubts about the election. Donoghue saw the possibility the letter “may very well have spiraled us into a constitutional crisis,” and White House counsel Pat Cipollone declared it a “murder-suicide pact.”\n\nWhile Trump persisted, he was informed that all of the other assistant attorneys general would resign if he pushed the change—but the committee’s work found that even as the showdown unfolded, “contemporaneous White House documents suggest that Clark had already [italics in original] been appointed as the acting attorney general.” Ultimately, Trump backed down as the potential mass resignations spiraled, and was told by assistant attorney general Steve Engel—himself a beloved Trump appointee—that “Clark would be here by himself with a hostile building, those folks who remained, and nothing would get done.” Clark, Engel said, would be leading a “graveyard.” Trump finally said, “It’s not going to be worth the breakage,” and dropped the plan.\n\n8. The US government had reliable, solid intelligence that bad stuff might happen on January 6—and it failed to take action\n\nThe committee makes clear in the second sentence of its executive summary that Trump owns everything that happened on January 6, saying its “overriding and straightforward conclusion: the central cause of January 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, whom many others followed. None of the events of January 6 would have happened without him.” But it’s also clear from the committee report that the US government, both its security agencies and top White House staff, failed to act on warnings that armed, violent individuals were coming to Washington on January 6 in response to the president’s tweet on December 19, 2020, summoning them and promising, “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nIn fact, no less than the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, remembers deputy secretary of defense David Norquist saying on a National Security Council call, “the greatest threat is a direct assault on the Capitol.” As Milley says, “I’ll never forget it.” The Secret Service was warned repeatedly, including on Christmas Eve in a document entitled “Armed and Ready, Mr. President” that summarized worrisome tweets, and at a December 30 internal intelligence briefing that specifically mentioned the fiery presidential tweet. The Capitol Police were warned, both by civilian extremism researchers as well as by the Secret Service itself, which forwarded warnings on December 29. The FBI issued a DC-area intelligence bulletin on January 5, warning of “Potential for Violence in Washington, D.C. Area in Connection with Planned ‘StopTheSteal’ Protest on 6 January 2021.” The bulletin even included maps of the Capitol that had been posted to a pro-Trump website. And there was a lot more beyond.\n\nIt’s clear from the committee’s evidence that the storming of the Capitol was much more of a strategic failure than an intelligence failure. As the committee says, “After President Trump’s signal, his supporters did not hide their plans for violence at the Capitol, and those threats made their way to national and local law enforcement agencies. As described in this report, the intelligence agencies did detect this planning, and they shared it with the White House and with the U.S. Secret Service.” One notable passage in the report documents the presidential staff's concerns with pending violence ahead of January 6, including a conversation where the director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe—a role specifically created after 9/11 to prevent other such surprise attacks—expressed concern. As Cassidy Hutchinson, former assistant to Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, reported, “He was concerned that it could spiral out of control and potentially be dangerous, either for our democracy or the way that things were going for the 6.” And yet, amazingly, the committee shows White House staff shirking their responsibility to inform the president and push him to de-escalate the showdown ahead of January 6.\n\nNotably, the committee singles out White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato, who oversaw security operations and comes across as uniquely slippery in the report: “Ornato had access to intelligence that suggested violence at the Capitol on January 6, and it was his job to inform Meadows and President Trump of that. Although Ornato told us that he did not recall doing so, the Select Committee found multiple parts of Ornato’s testimony questionable. The Select Committee finds it difficult to believe that neither Meadows nor Ornato told President Trump, as was their job, about the intelligence that was emerging as the January 6 rally approached.”\n\n9. Something happened in the presidential limo on January 6\n\nOne of the strange side-stories of Hutchinson’s blockbuster testimony was her anecdote in the public hearing on June 28, 2022, that Trump, after speaking to the rally on the Ellipse on January 6, got into an altercation with his Secret Service driver in his SUV afterward when he was told that they couldn’t go on to the Capitol.\n\nSeveral big-name political reporters (shamefully) suggested after Hutchinson’s testimony that anonymous Secret Service sources denied the encounter, but none of those sources ever went on the record—and the committee shows that those that did backed up Hutchinson’s suggestion that something happened. Hutchinson said that the second-hand story she was told indicated that Trump seemed to grab for the steering wheel and the neck of the Secret Service driver, and the Committee makes clear it ultimately “obtained evidence from several sources about a ‘furious interaction’ in the SUV.”\n\nAs the committee wrote, “The vast majority of witnesses who have testified before the Select Committee about this topic, including multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Metropolitan police, and national security and military officials in the White House, described President Trump’s behavior as ‘irate,’ ‘furious,’ ‘insistent,’ ‘profane’ and ‘heated.’” If there’s someone who is lying about what happened in the limo, it’s not Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\n10. Trump’s silence during the 187 minutes of the attack seems calculated\n\nThe committee focused extensively in its hearings and investigation on the “187 minutes” during which Trump remained silent and out of sight while his supporters moved toward the Capitol and stormed the building, interrupting the certification of the Electoral College. The committee frames Trump’s silence as a last-ditch effort to delay or overturn the election—a last-ditch effort that almost succeeded.\n\nTrump knew it was his last chance, as the committee writes: “By the afternoon of January 6, virtually all of President Trump’s efforts to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election had failed. Virtually all the lawsuits had already been lost. Vice President Mike Pence had refused Trump’s pressure to stop the count of certain electoral votes. State officials and legislators had refused to reverse the election outcomes in every State where Trump and his team applied pressure. The Justice Department’s investigations of alleged election fraud had all contradicted Trump’s allegations. The only factor working in Trump’s favor that might succeed in materially delaying the counting of electoral votes for President-elect Biden was the violent crowd at the Capitol. And for much of the afternoon of January 6, it appeared that the crowd had accomplished that purpose.”\n\nThe committee’s report documents starkly how Trump literally erased and stopped history from being recorded as he waited to see how the storming of the Capitol would unfold: He stopped the White House photographer from taking pictures between 1:30 and 4 pm, there are no official records—as there should be—of his telephone calls that afternoon despite his assistant saying “he was placing lots of calls,” and, “the President’s official Daily Diary contains no information for this afternoon between the hours of 1:19 pm and 4:03 pm, at the height of the worst attack on the seat of the United States Congress in over two centuries.” These are huge historical holes, as anyone who studies the presidency knows—the daily diary usually tracks every single interaction a president has to the minute, including who stepped into or out of what room when, when telephone calls were attempted, whether they were successful, etc. And we have these records from the darkest and most fraught moments of American history—the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Saturday Night Massacre, 9/11, and so on. Trump’s foresight to stop these records on January 6 is as solid evidence of a mens rea, a guilty mind, as you could imagine.\n\n11. Trump did lasting damage to our democracy\n\nIt might be easy to say that after the 2022 midterms roundly rejected the worst Trump follow-on election deniers that the threat of what he introduced to American politics in 2020 is over—and indeed, it does seem like the temperature on the existential threat to our democracy has been turned down. But reading through the report, it’s clear that, time and again, Trump came really close to succeeding.\n\nAs the committee writes, “Vice President Pence, along with many of the appointed officials who surrounded Donald Trump, worked to defeat many of the worst parts of Trump’s plan to overturn the election. This was not a certainty. It is comforting to assume that the institutions of our Republic will always withstand those who try to defeat our Constitution from within. But our institutions are only strong when those who hold office are faithful to our Constitution. We do not know what would have happened if the leadership of the Department of Justice declared, as Donald Trump requested, that the election was ‘corrupt,’ if Jeff Clark’s letters to State Legislatures had been sent, if Pat Cipollone, Jeff Rosen, Richard Donoghue, Steve Engel, and others were not serving as guardrails on Donald Trump’s abuses.”\n\nNow there’s a roadmap for how to succeed next time—and others across the country are still pushing to make it easier to overturn the next election.\n\nWhile Congress did get the Electoral Reform Act through in the final weeks of last year—legislation that should make it harder for the next would-be election-stealer to succeed—there are a lot of holes still in our democracy. And there’s plenty of reason to believe, particularly given the stunning dysfunction of the GOP’s first days of its majority in the House this week, that the period for post-Trump reform is already over. It took the better part of a decade after Watergate to enact the many different reforms that addressed Nixon’s abuses of power and the worst violations of civil liberties and human rights by US intelligence agencies. Post-Trump, the country didn’t even get two years.""}}",96.25,3

They\'re seeking an injunction that would ban cities from ""coercing private venues from entering into facilities use contracts with Plaintiffs for future political rallies.""

O n a Tuesday afternoon in late April, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene walks into the seventh-floor congressional office belonging to Representative Matt Gaetz ...', 'Full_text': ""On a Tuesday afternoon in late April, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene walks into the seventh-floor congressional office belonging to Representative Matt Gaetz, settles into a high-backed black leather chair, and fits a pair of headphones over her blonde hair. The taping is about to begin for the 38th episode of Gaetz’s “Firebrand” podcast, and Greene is the high-wattage guest star.\n\nGreene has come straight from Dulles Airport, so Gaetz takes a minute to catch her up on today’s topics before the recording starts. There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her. She knows really well how to wield power.” Why vote against a man you’ve already got wrapped around your little finger?\n\n“The critique of McCarthy is not that he has ignored us, or pretended like we don’t exist,” Gaetz adds with a broad grin. “In fact, he’s highly responsive to us.”\n\nThe MAGA Squad: They’re here. They’re weird. And pretty soon, they may be in control of the GOP Congress—if they aren’t already.\n\nWith reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.dailyrepublic.com/news/reps-matt-gaetz-and-marjorie-taylor-greene-sue-anaheim-and-riverside-over-canceled-rally-los/article_d2ef2c3d-d6ec-5bc7-8138-a45b8d176f62.html', 'Headline': 'Reps.

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/j6-committee-failed-to-preserve-records-has-no-data-on-capitol-hill-security-failures-gop-charges', 'Headline': 'J6 Committee failed to preserve records, has no data on Capitol Hill ...', 'Snippet': 'The GOP head of the committee investigating the security failures of January 6 says the Nancy Pelosi-created committee did not preserve the documents as it was required.', 'Full_text': 'FIRST ON FOX: The House select committee that investigated the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021 failed to adequately preserve documents, data and video depositions – including communications it had with the Biden White House that are still missing – according to the Republican lawmaker overseeing the GOP investigation into the committee\'s work.\n\nThe now-disbanded ""J6"" committee, which was run by Democrats and included only two GOP members, has also failed to provide any evidence that it looked into Capitol Hill security failures on the day of the riot, Rep.

Accordingly, and contrary to your letter’s implication, the Select Committee was not obligated to archive all video recordings of transcribed interviews or depositions. Based on guidance from House authorities, the Select Committee determined that the written transcripts provided by nonpartisan, professional official reporters, which the witnesses and Select Committee staff had the opportunity to review for errata, were the official, permanent records of transcribed interviews and depositions for the purposes of rule VII.""\n\n""He\'s saying they decided they didn\'t have to,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. ""It was clear in law they had to especially and, I mean, if there was any question, the fact that they used the videos in the hearings would dictate that it had to be preserved. The more we go in the more we\'re realizing that there\'s things that we don\'t have. We don\'t have anything about security failures at the Capitol, we don\'t have the videos of the depositions.""\n\nRepublicans have long maintained that many security warnings were ignored leading up to the Capitol Hill riot which was supported by Steven A.

""The Democrat-led investigation in the House of Representatives, however, has disregarded those institutional failings that exposed the Capitol to violence that day.""\n\nAdditionally, Loudermilk said he came across a letter that was not turned over to his committee from Thompson to White House special counsel Richard Sauber and DHS discussing an ""agreement"" made between the J6 committee and the executive branch to interview personnel whose names were later redacted.\n\n""No version of the letter to Mr. Sauber — either redacted or unredacted — or the letter to the DHS General Counsel was archived by the Select Committee or provided to this Committee,"" Loudermilk wrote to Thompson.

It said changes to USCP intelligence protocols in the lead-up to Jan. 6 ""caused confusion and rendered a key USCP component ineffective"" during the mob violence.\n\nRepublicans accused former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving of being ""compromised by politics,"" coordinating closely with Pelosi and her staff but leaving GOP lawmakers out of discussions about security. The report said Democratic leaders were concerned over the ""optics"" of deploying the National Guard in response to the riot, given the Black Lives Matter riots that took place in the summer of 2020. The GOP lawmakers alleged these concerns prevented early deployment of the National Guard.\n\n""To make matters worse, systemic issues have crippled the security apparatus for years. USCP line officers were under-trained and ill-equipped to protect the Capitol complex,"" the report said. ""One officer testified to investigators that he went into the fight on January 6, 2021 with nothing but his USCP-issued baseball cap. Even if every USCP officer had been at work that day, their numbers would still have been insufficient to hold off the rioters due to a lack of training and equipment. The USCP was set up to fail, and there have been scant signs of progress toward addressing these weaknesses.""\n\nRepublicans said the evidence gathered in their report came from witnesses and USCP sources whose identities are protected for fear of retaliation. Additionally, the House investigators interviewed USCP Chief Tom Manger, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker, and the Assistant Director of the Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division Julie Farnam. The investigation also relied on public documents and news reports to supplement their findings.\n\nDEMOCRATS RELEASE REPORT ON TRUMP TAX RETURNS, REVEALING INCOME, TAXES PAID, IRS AUDIT\n\nThe GOP report is meant to supplement a bipartisan report released by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and the Committee on Rules and Administration last year. That report identified several security, planning and response failures leading up to the riot, including FBI and Homeland Security intelligence officials neglecting to warn of potential violence and USPC unpreparedness.\n\n""The intelligence failures, coupled with the Capitol Police Board’s failure to request National Guard assistance prior to January 6th, meant the District of Columbia National Guard (DCNG) was not activated, staged, and prepared to quickly respond to an attack on the Capitol,"" the Senate report found.\n\nPelosi has repeatedly denied GOP allegations that she or her office prevented the National Guard from deploying, or otherwise ignored threats of violence leading up to the riot.\n\nThe Democrat-led Jan. 6 select committee is expected release its final report on the Capitol riot Thursday. Seven Democrats and the two anti-Trump Republicans on the committee, Reps. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., have for months alleged that the ""insurrection"" mounted by former President Trump\'s supporters was the final step in his plan to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nNAACP PRESIDENT TWEETS ALL HE WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS IS ‘DONALD TRUMP IN HANDCUFFS’\n\nThe committee released a 154-page executive summary of their findings on Monday and referred criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department.\n\n""What Donald Trump proceeded to do after the 2020 election is something no president had done before in our country,"" said Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. ""In a staggering betrayal of his oath, Donald Trump attempted a plan that led to an attack on a pillar of our democracy.""\n\nThe panel argued during the committee\'s final meeting that Trump\'s conduct before and after Jan. 6 was ""unlawful.""

In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.c-span.org/video/?530535-1/capitol-police-chief-testifies-january-6-security-failures', 'Headline': 'Former Capitol Police Chief Testifies on January 6 Security Failures', 'Snippet': 'Former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund testified on security failures related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol before the House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight.

Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and holds a phone. Pence says on speaker phone: ""I’m at the Capitol building. I’m literally standing with the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police. … They believe that the House and the Senate will be able to reconvene in roughly an hour.""\n\nThe second clip shows Schumer holding the phone with Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, listening as Pence says the same three sentences.\n\n""Exact same recording. Two different shots. One with Grassley — one without Grassley,"" text on the video read.\n\nThe Instagram post’s caption said, ""Some of you are confused. It’s called a movie, with great actors, central casting ‘cause it’s all a show.""\n\n(Screengrab from Instagram)\n\nAnother Instagram post, also shared Nov. 19, showed the same video clips of Pelosi and made a similar claim that the Capitol attack was a setup. These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\nAlthough the video clips in the Instagram posts appear to have the same audio recording, a full video of the Congress members’ phone call with Pence shows that’s not so.\n\nA short clip of the conversation with Pence was released Oct. 13, 2022, by the House select committee on the Jan. 6 attack. CNN obtained and published a longer video of that conversation the same day. Both videos were filmed by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and Nancy Pelosi’s daughter.\n\nIn the full video, Nancy Pelosi holds the cellphone beside Schumer as Pence says the Capitol Police chief believes the House and Senate will be able to reconvene in an hour. Pence later says he will call Schumer, unless Schumer is present, and Pelosi hands the phone to Schumer.\n\nAt this point, about a minute and a half later, Grassley walks up to Pelosi and Schumer and listens to Pence relay the same information about when Congress can reconvene. But the audio from earlier in the clip is not repeated, as it is in the Instagram posts.\n\nThis footage shows congressional leaders coordinating with the vice president to resume certifying the 2020 election after rioters stormed the Capitol. It does not prove that the events of Jan. 6, 2021, were scripted or part of a movie.\n\nIn the nearly three years since the Capitol attack, PolitiFact has fact-checked numerous false claims about the attack and found no evidence that it was contrived. Falsehoods about the attack were named PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year. It was a real event with real consequences.\n\nHundreds of people, fueled partly by the false belief that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen, stormed the Capitol as Congress was certifying the election results. The rioters, many armed and clad in Trump-branded apparel and combat gear, scaled walls, broke windows, forced their way into the building and repeatedly clashed with police.\n\nOne woman was fatally shot by police during the attack. And five police officers who served at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, died soon after, The New York Times reported.\n\nIn February 2021, the cost of the attack, including repairs, enhanced security and increased mental health services, was estimated to exceed $30 million, The New York Times reported.\n\nSince the attack, more than 1,100 people have been charged with federal crimes, including obstruction of Congress, use of a deadly or dangerous weapon, and causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Of those, 714 have pleaded guilty and 709 have been sentenced, according to an NPR analysis.\n\nWe rate the claim that videos of Nancy Pelosi from Jan. 6, 2021, show the Capitol attack was staged False.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/politics/republican-january-6-report-capitol-police/index.html', 'Headline': 'Republicans release their own US Capitol riot report focused on ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'House Republicans on Wednesday released a report focused on security failures at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, highlighting well-documented breakdowns in intelligence sharing, Capitol ...', 'Full_text': 'House Republicans on Wednesday released a report focused on security failures at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, highlighting well-documented breakdowns in intelligence sharing, Capitol security and coordination between various law enforcement agencies that responded that day.\n\nTheir primary recommendation centers around reforming the US Capitol Police Board and bolstering congressional oversight of the Capitol Police force – two issues that were identified by lawmakers of both parties in the wake of the January 6 attack.\n\nBut the GOP report is silent on other efforts to disrupt the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election and selective in its criticism of political leaders and their culpability in the security breakdowns on January 6. The report resurfaces largely unfounded allegations to cast blame on Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while glossing over former President Donald Trump’s own role.\n\nRepublicans cast the report as a rebuttal to the House select committee’s investigation into January 6 as they are set to take control of the chamber and endeavor to take back the narrative. Republican lawmakers have said the security failures are paramount and that the select committee overstepped its mandate in its 17-month probe.\n\nThe Democratic-led select committee had planned to release its final report on Wednesday but has delayed the rollout until Thursday. An executive summary released on Monday lays blame for the insurrection squarely on Trump.\n\nThe GOP report comes from the five Republicans who House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy initially appointed to serve on the select committee before deciding members of his party would not participate.\n\nIt includes a timeline of events that occurred on January 6, making no mention of the fact that Trump waited hours before calling on the rioters to leave the US Capitol that day and omitting incendiary remarks he made at the rally preceding the attack.\n\nInstead, the report paints Trump as only encouraging his supporters at the White House Ellipse to march to the US Capitol and demonstrate “peacefully,” noticeably omitting other parts of the speech, including when he encouraged rally goers to “fight like hell.”\n\nSimilarly, the timeline includes a tweet Trump sent after the Capitol had been breached, saying: “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”\n\nMissing from the report is Trump’s tweet in which he eventually told the rioters to leave the Capitol – several hours after the deadly riot began.\n\nThe House select committee has revealed testimony from several former White House officials saying Trump repeatedly refused to call off the rioters despite being asked to do so by a number of his closest advisers.\n\nThe GOP report also doesn’t address Trump’s claim that he issued a directive prior to January 6 to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to the Capitol that day.\n\nTrump’s former Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, in an interview with the select committee, denied Trump gave him formal orders authorizing the deployment of National Guard troops to the Capitol on January 6.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/politics/security-failures-january-6-committee-blue-team/index.html', 'Headline': 'January 6 committee probes security failures as GOP counter ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Davis recently wrote to Pelosi to say his team had reviewed Capitol Hill security footage in the lead-up to January 6, 2021, and found no evidence of Republican lawmakers organizing ...', 'Full_text': 'More than 80 officials from law enforcement and federal agencies have testified to the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, including members of the Secret Service, in what investigators believe will be the most extensive review yet of security failures that led to the US Capitol breach.\n\nThe House select committee’s so-called “blue team” is focused on understanding the threats leading up to attack, how intelligence was shared among law enforcement and their preparations. In addition to depositions, the team has thousands of documents from more than a dozen agencies that other security reviews didn’t have, two committee aides tell CNN.\n\nWhile much of what the Democrat-led committee has made public so far has centered around the plotting by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election, aides and lawmakers say this behind-the-scenes review might lead to the bulk of their legislative recommendations and have the most lasting impact.\n\n“We really need to bear down on those things that we think need to be done from strengthening the windows, so they’re unbreakable, all the way up to potential reforms of the electoral count act and protection of the right to vote,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat on the committee. “We need to spend some real time talking about the policy recommendations and dimension of this.”\n\nAt the same time, Republicans have launched their own investigation into security lapses on January 6, 2021, and plan to release recommendations. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and GOP lawmakers involved in the effort have made clear they will focus, at least in part, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s role.\n\n“The reports that come out of the select committee are based upon anything that’s anti-President Trump,” said Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican who has used his position as the ranking member on the House Administration Committee to look into security issues.\n\nThe competing investigations underscore that January 6 remains a polarizing issue – turning even typically nonpartisan issues like security into partisan flash points – and that questions remain about how breakdowns happened and what improvements can be made to ensure such an attack never happens again.\n\nSecurity lapses scrutinized\n\nOver the past year, several reviews have examined various aspects of law enforcement failures, but some ran into challenges collecting information and none has been able to fully assess the federal, local and congressional response as a whole.\n\nFor example, congressional aides who worked on a Senate report released in June said that federal law enforcement agencies didn’t provide all of the information investigators requested. And the Capitol Police inspector general produced several reports but noted investigators spoke to about 35 officers, despite efforts to interview dozens more.\n\nThe inspectors general from the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security also plan to produce reports on their findings.\n\nThe House select committee’s blue team review is much broader than previous ones, aides say.\n\n“There’s a tremendous amount of more information that we have, that the Senate report did not have or any of the IG reports do not have in terms of the amount of interviews we’ve conducted,” one of the aides told CNN.\n\nThe committee’s sweeping probe includes several investigative teams, each with their own color designation. The green team, for example, is tasked with tracking money, including the funding behind the pro-Trump rallies that preceded the attack. In all, they have interviewed more than 750 people and subpoenaed thousands of records.\n\nIn contrast to the work of other teams, some of whom have had to confront recalcitrant witnesses and lawsuits seeking to block their subpoenas, the aide said witnesses for the blue team have been cooperative – and largely content to stay out of the public eye.\n\n“I don’t have folks storming out of my (depositions) and then going to the press,” the aide said.\n\n“It’s just it’s people who are genuinely concerned about what happened and want to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”\n\nAides say the witnesses have included current and former law enforcement officials, from first responders to high-ranking officers, and from the Secret Service, which has publicly revealed little about their operations that day.\n\nThe team expects to propose legislative fixes as well as administrative changes related to law enforcement and physical security at the Capitol.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a member of the committee, told CNN those proposals could address streamlining the process by which the Capitol Police chief gets approval to call on the National Guard, which led to issues on January 6, and how intelligence-gathering and information-sharing happens across various agencies. As chair of the House Administration Committee, which oversees Capitol Police, Lofgren has already spearheaded efforts to improve Capitol security.\n\n“Along with the entire investigation, we want to know everything that led up to and on the day of the 6th,” Lofgren said. “Now, part of that obviously is the law enforcement preparation for January 6, how they responded to the riot as it was happening, the shortcomings, and what recommendations we want to improve the situation in the future.”\n\nGOP investigation\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, McCarthy pledged last year that Republicans would pursue their own “investigation of the facts” after Pelosi rejected his picks to sit on the House Select Committee. Since then, two of the three Republicans vetoed by Pelosi have quietly undertaken the task.\n\nDavis and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana have teamed up to informally investigate security failures. No Republican member can subpoena witness testimony or documents without the help of Democrats, so any information they have collected has been through voluntary cooperation.\n\nDavis declined to specify who he and his fellow Republicans have interviewed or what documents they’ve collected but noted several whistleblowers have come forward through a website his committee launched in the months following the riot. Davis said he doesn’t have faith the House select committee will dig deeply enough.\n\n“I don’t think enough focus is going to be placed upon the failures of the security apparatus pre-January 6 that needs to be investigated,” Davis said, recalling that he got a security briefing from Capitol Police on January 5 in his office. “There was nothing in that briefing that would have led me to believe that I would have witnessed what I saw on January 6.”\n\nTwo sources close to the GOP investigation say they have interviewed dozens of witnesses, including rank-and-file law enforcement and top brass. Their report may be timed to coincide with the House Select Committee’s public hearings, the sources said – illustrating that they see their investigative effort as a counterweight to the committee’s work.\n\nDavis recently wrote to Pelosi to say his team had reviewed Capitol Hill security footage in the lead-up to January 6, 2021, and found no evidence of Republican lawmakers organizing “reconnaissance” tours as has been previously suggested by certain Democratic members.\n\nLofgren said Republicans are politicizing the issue of Capitol Hill security and discredited the GOP notion that Pelosi is somehow responsible for any breakdowns.\n\n“It’s obviously B.S., and it’s totally motivated by their effort to turn everything into a political game,” Lofgren said.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-transcripts-detail-numerous-warning-signs-potential-violence-cap-rcna63647', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 transcripts detail numerous warning signs of potential for ...', 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — Transcripts of interviews with law enforcement officials released this week by the Jan. 6 committee reveal the panel learned that numerous security concerns had been raised in the ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Transcripts of interviews with law enforcement officials released this week by the Jan. 6 committee reveal the panel learned that numerous security concerns had been raised in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMany of the revelations came in interviews with high-ranking individuals such as former Secret Service and White House official Anthony Ornato; former executive director of the National Capitol Threat Intelligence Center Donell Harvin; former Deputy FBI Director David Bowdich; Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee; former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund; and House Staff Director Jamie Fleet.\n\nBut some of the new information came from questions posed to those officials by Jan. 6 committee staffers based on details they had gathered in the course of the 18-month investigation.\n\nMuch of that information, mentioned by investigators during the interviews, was not included in the appendix of the committee\'s final report that addressed law enforcement and intelligence failures. For the most part, Jan. 6 committee leaders decided against focusing the final report on how law enforcement came to be so underprepared for the attack.\n\nThe new revelations add to a growing body of evidence from news reports and court proceedings that illustrate how federal law enforcement officials were in possession of ample information that indicated Jan. 6 was going to be violent. As NBC News first reported last month, staffers were informed that chapters prepared by committee staff — including material focused on law enforcement and intelligence failures — would be cut from the final version.\n\nAmong the revelations from the transcripts: One FBI employee wrote in a Dec. 26, 2020, memo about planning for Jan. 6 that was unfolding on a pro-Trump forum called TheDonald.\n\n“They think they will have a large enough group to march into DC armed, and it will outnumber the police so they can’t be stopped,"" read the notification in the eGuardian system, which is meant to help federal, state and local law enforcement officials coordinate. ""They believe that since the election was stolen, that it’s their constitutional right to over take the government and during this coup no U.S. laws apply. Another group of Proud Boys will be in DC already and are planning on blocking the roads with their cars in order to stop traffic.""\n\nNBC News previously reported that one of the FBI’s own confidential sources informed the bureau on the day that Trump sent his Dec. 19, 2020, “will be wild” tweet about Jan. 6 that far-right groups saw it as a “call to arms.” The FBI received numerous tips about the potential for violence on Jan. 6, including from the son of a Texas man who ultimately came to the Capitol with a gun, and the bureau briefed other law enforcement entities about threats, including intelligence that suggested the Oath Keepers had set up armed ""quick reaction forces"" in Virginia that were set to come into D.C. at Trump\'s command. Two members of the Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy at a trial that ended last month, and three others pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee transcripts detailed the challenges facing the FBI in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Days before the attack, the FBI lost use of the program it had been using to track threats on social media, as the bureau transitioned to a new product to gather open source information. An FBI intelligence analyst raised concerns about that on New Year\'s Eve, as threats about Jan. 6 continued to increase.\n\n“We have an urgent need for the DataMinr replacement to be on and active starting on January 4th in support of some potential issues in the D.C. area,” the analyst wrote in a Dec. 31, 2020, email. “The sudden discontinuation is most untimely as much of our crisis response funnels through DataMinr.”\n\nBowdich, in his interview with Jan. 6 investigators, said there was a lot happening at the bureau in the days before the attack: There had been a major cyber intrusion; a bomb had gone off in downtown Nashville, Tenn.; the first anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani was approaching; and the bureau was receiving a lot of intelligence about the potential for violence, much of which was publicly available on social media.\n\n“I wish you could see the volume,” Bowdich told the committee, referring to the number of threats the FBI reviews. “It is off the charts. ... One of our greatest challenges is social media today.”\n\nThe bureau did make efforts to try to disrupt extremists\' travel to D.C.; the FBI\'s Domestic Terrorism Operations Section messaged all domestic terrorism assistant special agents in charge across the country to determine whether any of the extremists they were watching were planning to go to D.C. on Jan. 6.\n\nUltimately, the FBI set up a national command post for the event inside the Strategic Information Operations Center at FBI headquarters in Washington.\n\n“The noise seemed to be growing as we got closer to the event, and it reached a point of we just didn’t know what was going to happen,"" Bowdich said. ""Sometimes you just get a sense for it when you’ve been doing it.”\n\nSome of those officials interviewed by the committee about the intelligence failures made clear they thought there were problems that needed to be fixed, both before Jan. 6 and going forward.\n\n“[Y]ou don’t need intelligence. I mean, everybody knew that people were directed to come there by the President. November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, who was head of the D.C. National Guard on Jan. 6. The information publicly available made clear that Jan. 6 “was going to be a big deal,” he said.\n\nSund, the former Capitol Police chief who resigned the day after the attack, said that intelligence he received didn\'t ""send up a bunch of red flags for me"" because most protests target Congress. Harvin, the former chief of homeland security and intelligence for D.C., told the committee that Sund shouldn\'t characterize what happened as an intelligence failure, but as a failure to act on intelligence.\n\n“He said it was intelligence failure,"" Harvin said. ""It may have been an intelligence failure on his agency’s part and a failure to properly contextualize and pervade the threat environment, but it wasn’t an intelligence failure at large.”\n\nContee, the D.C. police chief, said there needed to be better sharing of intelligence, and that he would have liked to have known about a Capitol Police report about some of the threats related to Jan. 6.\n\n“I don’t think I want to get notified about Armageddon through an email,"" Contee said. ""That would not be my preferred notification, right?”\n\nWhen asked about what she thought the intelligence failures were, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was blunt.\n\n""People didn\'t think that these white nationalists would overthrow the Capitol building,"" the Democratic mayor said.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check/jan-6-capitol-pelosi', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist', 'Snippet': 'Efforts to blame Speaker Nancy Pelosi for security failures are baseless. ...

Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds.

He asked guest U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., ""Why would the IRS need millions of dollars worth of guns and ammo?""\n\nGaetz replied, ""Well, Joe Biden is raising taxes, disarming Americans, so of course they are arming up the IRS like they are preparing to take Fallujah.""\n\nGaetz\'s comments about Biden came after Carlson cited reports from 2018 and 2020 about IRS spending on weapons and ammunition — expenditures that happened before Biden took office. Gaetz went on to say that the IRS has also spent $731,000 this year — he didn’t say specifically on what — ""to quite literally weaponize your country against you.""\n\nIn June, Gaetz, who has co-sponsored a bill to prevent the IRS from purchasing ammunition, made a similar allegation in an interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters. Then he accused the Biden administration of suppressing access to ammunition ""for regular Americans"" while ""scooping up all of the ammo they can possibly find."" In that interview, he said the IRS spent $725,000 this year on ammunition. He also cited that figure in a June press release about his bill.\n\nA spokesperson for Gaetz did not return a request for comment regarding the grounds for his claim.\n\nHere’s what we know: The IRS did spend about $725,000 on ammunition this year. But that is not unusual, and is actually a bit less than what was spent in other recent years. These purchases are not new or unique to the Biden administration — they have been made for an IRS division that has been armed for more than a century.\n\nThe IRS buys guns and ammunition yearly for IRS Criminal Investigation, the division that has jurisdiction over federal tax crimes. The people who work there are not the typical auditors that Americans facing routine audits will encounter. The vast majority of those audits are done by mail.\n\nThe division in which agents are armed was established in 1919, when it was called the Intelligence Unit, according to the division’s 2019 report. The unit famously investigated gangster Al Capone, who was convicted on tax evasion charges. It was renamed the IRS Criminal Investigation in 1978.\n\nSpecial agents in the division investigate a number of crimes, including money laundering, cybercrime, financial fraud and narcotics-related crimes. Recently they’ve been part of a multiagency task force tracking down assets of Russian oligarchs.\n\nThe division had 2,046 special agents in 2021, a little less than the 2,159 agents it had in 2017. Those numbers haven’t changed much in five years, according to annual reports available on its website; the 2022 report has not been published.\n\nThe numbers haven’t changed much in decades. In the division’s 2017 report, then-division chief Don Fort wrote, ""We have the same number of special agents — around 2,200 — as we did 50 years ago.""\n\nSpecial agents train for weeks at the National Criminal Investigation Training Academy in Georgia, the 2021 report said. That includes firearms training and handgun qualifications for agents, which is a big reason for the large orders for ammunition.\n\nThe IRS Criminal Investigation division ordered $725,460 worth of ammunition in fiscal year 2022, according to figures provided to PolitiFact by Justin Cole, the division’s communications director. That’s slightly more than the money spent in 2021 ($655,013) and 2020 ($616,619).\n\nAccording to a 2018 report (page 75 of the PDF) to Congress by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on firearms and ammunition purchases by federal law enforcement agencies, the IRS spent about $1.1 million on ammunition in 2011 and about $1 million in 2012. From 2010 to 2017, it averaged $712,500 in ammunition spending. The report described its numbers as minimum values because agencies reported challenges compiling requested data.\n\nThe report also said the IRS had 4,461 firearms and about 5 million rounds of ammunition in stock as of November 2017. The report notes the numbers don’t include weapons or ammunition purchased for a small, separate IRS police force of fewer than a dozen officers that provides security at the Enterprise Computing Center in Martinsburg, West Virginia.\n\nThe report’s authors noted that officials at law enforcement agencies said they keep ammunition on hand to last for several months for use in training and operation, and that they order large quantities because sometimes there’s a long wait, up to a year, before the orders can be fulfilled.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office said that it does not have more recent data available.\n\nThe IRS is not the only government agency that some people may be surprised to find purchasing guns and ammunition for law enforcement officers.\n\nGaetz mentioned the Department of Agriculture, which buys weapons and ammunition for the U.S. Forest Service, and the Department of Education, which purchases them for its Office of the Inspector General. The GAO report lists several others, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAs to Gaetz’s claim that these efforts come because Biden is ""raising taxes and disarming Americans,"" there is no evidence that the IRS’ longstanding spending on weapons and ammunition is connected to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions. Biden supports a House bill to ban certain assault weapons, but that measure is not likely to pass in the Senate and, even if it did, does not amount to a plan to wholesale disarm American citizens.\n\nBiden’s plan to raise taxes targets corporations and high-earning money managers, assuming the Inflation Reduction Act passes the U.S. House. That bill may have secondary effects on average Americans that are hard to measure, experts told PolitiFact. But, even so, the routine audits the IRS performs on average Americans do not involve those armed agents who deal with criminal investigations.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGaetz claimed that the government is arming up the IRS because the president is raising taxes and disarming Americans, citing the amount of money spent on ammunition by the agency this year.\n\nBut there’s been no significant increase in spending on ammunition, and Gaetz ignores that the IRS Criminal Investigation division has existed for more than a century and that the weapons and ammunition are for those law enforcement officers. That division had fewer special agents in 2021 than it had in 2017, but the number of agents has stayed about the same for decades.\n\nThe $725,000 the division spent this year on ammunition, much of which is used for agents’ firearms training, is only slightly more than was spent in recent years and less than was spent a decade ago. There is no evidence this continued tradition of spending by the IRS has any connection to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions.\n\nWe rate this claim False.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nraila.org/articles/20230315/bidens-executive-order-targeting-gun-ownership', 'Headline': 'Biden’s Executive Order Targeting Gun Ownership - NRA-ILA', 'Snippet': 'Wednesday, March 15, 2023. Support NRA-ILA. On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep. Media and gun control ...', 'Full_text': 'On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nMedia and gun control groups that beforehand had been salivating over the idea that the measure would impose “universal background checks” for firearm transfers had to content themselves with a vague directive for Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop a “plan” to move in that direction.\n\nAnd while the order’s other provisions were similarly vague and insubstantial, there is no doubt what it all adds up to: antagonism toward gun ownership is now the official policy of the U.S. government’s Executive Branch.\n\nThe good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done. Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them.

He also made a false claim about the extent of his support from environmental groups. And he used incorrect figures about the population of Africa, his own travel history and how much renewable energy Texas uses.\n\nHere is a fact check of these claims, plus a fact check on a Biden exaggeration about guns. The White House declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nGuns\n\nBeau Biden and red flag laws\n\nIn a Friday speech at the National Safer Communities Summit in Connecticut, Biden spoke of how a gun control law he signed in 2022 has provided federal funding for states to expand the use of gun control tools like “red flag” laws, which allow the courts to temporarily seize the guns of people who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. After mentioning red flag laws, Biden invoked his late son Beau Biden, who served as attorney general of Delaware, and said: “As my son was the first to enforce when he was attorney general.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. Delaware did not have a red flag law when Beau Biden was state attorney general from 2007 to 2015. The legislation that created Delaware’s red flag program was named the Beau Biden Gun Violence Prevention Act, but it was passed in 2018, three years after Beau Biden died of brain cancer. (In 2013, Beau Biden had pushed for a similar bill, but it was rejected by the state Senate.) The president has previously said, correctly, that a Delaware red flag law was named after his son.\n\nDelaware was far from the first state to enact a red flag law. Connecticut passed the first such state law in the country in 1999.\n\nStabilizing braces\n\nIn the same speech, the president spoke confusingly of his administration’s effort to make it more difficult for Americans to purchase stabilizing braces, devices that are attached to the rear of pistols, most commonly AR-15-style pistols, and make it easier to fire them one-handed.\n\n“Put a pistol on a brace, and it…turns into a gun,” Biden said. “Makes them where you can have a higher-caliber weapon – a higher-caliber bullet – coming out of that gun. It’s essentially turning it into a short-barreled rifle, which has been a weapon of choice by a number of mass shooters.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claims that a stabilizing brace turns a pistol into a gun and increases the caliber of a gun or bullet are false. A pistol is, obviously, already a gun, and “a pistol brace does not have any effect on the caliber of ammunition that a gun fires or anything about the basic functioning of the gun itself,” said Stephen Gutowski, a CNN contributor who is the founder of the gun policy and politics website The Reload.\n\nBiden’s assertion that the addition of a stabilizing brace can “essentially” turn a pistol into a short-barreled rifle is subjective; it’s the same argument his administration’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has made in support of its attempt to subject the braces to new controls. The administration’s regulatory effort is being challenged in the courts by gun rights advocates.\n\nGun manufacturers and lawsuits\n\nRepeating a claim he made in his 2022 State of the Union address and on other occasions, Biden said at a campaign fundraiser in California on Monday: “The only industry in America you can’t sue is the – is the gun manufacturers.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false, as CNN and other fact-checkers have previously noted. Gun manufacturers are not entirely exempt from being sued, nor are they the only industry with some liability protections. Notably, there are significant liability protections for vaccine manufacturers and, at present, for people and entities involved in making, distributing or administering Covid-19 countermeasures such as vaccines, tests and treatments.\n\nUnder the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, gun manufacturers cannot be held liable for the use of their products in crimes. However, gun manufacturers can still be held liable for (and thus sued for) a range of things, including negligence, breach of contract regarding the purchase of a gun or certain damages from defects in the design of a gun.\n\nIn 2019, the Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit against gun manufacturer Remington Arms Co. to continue. The plaintiffs, a survivor and the families of nine other victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, wanted to hold the company – which manufactured the semi-automatic rifle that was used in the 2012 killing – partly responsible by targeting the company’s marketing practices, another area where gun manufacturers can be held liable. In 2022, those families reached a $73 million settlement with the company and its four insurers.\n\nThere are also more recent lawsuits against gun manufacturers. For example, the parents of some of the victims and survivors of the 2022 massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, have sued over the marketing practices of the company that made the gun used by the killer. Another suit, filed by the government of Buffalo, New York, in December over gun violence in the city, alleges that the actions of several gun manufacturers and distributors have endangered public health and safety. It is unclear how those lawsuits will fare in the courts.\n\n– Holmes Lybrand contributed to this item.\n\nThe NRA and lawsuits\n\nAt a campaign fundraiser in California on Tuesday, Biden said the National Rifle Association, the prominent gun rights advocacy organization, itself cannot be sued.\n\n“And the fact that the NRA has such overwhelming power – you know, the NRA is the only outfit in the nation that we cannot sue as an institution,” Biden said. “They got – they – before this – I became president, they passed legislation saying you can’t sue them. Imagine had that been the case with tobacco companies.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. While gun manufacturers have liability protections, no law was ever passed to forbid lawsuits against the NRA. The NRA has faced a variety of lawsuits in recent years.\n\nMachine guns\n\nAt the same Tuesday fundraiser in California, Biden said that he taught the Second Amendment in law school, “And guess what? It doesn’t say that you can own any weapon you want. It says there are certain weapons that you just can’t own.” One example Biden cited was this: “You can’t own a machine gun.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. The Second Amendment does not explicitly say people cannot own certain weapons – and the courts have not interpreted it to forbid machine guns. In fact, with some exceptions, people in more than two-thirds of states are allowed to own and buy fully automatic machine guns as long as those guns were legally registered and possessed prior to May 19, 1986, the day President Ronald Reagan signed a major gun law. There were more than 700,000 legally registered machine guns in the US as of May 2021, according to official federal data.\n\nFederal law imposes significant national restrictions on machine gun purchases, and the fact that there is a limited pool of pre-May 19, 1986 machine guns means that buying these guns tends to be expensive – regularly into the tens of thousands of dollars. But for Americans in most of the country, Biden’s claim that you simply “can’t” own a machine gun, period, is not true.\n\n“It’s not easy to obtain a fully automatic machine gun today, I don’t want to give that impression – but it is certainly legal. And it’s always been legal,” Gutowski said in March, when Biden previously made this claim about machine guns.\n\nCalifornia, where Biden made this remark on Tuesday, has strict laws restricting machine guns, but there is a legal process even there to apply for a state permit to possess one.\n\nThe ‘boyfriend loophole’\n\nIn the Friday speech to the National Safer Communities Summit, Biden said “we fought like hell to close the so-called boyfriend loophole” that had allowed people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence to buy and possess guns if the victim was not someone they were married to, living with or had a child with. Biden then said that now “we finally can say that those convicted of domestic violence abuse against their girlfriend or boyfriend cannot buy a firearm, period.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s categorical claim that such offenders now “cannot buy a firearm, period” is an exaggeration, though Biden did sign a law in 2022 that made significant progress in closing the “boyfriend loophole.” That 2022 law added “dating” partners to the list of misdemeanor domestic violence offenders who are generally prohibited from gun purchases – but in a concession demanded by Republicans, the law says these offenders can buy a gun five years after their first conviction or completion of their sentence, whichever comes later, if they do not reoffend in the interim.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the law’s new restriction on dating partners applies only to people who committed the domestic violence against a someone with whom they were in or “recently” had been in a “continuing” and “serious” romantic or intimate relationship. In other words, it omits people whose offense was against partners from their past or someone they dated casually.\n\nMarium Durrani, vice president of policy at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said there are “definitely some gaps” in the law, “so it’s not a blanket end-all be-all,” but she said it is “really a step in the right direction.”\n\nBiden’s endorsements from environmental organizations\n\nBiden said at a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Saturday: “Let me just say one thing very seriously. You know, I think this is the first time – and I’ve been around, as I said, a while – in history where, last week, every single environmental organization endorsed me.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that every single environmental organization had endorsed Biden. Four major environmental organizations did endorse him the week prior, the first time they had issued a joint endorsement, but other well-known environmental organizations have not yet endorsed in the presidential election.\n\nThe four groups that endorsed Biden together in mid-June were the Sierra Club, NextGen PAC, and the campaign arms of the League of Conservation Voters and the Natural Resources Defense Council. That is not a complete list of every single environmental group in the country. For example, Environmental Defense Fund, The Nature Conservancy, the National Audubon Society, Earthjustice and Greenpeace, in addition to some lesser-known groups, have not issued presidential endorsements to date.\n\nBiden’s claim of an endorsement from every environmental group comes amid frustration from some activists over his recent approvals of fossil fuel projects.\n\nThe population of Africa\n\nIn official speeches last Tuesday and last Wednesday and at a press conference the week prior, Biden claimed that Africa’s population would soon reach 1 billion. “You know, soon – soon, Africa will have 1 billion people,” he said last Wednesday.\n\nFacts First: This is false. Africa’s population exceeded 1 billion in 2009, according to United Nations figures; it is now more than 1.4 billion. Sub-Saharan Africa alone has a population of more than 1.1 billion.\n\nTexas and energy\n\nAt a campaign fundraiser in Connecticut on Friday, Biden spoke about reading recent news articles about the use of renewable energy sources in Texas. He said, “I think it’s 70% of all their energy produced by solar and wind because it is significantly cheaper. Cheaper. Cheaper.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s “70%” figure is not close to correct. The federal Energy Information Administration projected late last year that Texas would meet 37% of its electricity demand in 2023 with wind and solar power, up from 30% in 2022.\n\nTexas has indeed been a leader in renewable energy, particularly wind power, but the state is far from getting more than two-thirds of its energy from wind and solar alone. The organization that provides electricity to 90% of the state has a web page where you can see its current energy mix in real time; when we looked on Wednesday afternoon, during a heat wave, the mix included 15.8% solar, 10.2% wind and 6.6% nuclear, while 67.1% was natural gas or coal and lignite.\n\nBiden’s visits to Iraq and Afghanistan\n\nIn his Friday speech at the National Safer Communities Summit, Biden made a muddled claim about his past visits to Afghanistan and Iraq – saying that “you know, I spent a lot of time as president, and I spent 30-some times – visits – many more days in Afghanistan and Iraq.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim that he has visited Afghanistan and Iraq “30-some times” is false – the latest in a long-running series of exaggerations about his visits to the two countries. His presidential campaign said in 2019 that he made 21 visits to these countries, but he has since continued to put the figure in the 30s. And he has not visited either country “as president.”\n\nBiden’s travels with Xi Jinping\n\nAt another campaign fundraiser in California on Monday, Biden reprised a familiar claim about his travels with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who is, like him, a former vice president.\n\n“It wasn’t appropriate for Barack to be able to spend a lot of time getting to know him, so it was an assignment I was given. And I traveled 17,000 miles with him, usually one on one,” Biden said.\n\nFacts First: Biden’s “17,000 miles” claim remains false. Biden has not traveled anywhere close to 17,000 miles with Xi, though they have indeed spent lots of time together. This is one of Biden’s most common false claims as president, a figure he has repeated over and over in speeches despite numerous fact checks.\n\nWashington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler noted in 2021 that Biden and Xi often did not even travel parallel routes to their gatherings, let alone physically travel together. The only apparent way to get Biden’s mileage past 17,000, Kessler found, is to add the length of Biden’s flight journeys between Washington and Beijing, during which Xi was not with him.\n\nA White House official told CNN in early 2021 that Biden was adding up his “total travel back and forth” for meetings with Xi. But that is very different than traveling “with him” as Biden keeps saying, especially in the context of his boasts about how well he knows Xi. Biden has had more than enough time to make his language more precise.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Ghost guns Biden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/politics/biden-signs-gun-bill/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden signs bipartisan gun safety bill into law: ‘God willing, it’s ...', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious policy issues in Washington.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he finished signing the bill.\n\nThe legislation came together in the aftermath of recent mass shootings at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school and a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/sep/18/kevin-mccarthy/largest-share-of-foreign-payments-went-to-biden-as/', 'Headline': 'Largest share of foreign payments went to Biden associates, not kin ...', 'Snippet': 'By PolitFact’s count, about 89% of the money Biden family members received in payments — approximately $4.4 million — went to Hunter Biden or his businesses.

James Comer, R-Ky., chair of the House Oversight Committee, which has been investigating Biden family business dealings. The most recent memo, from Aug. 9, said the House Oversight Committee had ""identified over $20 million from foreign sources that benefitted the Biden family and their business associates.""\n\nPolitiFact analyzed this memo, along with two previously released memos.\n\nTogether, the convoluted, sometimes repetitive, maze of financial records largely supports McCarthy’s carefully phrased claim that ""$20 million in payments were directed to the Biden family members and associates."" But his word choice as he announced an impeachment inquiry into the president could give the impression that Biden family members, or even Joe Biden himself, received an equal share of the financial gains. That’s not what bank records PolitiFact has reviewed show.\n\nThe lion’s share of the $20 million went to Biden family business associates; about $5 million went to Biden family members. The records show no evidence that any payments went to Joe Biden, who was vice president when some of the payments occurred. The records also do not reveal that Joe Biden engaged in wrongdoing.\n\nMcCarthy did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.\n\nA tale of three memos: Majority of foreign payments went to Biden family ‘associates’\n\nFinancial records made public between March 16 and Aug. 9 show details of an intricate web of about $19.3 million in payments from foreign sources that were directed to the Bidens’ associates and at least three Biden family members.\n\nThe memos that detail these payments don’t provide evidence that Joe Biden took any official actions because of his family’s business dealings.\n\nThe memos show that about $14.4 million in payments were made to ""associates"" of the Biden family or accounts associated with those individuals. These payments went largely to Hunter Biden business partners: Devon Archer, James Gilliar, Vuk Jeremić and John Robinson Walker.\n\nOther Republicans have echoed this talking point, without McCarthy’s careful phrasing. On Sept. 17, former Vice President Mike Pence, who\'s running for the Republican presidential nomination, told Fox News that when Joe Biden was vice president, his ""family accepted some $20 million, which is a hard fact.""\n\nThese payments to associates originated from companies including Burisma, Bladon Enterprises, State Energy HK and, in one instance, from Yelena Baturina, a wealthy Russian whose name has also been spelled ""Elena.""\n\nBaturina wired $3.5 million to a bank account linked to Hunter Biden and Archer, according to the memos. Republicans alleged some of this money went directly to Hunter Biden, but Archer testified the money was for an unrelated real estate transaction and did not go directly to Hunter Biden. Given this information, we counted it as a payment to an associate; we will update if more evidence comes to light.\n\nDevon Archer, Hunter Biden\'s former business partner, arrives on Capitol Hill July 31, 2023, to give closed-door testimony to the House Oversight Committee. (AP)\n\nAbout $5 million in payments went to Biden family members\n\nFrom 2014 to 2020, Biden family members received about $4.94 million from sources with ties to Ukraine, Romania, China and Kazakhstan. The memos show these payments went to:\n\nHunter Biden, the president’s son;\n\nJames Biden, the president’s brother;\n\nHallie Biden, the wife of Joe Biden’s late son Beau, who also had a relationship with Hunter after Beau’s passing;\n\nAnd an unknown account the memo characterized as a ""Biden"" account without explanation.\n\nIn many instances, payments to Biden family members were sent by wire to Robinson Walker LLC, a company owned by an associate of Hunter Biden, before they were sent to Biden family accounts.\n\nBy PolitFact’s count, about 89% of the money Biden family members received in payments — approximately $4.4 million — went to Hunter Biden or his businesses.\n\nOf the $4.4 million, Hunter Biden and companies he was linked to received:\n\n$2.6 million for his work on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nAbout $949,000 that originated from Bladon Enterprises, a company linked to Gabriel Popoviciu, according to the memos. Popoviciu is a Romanian businessman who was convicted in Romania on criminal corruption charges.\n\n$700,000 that originated from State Energy HK Ltd. and CEFC Infrastructure, two Chinese companies.\n\nAnd $142,300 that came from Kazakhstani millionaire Kenes Rakishev\'s Singapore-based company, and was used to buy Hunter Biden a sports car.\n\nA company linked to James Biden received more than $350,000 that originated with State Energy HK. Hallie Biden received two payments totaling $35,000, which the memos said originated from State Energy HK and Bladon Enterprises.\n\nSeveral payments totaling $150,000 went to the unspecified ""Biden"" account. The memos said that money originated with State Energy HK and Bladon Enterprises.\n\nFor more than four years, Republicans have been investigating the Biden family’s financial links to foreign nationals and foreign governments. Shortly after learning they had won a narrow majority in the House in the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee announced that investigating the president and his family’s business deals would be a top priority.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Ian Sams said on X, formerly Twitter, that Republicans have ""turned up no evidence of wrongdoing"" after investigating President Biden for nine months.\n\nHunter Biden remains under federal investigation for his taxes. On Sept. 14, he was indicted on one count of possession of a firearm he obtained after lying about his drug use and two counts of making false statements about his illegal drug use on a form when buying the gun.\n\nHunter Biden speaks to guests during the White House Easter Egg Roll on April 18, 2022, in Washington. (AP)\n\nWhat is a shell company?\n\nMcCarthy described the payments to Biden associates and family members as having flowed through ""shell companies.""\n\nA shell company is ""a corporate entity set-up that generally has no business operations,"" said David P. Weber, a professor in the accounting and legal studies department at Salisbury University\'s Perdue School of Business. Weber previously served as chief investigator for the Securities and Exchange Commission and as special counsel for enforcement with the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nGenerally speaking, Weber said, ""shell companies are entities formed in a jurisdiction that requires minimal documentation over who the beneficial owner is, have no active business operations or employees, and are formed for secrecy or privacy purposes.""\n\nIn the popular understanding, shell companies usually have a negative connotation, often for good reasons, experts say.\n\nSometimes, shell companies can be created for legitimate purposes, experts said. For instance, they can keep income streams separate if they are to be taxed or regulated in separate jurisdictions, said Daniel Shaviro, a taxation professor at New York University Law School. Weber said he’s seen examples in which gay couples have used shell companies to hide the joint ownership of homes in countries where LGBTQ+ couples are persecuted.\n\nMore often, though, a true ""shell company"" is a red flag for financial investigators, experts said.\n\n""Most shell companies are formed for illegitimate purposes, such as tax evasion, money laundering, other illegal activities,"" Weber said.\n\nIt’s not clear whether companies in the Hunter Biden case qualify as shell companies.\n\nIn analyzing the 21 companies cited in a GOP memo that were founded by, in partnership with, or linked to Hunter Biden, the Washington Post Fact Checker concluded that ""virtually all of the companies (many of which now are defunct) had legitimate business interests. Others had clearly identified business investments.""\n\nFor instance, the Fact Checker found entities such as separate companies founded by Hunter Biden that handled legal and lobbying work, the latter of which was disclosed as required under federal law. Rosemont Seneca Partners and several offshoots were vehicles for investments Biden and his associates made in technology, energy and entertainment ventures.\n\nA Republican memo described the Center for International Relations and Sustainable Development — a Biden family associate’s account, which received $3 million from the Chinese company State Energy HK — as ""a public policy think tank registered in Belgrade and New York.""\n\nTwo entities, Hudson West III and Hudson West IV, had an energy investment deal with CEFC China Energy. Comer has criticized this effort as ""a scheme to try to get China to buy liquefied natural gas,"" which could be viewed as a tacit acknowledgement that the companies were engaged in actual business pursuits rather than serving as shell companies.\n\n""A company that has legitimate business interests or operations is not generally considered a shell company,"" Weber said. ""It would be considered a real, operating business. Active, operating businesses with employees, physical location, or business interests"" would generally not ""fall into the definition of a shell company.""\n\nThis explains the term’s potency: It includes a clear suggestion of shadiness. But Shaviro said that if the companies do have legitimate business interests and investments, then the Republicans’ use of the term ""shell companies"" is ""inaccurate"" and ""contrary to its generally accepted meaning.""\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcCarthy said ""bank records show that nearly $20 million in payments were directed to the Biden family members and associates through various shell companies.""\n\nFinancial records released by House Republicans show a little less than $20 million in payments, but $14 million went to associates, while $5 million went to Biden family members, including Hunter.\n\nHowever, McCarthy was citing the $20 million in payments in support of an impeachment inquiry of Joe Biden, and the bank records contain neither evidence that foreign payments went to Joe Biden himself, nor evidence of wrongdoing by the president.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s not clear that the phrase ""shell companies,"" which connotes illegitimate purposes, accurately describes the corporate entities through which the money flowed. Many of the companies in question appear to have had tangible business and investment purposes, which would not fit the commonly used definition of shell companies.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides ...', 'Full_text': 'In a prime-time speech to the nation, President Joe Biden spoke about gun violence and his proposals to reduce it. Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/09/02/1120690193/bidens-speech-walks-a-fine-line-in-its-attack-on-maga-republicans', 'Headline': ""Biden's speech walks a fine line in attack on MAGA Republicans - NPR"", 'Snippet': 'President Biden delivers a prime-time speech Thursday night at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia. Democrats have picked up some momentum this election cycle with wins in ...', 'Full_text': 'Democrats have picked up some momentum this election cycle with wins in multiple special elections, following the Supreme Court\'s overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nAnd the FBI search of former President Trump\'s Florida home has thrust Trump back into the spotlight, front and center. Lots of his candidates have won contentious primaries; he\'s consolidated his base; and his renewed presence has threatened to make the November elections a choice rather than a referendum on President Biden.\n\nBiden and the White House leaned into that Thursday night with an unusual prime-time address that broke no news or made any big announcements. Instead, Biden took the opportunity to elevate Trump and make it a choice between what Biden and Democrats stand for and MAGA Republican extremism, as he sees it, and its rising influence in positions of power throughout the country.\n\n""I believe America is at an inflection point,"" the president said in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, the same city where he launched his 2020 presidential campaign, ""one of those moments that determine the shape of everything that\'s to come after. And now America must choose to move forward or to move backwards.""\n\nOn the eve of Labor Day weekend, the traditional pivot to the final sprint of general elections across the country, here are three takeaways from Biden\'s speech:\n\n1. Biden tried to reinforce the idea that this election is a choice, not a referendum... on him\n\nElections, especially midterm elections, are traditionally a check on the president. Inflation is high, Biden is unpopular and people are pessimistic about the direction of the country. That usually would mean a wipeout in a president\'s first midterm.\n\nSo this gave Biden an opportunity to deflect from that — and lay out a choice.\n\n""MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,"" Biden said, ""backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.""\n\nHe highlighted threats to democracy as being urgent and instigated by Trump. Biden doesn\'t often use Trump\'s name, but he name-checked him three times in this speech. And when you do that, it\'s going to look and sound political. And that was obviously intentional.\n\nWith Trump back in the news, it offered Biden a way to elevate him, hold him up as the standard-bearer of the GOP, what it stands for, and draw a line in the sand.\n\n""It\'s pretty clear they want to amplify the MAGA message,"" said Democratic strategist Joel Payne. ""Almost feels like a pre-argument against what a Republican House might be pushing for the next two years, setting up a broader narrative about how he is fighting to stop Republicans from anti-democratic moves.""\n\n2. This may have been a political speech, but that doesn\'t mean there aren\'t real threats\n\nYou\'d be forgiven if you confused Biden\'s address for a convention speech, because that\'s where you draw contrasts with your opponent and lay out a vision for the country.\n\nBut that\'s not to say there aren\'t real or urgent threats. Election deniers are closer to controlling elections in key places, and as we\'ve said many times watching the Jan. 6 hearings, the institutions of democracy may have held in 2020, but only because of the people who were running them.\n\nNow many of those structures are run by people who support Trump and his election lies all the way.\n\nWe\'ve seen political violence, the FBI is facing threats, as are poll workers and local election officials. There is no doubt that conspiratorial elements of Trumpism are more potentially operational now than they were before the 2020 presidential election.\n\n""Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election — either they win or they were cheated,"" Biden said.\n\nAnd with the election two months away, the White House would argue highlighting that threat is key.\n\n3. There is a degree of risk in Biden\'s strategy\n\nDemocrats\' recent momentum in multiple special elections has largely been due to abortion rights, not necessarily about threats to democracy.\n\nYes, a recent NBC poll showed threats to democracy rising to the No. 1 issue, and that is significant, as it overtook cost of living, which was second. But it was only with 21% of respondents. Economic-related items when combined — cost of living and jobs and the economy — were 30%, higher than threats to democracy.\n\nWhat\'s more, when you break down those who said threats to democracy were their top issue, 53% were Democrats, while 32% of Republicans and 11% of independents did. And Democrats and Republicans certainly view the ""threats to democracy"" very differently. Democrats obviously see Trump and ""MAGA extremism"" as the threat, while many Republicans, who have believed Trump\'s election lies, believe Democrats and (not) rigged elections are the problems.\n\nSo the White House might be overreading polls here.\n\nRepublicans, many of whom are now aligned with Trump, are incensed.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy gave a speech before Biden spoke and said the president needed to apologize for what he saw as insulting the millions of Americans who voted for Trump.\n\nIt certainly shows the 180-degree shift McCarthy has made since after Jan. 6 in his quest to become House speaker. But it also highlights the high bar Biden has in trying to make clear he is talking about Republican elected officials and not voters.\n\n""Not even a majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans,"" Biden said. ""Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know because I\'ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans. But there\'s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.""\n\nThat is a very fine line for a president, who isn\'t always artful with his words, to walk and stick to. The GOP will obviously use this to fire up their base against Democrats and Biden in these midterms, but the White House is gambling that conservatives who dislike him are already fired up — and Democrats need to keep their base engaged.\n\n""There is a risk of overreaching on this,"" Payne said, ""especially at a point when Republicans are on their heels trying to protect some anticipated gains in the \'22 midterms.""\n\nBut, he added, ""I think it also helps juice the base [with] moral clarity on saving the democracy.""'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://newrepublic.com/article/175610/second-amendment-protect-hunter-biden-too', 'Headline': 'Hunter Biden’s Best Allies Could Be the Supreme Court’s Conservatives', 'Snippet': 'Hunter Biden’s Best Allies Could Be the Supreme Court’s Conservatives The court’s right-wing bloc has lately applied a “history-and-tradition” test to Second Amendment cases—and it ...', 'Full_text': 'Last year, the Supreme Court made it harder for Congress and state legislatures to pass laws that restrict when Americans can own and carry guns. It instituted a new history-and-tradition test in New York Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen that lower courts have already used to overturn various gun control laws. President Joe Biden is among Bruen’s critics, having said he was “deeply disappointed” by the court’s ruling last summer.\n\n“Since 1911, the State of New York has required individuals who would like to carry a concealed weapon in public to show a need to do so for the purpose of self-defense and to acquire a license,” Biden said then. “More than a century later, the United States Supreme Court has chosen to strike down New York’s long-established authority to protect its citizens. This ruling contradicts both common sense and the Constitution, and should deeply trouble us all.”\n\nThe president may now have at least some reason to think the ruling is less troubling: It could ultimately save his son from federal prosecutors. On Thursday, the Justice Department charged Hunter Biden with three counts of violating federal gun laws. According to the indictment, Hunter faces one count of illegal possession of a firearm while under the influence of an illegal drug and two counts of making false statements about his drug use when purchasing the firearm in question in 2018.\n\nBruen focused on New York’s regime for issuing concealed-carry licenses, which had been criticized for its selective application and its discriminatory effects. It was the first major Second Amendment case the high court heard in more than a decade. In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, the justices held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms. McDonald v. Chicago, a follow-up case decided in 2010, applied Heller’s reasoning to state and local governments as well.\n\nIn the 12 years that followed, lower courts continued to uphold nearly all gun regulations that faced legal challenges from gun owners and Second Amendment groups. Bruen changed that dynamic by imposing a stricter test for lower courts to use when deciding whether particular gun laws pass constitutional muster. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, laid out a history-and-tradition test that reflected the conservative majority’s commitment to originalism.\n\n“When the Second Amendment’s plain text covers an individual’s conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct,” Thomas wrote. “The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual’s conduct falls outside the Second Amendment’s unqualified command.”\n\nLower courts have since used this test to strike down a variety of long-standing gun laws. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments later this fall in United States v. Rahimi, where the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals used Bruen to strike down a federal law that prohibits gun ownership by people under domestic violence restraining orders. The Fifth Circuit panel noted that there was no evidence that early American legislatures passed similar laws, meaning that it did not meet the history-and-tradition standard. That American society did not recognize domestic violence as a major societal issue until after women obtained the legal and civil rights they often lacked in the founding era did not matter.\n\nHunter’s case revolves around a provision known as Section 922(g)(3), which makes it illegal for someone to own a firearm if they are an “unlawful user” of a controlled substance. This ban applies even if the person is not under the influence when they actually buy, carry, or use a gun. Since American legislatures did not criminalize drug use until the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, there is good reason to believe 922(g)(3) is no longer constitutional in a post-Bruen world. Indeed, at least one federal court has already reached that exact conclusion.\n\nIn August, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in United States v. Daniels that a 922(g)(3) conviction had failed Bruen’s history-and-tradition test and therefore violated the Second Amendment. The government had convicted Patrick Daniels, the defendant in that case, for violating the provision based on his admission that he used marijuana from time to time each month. But prosecutors did not show that he was under the influence of marijuana or any other controlled substance when he was arrested or even when he had last used them.\n\nJudge Jerry Smith, writing for the unanimous three-judge panel, concluded that federal prosecutors had not provided sufficient historical evidence to justify upholding 922(g)(3). He acknowledged that an exact founding-era analogue was unlikely because the founding generation had a different relationship with marijuana than modern Americans. (Hemp was often used to make rope in the early nineteenth century, and, Smith noted, George Washington cultivated it at Mount Vernon.) But states also did not enact gun restrictions similar to 922(g)(3) for other addictive or intoxicating substances like alcohol, which was seen as a much greater vice in that era.\n\n“Throughout American history, laws have regulated the combination of guns and intoxicating substances,” Smith wrote. “But at no point in the 18th or 19th century did the government disarm individuals who used drugs or alcohol at one time from possessing guns at another. A few states banned carrying a weapon while actively under the influence, but those statutes did not emerge until well after the Civil War. Section 922(g)(3)—the first federal law of its kind—was not enacted until 1968, nearly two centuries after the Second Amendment was adopted.”\n\nThe panel’s ruling was ultimately narrow, Smith concluded. “We do not invalidate the statute in all its applications, but, importantly, only as applied to Daniels,” he wrote. “Nor do we suggest that a robust Second Amendment is incompatible with other reasonable gun regulations.” But the ruling also rested on a fairly rigid interpretation of Bruen’s test. By rejecting on various grounds the alcohol-related analogues the government offered, it all but guaranteed that no such historical tradition would be found.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit is neither the first nor the last court to address this question. Federal district courts in Oklahoma and Texas have reached separate but similar conclusions about 922(g)(3)’s constitutionality over the past year, while some federal courts in other jurisdictions have upheld the provision since Bruen. Last month, for example, a federal judge in Iowa explicitly declined to adopt the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation itself.\n\n“This narrow reading and demand for near perfect analogues—despite acknowledging Bruen’s pronouncement analogues need not be perfect—is too severe,” Judge C.J. Williams wrote in a ruling on a pretrial motion, referring to the Fifth Circuit’s ruling, “and places too great an emphasis on the specific controlled substance Daniels used—marijuana—when Section 922(g)(3) regulates unlawful users and addicts of any controlled substance, not specific controlled substances.”\n\nWhat happens next is not clear. Another federal appeals court upholding the provision as constitutional could prompt the Supreme Court to intervene to resolve the circuit split. The various lower court rulings may also be affected by the high court’s decision in Rahimi in the upcoming term, especially if the justices refine or alter the history-and-tradition test for Second Amendment cases. And while Hunter’s lawyers may opt to challenge this case on constitutional grounds, they have already argued against its lawfulness for other reasons that may succeed without reaching this precise constitutional question.\n\nFor now, the only thing that is certain is that the Justice Department filed charges against the president’s son under a gun control statute of questionable constitutionality in the middle of a post-Bruen revolution in Second Amendment case law. Joe Biden’s critics often accuse him of waging a war on law-abiding Americans’ right to bear arms. If you had told those critics one year ago who the most prominent target of this war would be, they probably wouldn’t have believed you.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/03/28/1166577083/biden-guns-congress', 'Headline': 'Biden pushes for assault ban, but GOP leaders remain opposed : NPR', 'Snippet': 'Biden pushes for assault ban, ...

When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197824584/the-biden-administration-proposes-new-federal-standards-for-nursing-home-care', 'Headline': 'Biden New Federal Standards for Nursing Home Care : NPR', 'Snippet': ""NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, after the Biden Administration proposed a new national standard for staffing nursing homes."", 'Full_text': 'In his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden made a promise to ""protect seniors\' lives."" And he\'s following through on that promise with his latest push to ensure that nursing homes, serving 1.2 million seniors, are sufficiently staffed around the clock.\n\nOn Sept. 1, the Biden administration issued a proposal to establish comprehensive staffing requirements for nursing homes across the country. The President, alongside the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has proposed a minimum nursing staff standard for facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, more than 200,000 residents and staff in long-term care facilities have died because of COVID-19.\n\n""That\'s unacceptable,"" Xavier Becerra, the secretary of HHS, told Morning Edition.\n\nRoughly three quarters of long-term care facilities would have to hire additional staff to meet the administration\'s requirements, CMS estimates.\n\n""It\'s a big change in the sense that the industry hasn\'t had to follow particular standards,"" Becerra said. ""And it\'s been the wild, wild west when it comes to quality and accountability at nursing homes throughout the country. What we\'re simply saying is we don\'t want [the] wild, wild west when we send our loved ones.""\n\nNursing is inevitably a demanding job, and it has been widely regarded as one of the most stressful occupations, according to the journal Acta Biomedica. The profession is associated with high levels of staff turnover, absenteeism and levels of burnout.\n\nIn an attempt to improve nurse retention rates and attract more people to the industry, CMS would work with private sector partners, investing over $75 million in financial incentives, such as tuition reimbursement.\n\nJacob Conrad edited the digital version.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/01/1197074873/nursing-homes-staff-ratio-biden-medicare-medicaid', 'Headline': ""Nursing home staffing requirements could fizzle, despite Biden's ... - NPR"", 'Snippet': ""Understaffed nursing homes are a huge problem, and Biden's promised fix 'sabotaged' Updated September 1, 2023 12:54 PM ET Originally published September 1, 2023 5:00 AM ET.

The proposed rule would require each resident get 33 minutes of care a day from a registered nurse. It also would mandate that at least one RN be working at a facility 24 hours a day. For nurse\'s aides, the care hours recommended are 2.45 hours per resident per day, a total below what was studied in the research referenced in this story. The comment period for the proposed rule goes until Nov. 6.\n\nThe Biden administration last year promised to establish minimum staffing levels for the nation\'s roughly 15,000 nursing homes. It was the centerpiece of an agenda to overhaul an industry the government said was rife with substandard care and failures to follow federal quality rules.\n\nBut a research study the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services commissioned to identify the appropriate level of staffing made no specific recommendations and analyzed only staffing levels lower than what the previous major federal evaluation had considered best, according to a copy of the study reviewed this week by KFF Health News. Instead, the new study said there was no single staffing level that would guarantee quality care, although the report estimated that higher staffing levels would lead to fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits, faster care, and fewer failures to provide care.\n\nPatient advocates said the report was the latest sign that the administration would fall short of its pledge to establish robust staffing levels to protect the 1.2 million Americans in skilled nursing facilities.\n\nResidents at risk\n\nAlready, the administration is six months behind its self-imposed deadline of February to propose new rules. Those proposals, which have not been released, were under evaluation from May until this week by the Office of Management and Budget. The study, dated June 2023, has not been formally released either, but a copy was posted on the CMS website. It was taken down shortly after KFF Health News published this article.\n\n""It\'s honestly heartbreaking,"" said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for nursing home patients in New York state. ""I just don\'t see how this doesn\'t ultimately put more residents at risk of neglect and abuse. Putting the government\'s imprimatur on a standard that is patently unsafe is going to make it much more difficult for surveyors to hold facilities accountable for the harm caused by understaffing nursing homes.""\n\nFor months, the nursing home industry has been lobbying strenuously against a uniform ratio of patients to nurses and aides. ""What is clear as you look across the country is every nursing home is unique and a one-size-fits-all approach does not work,"" said Holly Harmon, senior vice president of quality, regulatory, and clinical services at the American Health Care Association, an industry trade group.\n\nGrueling work, low pay\n\nNursing home groups have emphasized the widespread difficulty in finding workers willing to fill existing certified nursing assistant jobs, which are often grueling and pay less than what workers can make at retail stores. Homes say their licensed nurses are often drawn away by other jobs, such as better-paying hospital positions. ""The workforce challenges are real,"" said Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of LeadingAge, an association that represents nonprofit nursing homes.\n\nThe industry has also argued that if the government wants it to hire more workers it needs to increase the payments it makes through state Medicaid programs, which are the largest payor for nursing home care. Advocates and some researchers have argued that nursing homes, particularly for-profit ones, can afford to pay employees more and hire additional staff if they forsake some of the profits they give investors.\n\n""Certainly, facilities haven\'t put all the dollars back into direct care over the years,"" said David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. ""But for certain facilities, it\'s going to be a big lift to pay for"" higher staffing levels, he said in an interview last week.\n\nWidely anticipated study\n\nIn a written statement to KFF Health News, Jonathan Blum, CMS\' principal deputy administrator and chief operating officer, said the study had been posted in error.\n\n""CMS is committed to holding nursing homes accountable for protecting the health and safety of all residents, and adequate staffing is critical to this effort,"" he said. ""CMS\'s proposal is being developed using a rigorous process that draws on a wide range of source information, including extensive input from residents and their families, workers, administrators, experts, and other stakeholders. Our focus is on advancing implementable solutions that promote safe, quality care for residents.""\n\nBlum\'s statement called the study a ""draft,"" although nothing in the 478-page study indicated it was preliminary.\n\nThe study has been widely anticipated, both because of the central role the administration said it would play in its policy and because the last major CMS study, conducted in 2001, had concluded that nursing home care improves as staffing increases up to the level of about one worker for every six residents. The formal metric for that staffing level was 4.1 staff hours per resident per day, which is calculated by dividing the number of total hours worked by nurses and aides on duty daily by the number of residents present each day.\n\nCMS never adopted that staffing ratio and instead gave each nursing home discretion to determine a reasonable staffing level. Regulators rarely cite nursing homes for insufficient staffing, even though independent researchers have concluded low staffing is the root of many nursing home injuries. Too few nurse aides, for instance, often means immobile residents are not repositioned in bed, causing bedsores that can lead to infection. Low staffing also is often responsible for indignities residents face, such as being left in soiled bedsheets for hours.\n\n\'Sabotaged\'\n\nThe new research was conducted by Abt Associates, a regular contractor for CMS that also performed the 2001 study. But the report, in an implicit disagreement with its predecessor, concluded there was ""no obvious plateau at which quality and safety are maximized or \'cliff\' below which quality and safety steeply decline."" Abt referred questions about the study to CMS.\n\nThe study evaluated four minimum staffing levels, all of which were below the 4.1 daily staff hours that the prior study had identified as ideal. The highest was 3.88 daily staff hours. At that level, the study estimated 0.6% of residents would get delayed care and 0.002% would not get needed care. It also said that staffing level would result in 12,100 fewer hospitalizations of Medicare residents and 14,800 fewer emergency room visits. The report said three-quarters of nursing homes would need to add staff to meet that level and that it would cost $5.3 billion extra each year.\n\nThe lowest staffing level the report analyzed was 3.3 daily staffing hours. At that level, the report said, 3.3% of residents would get delayed care and 0.04% would not get needed care. That level would reduce hospitalizations of Medicare residents by 5,800 and lead to 4,500 fewer emergency room visits. More than half of nursing homes would have to increase staff levels to meet that ratio, the report said, and it would cost $1.5 billion more each year.\n\nCharlene Harrington, a professor emeritus of nursing at the University of California-San Francisco, said CMS ""sabotaged"" the push for sufficiently high staffing through the instructions it gave its contractor. ""Every threshold they looked at was below 4.1,"" she said. ""How can that possibly be a decent study? It\'s just unacceptable.""'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/28/fact-sheet-protecting-seniors-and-people-with-disabilities-by-improving-safety-and-quality-of-care-in-the-nations-nursing-homes/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Protecting Seniors by Improving Safety and Quality of Care ...', 'Snippet': 'To protect residents and crack down on unsafe nursing homes, President Biden will call on Congress to provide almost $500 million to CMS, a nearly 25% increase, to support health and safety ...', 'Full_text': ""All people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and to have access to quality medical care. The President is committed to ensuring that all Americans, including older Americans and people with disabilities, live in a society that is accessible, inclusive, and equitable. To accomplish that goal, the Administration continues to be committed to home- and community-based services and ensuring that in no case should a health care facility be causing a patient harm. The President believes we must improve the quality of our nursing homes so that seniors, people with disabilities, and others living in nursing homes get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve. That’s why he is announcing a set of reforms—developed by and implemented through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—that will improve the safety and quality of nursing home care, hold nursing homes accountable for the care they provide, and make the quality of care and facility ownership more transparent so that potential residents and their loved ones can make informed decisions about care.\n\nTo do this, the reforms the President is announcing will ensure that:\n\nevery nursing home provides a sufficient number of staff who are adequately trained to provide high-quality care;\n\npoorly performing nursing homes are held accountable for improper and unsafe care and immediately improve their services or are cut off from taxpayer dollars; and\n\nthe public has better information about nursing home conditions so that they can find the best available options.\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted the tragic impact of substandard conditions at nursing homes, which are home to many of our most at-risk community members. More than 1.4 million people live in over 15,500 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes across the nation. In the past two years, more than 200,000 residents and staff in nursing homes have died from COVID-19—nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nDespite the tens of billions of federal taxpayer dollars flowing to nursing homes each year, too many continue to provide poor, sub-standard care that leads to avoidable resident harm. In fact, failure to comply with Federal guidelines at nursing homes is widespread. The Government Accountability Office found that, from 2013 to 2017, 82% of all inspected nursing homes had an infection prevention and control deficiency, including a lack of regular handwashing, that was identified through Medicare and Medicaid surveys.\n\nWithout decisive action now, these unacceptable conditions may get worse. Private equity firms have been buying up struggling nursing homes, and research shows that private equity-owned nursing homes tend to have significantly worse outcomes for residents. Private equity firms’ investment in nursing homes has ballooned from $5 billion in 2000 to more than $100 billion in 2018, with about 5% of all nursing homes now owned by private equity firms. Too often, the private equity model has put profits before people—a particularly dangerous model when it comes to the health and safety of vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities. Recent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes:\n\nA recent study found that residents in nursing homes acquired by private equity were 11.1% more likely to have a preventable emergency department visit and 8.7% more likely to experience a preventable hospitalization, when compared to residents of for-profit nursing homes not associated with private equity.\n\nOne working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities over a seventeen-year period found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. That suggests an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nAnother study found that private equity-backed nursing homes’ COVID-19 infection rate and death rate were 30% and 40% above statewide averages, respectively.\n\nResearch also suggests that, despite depriving residents of quality care, private equity-owned nursing homes actually led to an uptick in Medicare costs, too.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new steps by Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) through its Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to improve the quality and safety of nursing homes, to protect vulnerable residents and the health care heroes who care for them, and to crack down on bad actors. The Administration is committed to these urgent actions as first steps toward fulfilling a broader commitment to ensure taxpayer dollars go toward the safe, adequate, and respectful care seniors and people with disabilities deserve—not to the pockets of predatory owners and operators who seek to maximize their profits at the expense of vulnerable residents’ health and safety.\n\nEnsuring Taxpayer Dollars Support Nursing Homes That Provide Safe, Adequate, and Dignified Care\n\nCMS is launching four new initiatives to ensure that residents get the quality care they need—and that taxpayers pay for. These initiatives will help ensure adequate staffing, dignity and safety in their accommodations, and quality care.\n\nEstablish a Minimum Nursing Home Staffing Requirement. The adequacy of a nursing home’s staffing is the measure most closely linked to the quality of care residents receive. For example, a recent study of one state’s nursing facilities found that increasing registered nurse staffing by just 20 minutes per resident day was associated with 22% fewer confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-19 deaths. CMS intends to propose minimum standards for staffing adequacy that nursing homes must meet. CMS will conduct a new research study to determine the level and type of staffing needed to ensure safe and quality care and will issue proposed rules within one year. Establishing a minimum staffing level ensures that all nursing home residents are provided safe, quality care, and that workers have the support they need to provide high-quality care. Nursing homes will be held accountable if they fail to meet this standard.\n\nReduce Resident Room Crowding. Most nursing home residents prefer to have private rooms to protect their privacy and dignity, but shared rooms with one or more other residents remain the default option. These multi-occupancy rooms increase residents’ risk of contracting infectious diseases, including COVID-19. CMS will explore ways to accelerate phasing out rooms with three or more residents and to promote single-occupancy rooms.\n\nStrengthen the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Value-Based Purchasing (“VBP”) Program. The SNF-VBPprogram awards incentive funding to facilities based on quality performance. CMS has begun to measure and publish staff turnover and weekend staffing levels, metrics which closely align with the quality of care provided in a nursing home. CMS intends to propose new payment changes based on staffing adequacy, the resident experience, as well as how well facilities retain staff.\n\nReinforce Safeguards against Unnecessary Medications and Treatments. Thanks to CMS’ National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care in Nursing Homes, the nation has seen a dramatic decrease in the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes in recent years. However, inappropriate diagnoses and prescribing still occur at too many nursing homes. CMS will launch a new effort to identify problematic diagnoses and refocus efforts to continue to bring down the inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications.\n\nEnhancing Accountability and Oversight\n\nHolding nursing homes accountable for their performance requires a robust compliance program—a program that has adequate funding to perform inspections and that imposes meaningful penalties when deficiencies are found. Federal taxpayer dollars should not flow to nursing homes that are unsafe.\n\nAdequately Fund Inspection Activities. For over seven years, funding to conduct health and safety inspections has remained flat while the number of complaints about nursing homes has surged. To protect residents and crack down on unsafe nursing homes, President Biden will call on Congress to provide almost $500 million to CMS, a nearly 25% increase, to support health and safety inspections at nursing homes.\n\nBeef up Scrutiny on More of the Poorest Performers. CMS’s Special Focus Facility (SFF) program identifies the poorest-performing nursing homes in the country for increased scrutiny in an effort to immediately improve the care they deliver. The SFF program currently requires more frequent compliance surveys for program participants, which must pass two consecutive inspections to “graduate” from the program. The SFF program will be overhauled to more quickly improve care for the affected residents, including changes that will make its requirements tougher and more impactful. CMS will also make changes that allow the program to scrutinize more facilities, by moving facilities through the program more quickly. Facilities that fail to improve will face increasingly larger enforcement actions, including termination from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, when appropriate.\n\nExpand Financial Penalties and Other Enforcement Sanctions. CMS will expand the instances in which it takes enforcement actions against poor-performing facilities based on desk reviews of data submissions, which will be performed in addition to on-site inspections. In July 2021, CMS rescinded a Trump Administration change that lowered penalty amounts on bad actor nursing homes for harmful deficiencies by imposing only a one-time fine, instead of more aggressive per-day fines that charge for each day a facility is out of compliance. CMS will now explore making such per-day penalties the default penalty for non-compliance. CMS will also use data, predictive analytics, and other information processing tools to improve enforcement. President Biden is also calling on Congress to raise the dollar limit on per-instance financial penalties levied on poor-performing facilities, from $21,000 to $1,000,000.\n\nIncrease Accountability for Chain Owners of Substandard Facilities. President Biden is calling on Congress to give CMS new authority to require minimum corporate competency to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs, enabling CMS to prohibit an individual or entity from obtaining a Medicare or Medicaid provider agreement for a nursing home (new or existing) based on the Medicare compliance history of their other owned or operated facilities (previous or existing). He is further calling on Congress to expand CMS enforcement authority at the ownership level, enabling CMS to impose enforcement actions on the owners and operators of facilities even after they close a facility, as well as on owners or operators that provide persistent substandard and noncompliant care in some facilities, while still owning others.\n\nProvide Technical Assistance to Nursing Homes to Help them Improve. CMS currently contracts with Quality Improvement Organizations that help providers across the health care spectrum make meaningful quality of care improvements. CMS will ensure that improving nursing home care is a core mission for these organizations and will explore pathways to expand on-demand trainings and information sharing around best practices, while expanding individualized, evidence-based assistance related to issues exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nIncreasing Transparency\n\nFor too long, corporate owners and operators have not been held to account for poor nursing home performance. CMS will improve the public transparency of facility ownership and safeguard nursing home residents.\n\nCreate a Database of Nursing Home Owners and Operators. CMS will create a new database that will track and identify owners and operators across states to highlight previous problems with promoting resident health and safety. This registry will use information collected through provider enrollment and health and safety inspections to provide more information about prospective owners and operators to states. Giving the public a resource to better understand owners’ and operators’ previous violations will empower states to better protect the health and safety of residents.\n\nImprove Transparency of Facility Ownership and Finances. CMS will implement Affordable Care Act requirements regarding transparency in corporate ownership of nursing homes, including by collecting and publicly reporting more robust corporate ownership and operating data. It will also make this information easier to find on the Nursing Home Care Compare website.\n\nEnhance Nursing Home Care Compare: CMS will implement a range of initiatives to improve Nursing Home Care Compare, the rating website designed to help families pick a facility for their loved ones. Under the Biden-Harris Administration’s leadership, CMS has already published new measures on Care Compare, which allow users to consider nursing home staff turnover, weekend staffing levels, and other important factors in their decision-making process. When the new minimum staffing requirement comes online, Care Compare will also prominently display whether a facility is meeting these minimum staffing requirements. CMS will further improve Care Compare by improving the readability and usability of the information displayed—giving you and your family insight into how to interpret key metrics. Finally, CMS will ensure that ratings more closely reflect data that is verifiable, rather than self-reported, and will hold nursing homes accountable for providing inaccurate information. The President is calling on Congress to give CMS additional authority to validate data and take enforcement action against facilities that submit incorrect information.\n\nExamine the Role of Private Equity. As described above, private equity investors are playing a growing role in the nursing home sector, and published research increasingly indicates that facility ownership by investment groups leads to worse outcomes while costing taxpayers more—particularly as these owners have sought to cut expenses at the cost of patient health and safety, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. HHS and other federal agencies will examine the role of private equity, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and other investment ownership in the nursing home sector and inform the public when corporate entities are not serving their residents’ best interests.\n\nCreating Pathways to Good-paying Jobs with the Free and Fair Choice to Join a Union\n\nEnsure Nurse Aide Training is Affordable. Lowering financial barriers to nurse aide training and certification will strengthen and diversify the nursing home workforce. CMSwill establish new requirements to ensure nurse aide trainees are notified about their potential entitlement to training reimbursement upon employment. CMS will further work with states to ensure reimbursement is being distributed and that free training opportunities are widely publicized.\n\nSupport State Efforts to Improve Staffing and Workforce Sustainability. Strengthening the nursing home workforce requires adequate compensation as well as a realistic career ladder. CMS will develop a template to assist and encourage States requesting to tie Medicaid payments to clinical staff wages and benefits, including additional pay for experience and specialization.\n\nLaunch National Nursing Career Pathways Campaign. CMS, in collaboration with the Department of Labor, will work with external entities—including training intermediaries, registered apprenticeship programs, labor-management training programs, and labor unions—to conduct a robust nationwide campaign to recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into long-term care careers, with pathways into health-care careers like registered and licensed nurses.\n\nEnsuring Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness in Nursing Homes\n\nContinued COVID-19 Testing in Long-term Care Facilities. Throughout the pandemic, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided approximately 3 million tests per week to all Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes and thousands more assisted living facilities, supporting outbreak testing and regular testing of staff. HHS will continue to support this key mitigation strategy for vulnerable residents and the staff that care for them.\n\nContinued COVID-19 Vaccinations and Boosters in Long-term Care Facilities. The Biden-Harris Administration has provided the full support of the federal government to states in ensuring that staff and residents across long-term care facilities have access to vaccinations and booster shots. Today, facilities are required to ensure staff are vaccinated and more than 87.1% of residents have received their primary series. CDC continues to offer all facilities the ability to be matched with a federal pharmacy partner to host an on-site vaccination clinic. CMS has reached out to thousands of these facilities directly to offer support, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has made a wide set of tools available. HHS will continue to promote access to these clinics and efforts to integrate vaccinations into routine services, incentivize vaccinations through provider quality payment programs, and continue to provide a full range of resources to continue to build confidence in the vaccine.\n\nStrengthen Requirements for On-site Infection Preventionists. CMS will clarify and increase the standards for nursing homes on the level of staffing facilities need for on-site infection prevention employees, undoing the Trump Administration’s changes to these requirements to help improve resident health and safety.\n\nEnhance Requirements for Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness. Both the pandemic and the increase in natural disasters have demonstrated how critical proactive emergency preparedness is to keeping residents of nursing homes safe. CMS is examining and considering changes to emergency preparedness requirements and is working to bolster the resiliency of the health care sector as part of an Administration-wide effort to be ready for the next pandemic and the next weather-related emergencies.\n\nIntegrate Pandemic Lessons into Nursing Home Requirements. The pandemic has underscored the need for resident-centered updates to nursing homes’ requirements of participation in Medicare and Medicaid. CMS will integrate new lessons on standards of care into nursing home requirements around fire safety, infection control, and other areas, using an equity lens.\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-steps-to-improve-quality-of-nursing-homes/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Announces New Steps to ...', 'Snippet': 'Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions to increase accountability of bad actors in the nursing home industry, improve the quality of nursing homes and make them safer.', 'Full_text': ""For far too long, nursing home residents have been victims of an industry with little accountability to keep American seniors safe and protected. COVID-19 has laid bare the challenges in America’s nursing homes, with over 200,000 residents and staff dying from COVID-19. That’s why in his State of the Union, President Biden launched an action plan to improve the safety and quality of care in the nation’s nursing homes. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions to increase accountability of bad actors in the nursing home industry, improve the quality of nursing homes and make them safer. These efforts complement the Administration’s investments in home and community-based services to prevent unnecessary nursing home admissions and help nursing home residents transition back home when possible.\n\nMore Aggressive Enforcement for the Worst-Performing Nursing Homes\n\nToday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced new actions to significantly strengthen accountability for nursing homes in the Special Focus Facilities (SFF) Program, an oversight program for the poorest performing nursing homes in the country. The SFF Program already provides more frequent inspections of these nursing homes, but more action is needed to ensure these nursing homes improve.\n\nThe SFF Program reforms announced for the first time today:\n\nIncrease penalties for nursing homes in the program that fail to improve: CMS will, effective immediately, begin using escalating penalties for violations, including considering facilities with citations for dangerous violations in two successive inspections for termination from Medicare and/or Medicaid funding.\n\nIncrease safety standards for improvement: Under today’s changes, CMS is increasing the requirements that nursing homes in the SFF Program must meet to be successful and graduate from the program. Even after a facility graduates from the program, CMS will now continue close scrutiny of the facility for at least 3 years—helping ensure these nursing homes consistently maintain compliance with safety requirements.\n\nIncrease technical assistance: CMS is also increasing its engagement with these poor-performing nursing homes, through direct and immediate outreach by CMS officials upon their selection as an SFF, to help them understand how to improve and to access support resources like CMS Quality Improvement Organizations.\n\nMore Resources to Support Good-Paying, Union Jobs in Nursing Home Care\n\nSufficient, high-quality staffing is the measure most closely linked to the quality-of-care residents receive. Creating good-paying, union jobs in the nursing home industry—and career pathways into those jobs—promotes the “double dignity” of both patients and workers. That’s why today the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the Department of Labor (“DOL”) are highlighting funds that are newly available to support pathways into good-quality nursing jobs—including for the nursing home workforce:\n\nA wide variety of workforce stakeholders can apply for $80 million in grant funding available right now: Now through January 6, nonprofit healthcare organizations, industry organizations or trade groups, labor unions, labor management organizations, education and training providers, workforce development entities, and Native American Tribal Governments can apply for the DOL’s Nursing Expansion Grant program, which will provide $80 million in grants to help address bottlenecks in training the U.S. nursing workforce and expand and diversify the pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. Specifically, these funds will help: 1) increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators, and 2) train frontline healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance along a career pathway and attain recognized postsecondary credentials, including Licensed Practical Nurses and Registered Nurses. This program will emphasize training those from historically marginalized and underrepresented populations, which helps to address the growing health equity gap in medically underserved communities.\n\nHHS is announcing $13 million in grants to expand nursing education and training: These funds made available through the Health Resources and Services Administration will help expand the number of nursing preceptors—experienced licensed clinicians who supervise nursing students during their clinical rotations. Expanding preceptors will help support the goal of nursing schools admitting more students by providing more opportunities for well-supported clinical rotations and, ultimately, career paths.\n\nHHS and DOL will provide opportunities to apply for additional federal funds to support the nursing workforce pipeline: HHS and DOL have identified hundreds of millions of dollars in funds coming online over the next year to help improve nurse staffing and workforce sustainability. The Biden-Harris Administration encourages eligible entities to braid these programs to attract and retain high-quality workers to serve in healthcare professions such as nursing aides, home health aides, and registered nurses:\n\nBy the end of this year, DOL’s Employment and Training Administration’s (ETA’s) YouthBuild will make available approximately $90 million in grant funding for eligible nonprofit organizations or consortia eligible to provide education or employment training under a Federal program, in order to provide job training and educational opportunities for at-risk youth, with over one-third of recent grantees offering healthcare-related training.\n\nOn a rolling basis, ETA’s National Dislocated Worker Grants program makes tens of millions or more in grant funding available to eligible States, outlying areas designated by the Governor, and organizations eligible for funding through the Native American Programs to develop training in entry-level nursing occupations such as Certified Nursing Assistant, Medical Assisting, and Physical Therapy. These funds help develop training after major economic dislocations, such as plant closures, mass layoffs, or higher-than-average demand for employment and training activities for dislocated members of the Armed Forces and their spouses—with approximately three-quarters of grantees connecting participants to careers in healthcare.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, ETA’s WORC Initiative Grants will make available up to $35 million in grants to eligible State Government, County Government, City or Township Government, Special District Government, Regional Organization, Independent School District, Public/State Controlled Institution of Higher Education, Private Institution of Higher Education, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Indian/Native American Tribal Governments. These grant funds enable impacted communities to develop local and regional workforce development solutions aligned with existing economic development strategies and community partnerships to promote new, sustainable job opportunities and long-term economic vitality, all to support dislocated workers, new entrants to the workforce, and incumbent workers for good jobs in high-demand occupations including behavioral health, dental health, and health IT.\n\nBuilding On Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s efforts build on the many other actions the Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to improve nursing home quality and accountability since President Biden announced the Nursing Home Reform Action Plan in the State of the Union:\n\nEstablishing minimum staffing requirements: CMS launched a public input process and research study that will inform future rulemaking on a minimum staffing requirement, and the proposed rule is on track for release by Spring 2023.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection: CMS is working with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to crack down on nursing homes that illegally hold families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nIncreasing transparency & accountability: CMS made available more data on who owns Medicare-certified nursing homes, helping empower families who are comparison shopping to understand whether a nursing home is part of a bad chain. CMS also released data publicly—for the first time—on mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, and changes of ownership for nursing homes and hospitals enrolled in Medicare.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding: CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for fiscal year (FY) 2023, including a nearly billion dollar payment increase and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program. CMS also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for nursing home residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention efforts—i.e., to tie Medicaid payments to measures of safety and quality of care.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop: CMS launched its enhanced Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System, integrating data on nursing homes’ weekend staffing rates for nurses and information on annual turnover among nurses and administrators. The updated Star Ratings increase transparency to make it easier for families to comparison shop to find the reliable, quality care their loved ones deserve.\n\nPreventing fraudsters from receiving Medicare funds: CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks to be eligible for Medicare funds, preventing abuse and Medicare fraud by nursing home owners.\n\nEnsuring pandemic preparedness: CMS updated its guidance to nursing home inspectors, including, among other things, requiring infection control specialists to be on site—not just off-site consultants as the prior Administration allowed.\n\n###\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/nursing-homes/info-2022/biden-nursing-home-reform.html', 'Headline': 'President Biden Proposes New Nursing Home Regulations - AARP', 'Snippet': 'Nursing homes have recorded nearly 1 million COVID cases among residents and more than a million cases among staffers in the past two years, according to \ufeffdata from the CMS, which regulates the facilities along with state survey agencies.Even for staffers with mild symptoms, a positive test usually means at least a few days away from work.', 'Full_text': 'The White House on Monday unveiled a slew of proposed changes to how U.S. nursing homes are regulated and run, including a vow to adopt federal minimum staffing requirements for facilities, step up enforcement of regulations and crack down on overcrowded rooms.\n\nPresident Joe Biden touched on the reforms during his State of the Union address on Tuesday , saying federal officials will “set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that they expect.""\n\nThe announcement comes as the pandemic has ravaged U.S. long-term care facilities, where 200,000 residents and workers have died from COVID-19. These facilities have been plagued by staffing shortages for years, but they’ve gotten much worse during the pandemic and threaten resident care and infection control.\n\n“Establishing a minimum staffing level ensures that all nursing home residents are provided safe, quality care and that workers have the support they need to provide high-quality care,” the White House said in a press release. “Nursing homes will be held accountable if they fail to meet this standard.”\n\nExactly what that standard looks like — or how facilities will be held accountable — are to be determined. Several aspects of Biden’s proposed nursing home reforms will need to clear public comment periods and other regulatory processes or require congressional action to take effect.\n\nBut resident advocates praised the announcement. “Not every issue gets mentioned in the State of the Union,” said Rhonda Richards, AARP’s senior legislative representative in government affairs. “It is significant that the president is talking about this. His plan will take important steps to better protect seniors in nursing homes and includes key policies that AARP has been advocating on.”\n\nChiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), told AARP in an interview that she has “personally met with nursing home residents, with CNAs — with certified nursing assistants — as well as the industry and ombudsmen to really hear what is happening on the ground.”\n\n“We have an ambitious agenda,” Brooks-LaSure says. “All of the things we’re doing are really focused on helping caregivers to be able to make better decisions if nursing home care is the right decision for their loved one.”\n\nAddressing staffing shortages\n\nNursing homes have recorded nearly 1 million COVID cases among residents and more than a million cases among staffers in the past two years, according to data from the CMS, which regulates the facilities along with state survey agencies. Even for staffers with mild symptoms, a positive test usually means at least a few days away from work. Huge numbers of certified nursing assistants, who generally make little more than minimum wage, have not received a COVID-19 booster shot.\n\n“Staffing is clearly the number one issue across the long-term care spectrum. It’s huge, not just for nursing homes but for all health care facilities,” says Mark Miller, Washington, D.C.’s long-term care ombudsman and the president of the National Association of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs. “That’s going to take a long time to build up, but that\'s the most significant piece to this.”\n\nWhile COVID deaths among residents have recently declined nationally as the omicron surge has waned, staffing shortages and cases among staff spiked in the four-week period ending Jan. 23, according to an AARP analysis of CMS data. Nearly 2 in 5 U.S. nursing homes reported a staffing shortage in that window.\n\nIn some states, the shortages were more dire. In Alaska, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming, more than 60 percent of facilities statewide reported a lack of staff.\n\nA growing body of research has connected short-staffed facilities with more severe COVID outbreaks, so residents are potentially at greater risk of infection when there aren’t enough nurses and other staff to go around.\n\nBut nursing home operators have long pushed back on mandatory staffing minimums, saying the real issue is that there aren’t enough interested and qualified workers to go around.\n\n“We would love to hire more nurses and nurse aides to support the increasing needs of our residents,” Mark Parkinson, president and CEO of the American Health Care Association, which represents more than 14,000 nursing homes and long-term care facilities, said in a statement. “However, we cannot meet additional staffing requirements when we can’t find people to fill the open positions, nor when we don’t have the resources to compete against other employers.”\n\nIncreasing fines, sanctions on ‘substandard facilities’\n\nThe White House proposal calls for increasing fines and penalties on facilities that fail to meet federal care standards, asking Congress to boost the limit on fines per infraction in some cases from $21,000 to $1 million.\n\nThe administration is also calling on Congress to significantly expand federal regulators’ ability to target bad actors — and to boost CMS funding by nearly 25 percent to $500 million annually for health and safety inspections of nursing homes. Under the White House proposal, regulators would be able to better track nursing home operators’ history of penalties and infractions.\n\n“When you get a Medicaid contract through CMS, they’re taken individually. It’s not like you’re looking at my past performance at other facilities that I owned,” says Miller, who also works with AARP’s Legal Counsel for the Elderly. “This is really going to shine a light on that.”\n\nAmong the White House’s other proposed nursing home reforms:\n\nA new CMS database that will make it easier to track and compare the performance of facilities owned by the same company or owner\n\nThe ability for CMS to go after owners for wrongdoing, even if an individual facility shuts down\n\nA phaseout of nursing home rooms with three or more residents in favor of single-occupancy rooms\n\nGreater oversight of residents’ diagnoses and prescriptions, with a focus on anti-psychotic drugs\n\nContinued funding and support for COVID-19 tests, vaccines and boosters in nursing homes\n\nMiller describes the White House’s plan as “the single most significant set of proposals I’ve seen in 35 years.” But he acknowledges that many of the proposals will require congressional action during a busy and contentious midterm election year. Some aspects of the proposal, like the staffing requirements, may be able to bypass Congress but will still take time to be implemented.\n\n\u200bAnd some critics argue that they don’t go far enough to address other issues like Medicaid reimbursement rates and worker compensation. “Our system of enforcement shouldn’t be based on punishment over improvement,” Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of the LeadingAge association of nonprofit aging services and nursing home providers, said in a statement.\n\nAndrew Soergel covers nursing homes and federal and state policy for AARP.

It's one of the most gut-wrenching moments American families face: when a loved one can no longer be cared for at home and needs to move into a nursing home."", 'Full_text': 'USA Today (Op-Ed): President Biden: Nursing homes are putting residents at risk. We\'re ending the abuse today.\n\n[President Joe Biden, 9/1/23]\n\nAs a country, we\'re delivering a clear message to the nursing home industry. If you tell families you\'ll take care of their loved ones, then follow through.\n\nIt\'s one of the most gut-wrenching moments American families face: when a loved one can no longer be cared for at home and needs to move into a nursing home. You lie awake at night wondering: will they receive the care and support they need? How can you be sure they\'ll be safe? Are you doing the right thing?\n\nUnfortunately, too many Americans across the country know firsthand how hard it can be to find a nursing home that provides that peace of mind. A woman in Texas, who has changed nursing facilities three times in four years over concerns about care, wrote to me, ""we keep looking for someplace that will fulfill the promises they make when you\'re admitted."" A daughter in New York, whose mother is in a facility, wrote ""it keeps me up at night, when there\'s half of what\'s needed"" to keep her mom safe.\n\nDespite nursing homes receiving nearly $100 billion annually from American taxpayers, too many facilities are understaffed, which can result in severe illness and even death for residents. Those vulnerabilities were exposed during the pandemic, when more than 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died from COVID-19. And in recent years, more private-equity firms have been buying up nursing homes and slashing key staff to cut costs and make bigger profits, endangering the safety of their residents in the process.\n\nIn my State of the Union address, I pledged to crack down on nursing homes that put the well-being of their residents at risk. Today, here\'s how my administration is following through on this commitment to ensure every nursing home is safe for every resident, and residents get the care they deserve.\n\nWe\'re proposing minimum staffing requirements for every taxpayer-funded nursing home. Under our new proposed standards, every nursing facility would have to provide a registered nurse on site 24/7 and have enough nurses and nurse aides to provide routine bedside care, among other tasks. Research shows that these staffing levels will save lives, provide residents with a higher quality of life and prevent needless suffering.\n\nThink of it this way: we are working to make sure no nursing home can sacrifice the safety of their residents just to add some dollars to their bottom line. It\'s telling that non-profit nursing homes are three times as likely as for-profit facilities to already satisfy the minimum staffing standard we\'re proposing today. Some corporate nursing home owners are taking taxpayer dollars while cutting corners on staffing so they can make big payouts to executives and shareholders. It\'s wrong.\n\nWe\'re also supporting the folks who are doing God\'s work – the nursing staff who care for so many of our loved ones, but who are over-worked and under-resourced. Nursing home staff describe getting burnt out when they have too many residents to care for in too little time. Many end up leaving the industry. Minimum staffing standards would help them stay in the jobs they love. And we\'re doing our part.\n\nToday, the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing a new $75 million investment, on top of hundreds of millions of dollars already committed, to recruit, train and retain nurses and other caregivers.\n\nThese announcements are the latest in my administration\'s effort to make nursing homes safer and to make sure taxpayer dollars are well spent. We\'ve increased transparency and accountability for nursing home owners, gone after fraud and abuse and more. We also remain focused on supporting high quality care at home. That\'s why in April, I signed an executive order to support caregivers, building on prior actions and investments in home and community-based care.\n\nAs a country, we\'re delivering a clear message to the nursing home industry: no more padding profits on the backs of residents and nurses. If you tell families you\'ll take care of their loved ones, then follow through.\n\nThat\'s how we build a long-term care system where loved ones can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive the care they need in the setting of their choice and where there is a pipeline of health care workers into good-paying jobs – that include the free and fair choice to join a union.\n\nFor all you facing that most gut-wrenching of moments, you and your loved ones deserve nothing less than peace of mind and dignity. I have your back.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/04/06/1088660155/nursing-home-minimum-staffing-labor-shortage-medicare-medicaid-nurses', 'Headline': 'Biden calls for minimum staffing requirement in nursing homes - NPR', 'Snippet': ""To address the problem of poor care, President Biden is calling for a federal minimum staffing requirement in nursing homes. The nursing home industry says there aren't workers to fill the jobs."", 'Full_text': 'A decade after suffering a stroke that forever changed his life, Maurice Miller has good days and bad ones.\n\nOn good days, the staff at his nursing home in Takoma Park, Md., can meet all of his basic needs: feeding him, cleaning him, changing his hospital gown, and ensuring that his laptop, which he uses through dictation, is charged and within reach.\n\nOn bad days, something goes wrong and it takes awhile before someone is available to respond to his call button — sometimes 45 minutes or longer.\n\n""It\'s a bad day when I\'m in pain, and I\'m not going to get relief in a timely fashion,"" says Miller, who describes himself as a functional quadriplegic.\n\nIt\'s also a bad day when he cannot call his 94-year-old mother, because his computer has been pushed out of reach. Or when his roommate is having a crisis of some sort and help does not come immediately. Or when he misses his wheelchair time because there aren\'t enough staff to lift him out of bed.\n\nThe bad days are more likely to be those when the facility is short-staffed. Lying in bed in his darkened room, Miller usually knows when there are fewer than five nursing assistants tending to the 50 or so residents on his hall. He hears about it from the staff, who apologize for the long waits and ask for patience.\n\nThe Biden administration is vowing to improve nursing home care by setting a minimum staffing requirement\n\nStories like Miller\'s — and far worse — have pushed the Biden administration to call for major reforms in nursing homes. Earlier this year, the White House outlined an ambitious plan to improve the safety and quality of nursing home care, first and foremost by establishing a federal minimum staffing requirement for nursing homes funded through Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n""We think it\'s really important to set a very specific standard that can be measured against, to really make sure staff is adequate to ensure quality,"" says Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that regulates and funds most nursing homes in the U.S.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that understaffing nursing homes can harm the health of residents, who suffer more bedsores, more weight loss, more overprescribing of anti-psychotic medications, and — during the pandemic — more COVID-19 cases and deaths.\n\nBrooks-LaSure says her agency will determine how much staff nursing homes should be required to have and then enforce that through a rule. She aims to have a rule in place within a year, an optimistic time frame given the lengthy federal rulemaking process and other challenges.\n\nThe nursing home industry calls minimum staffing requirements ""unrealistic""\n\nThe American Health Care Association, which represents 14,000 long-term care facilities, has called into question the administration\'s authority to enact such a rule without involving Congress. Its president, Mark Parkinson, has also argued that such a requirement is ""unrealistic"" and ""not possible"" because nursing homes can\'t find workers.\n\nNationwide, nursing homes are down more than 240,000 employees since the start of the pandemic, according to the Labor Department. Facilities across the country are grappling with numerous unfilled positions as a result of staff departures during the pandemic.\n\n""If they had a minimum staffing requirement that, if you were unable to meet, you could not operate, that would close every building in the country,"" Parkinson said during a media call following the release of the administration\'s plan.\n\nCurrent federal staffing requirements for nursing homes are vague\n\nThe federal government does already have some staffing requirements in place — for example, each facility must have a registered nurse on duty for eight hours per day — but the core language is vague.\n\nThe 1987 Nursing Home Reform Act, which brought sweeping changes to the industry, requires facilities to have ""sufficient"" staff so that residents can achieve or maintain their ""highest practicable"" physical, mental and psychosocial well-being.\n\n""It\'s so that each person gets exactly what they need to be the best they can be and live their best life,"" says Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at the Consumer Voice, a group focused on long-term care. ""What has been so ambiguous and subjective is how \'sufficient\' is interpreted.""\n\nOverwhelmed nursing assistants say understaffing leads to an assembly line approach to care\n\nIn Baltimore, Holly Ward is a geriatric nursing assistant at a nursing home that has earned an ""above average"" rating for staffing from CMS. Still, on some shifts, she has as many as 13 residents to dress, feed, clean, change, move. One after another.\n\n""So it becomes like an assembly line,"" Ward says.\n\nAnd not one that runs smoothly. Ward will find that while she\'s attending to one resident, another is incontinent. That resident may end up waiting in soiled bedclothes for a while.\n\n""To care for them, you have to give them dignity. That is the main factor they stress at the job, yet you don\'t give us the staff to provide that,"" Ward says.\n\nOften, to meet the basic needs of every resident, Ward says she ends up skipping other important components of their care, such as talking with them and providing emotional support.\n\n""They look to you for comfort, but then when you don\'t have time to adequately give them the comfort they deserve, it\'s not fair,"" says Ward. ""And then it\'s on your conscience.""\n\nNo state in the U.S. meets the federally recommended nursing home staffing levels\n\nMaryland, where Ward works, actually does have a minimum staffing requirement for nursing homes, as do most states. But those state-level requirements are all lower than what the federal government recommended more than two decades ago, the last time the issue was studied.\n\nIn a 2001 report, CMS found that in order to avoid bad outcomes, nursing home residents should each receive at least 4.1 hours of direct nursing care per day. In 29 states, including Maryland, the minimum staffing requirement is 3.5 hours or less, according to an analysis by the Consumer Voice. In some states, the minimum requirement is half the recommended level.\n\nTurnover at nursing homes is high as competition for workers has risen\n\nThe only place that has adopted the federal government\'s guidance of 4.1 hours of care per day is Washington, D.C.\n\n""We think about meeting the numbers every single day,"" says Tina Sandri, CEO of Forest Hills of DC. ""It was a daily struggle before COVID. It is even more so now.""\n\nTurnover at her facility, home to about 100 residents, is nearly triple what it was before the pandemic.\n\nBurnout and competition are major factors.\n\n""In D.C., you can work for Amazon at $19 an hour. You can be a dog walker for $18 an hour,"" she says.\n\nSandri struggles to get certified nursing assistants, who typically start at $15.20 an hour, in the door. Four out of 5 who initially express interest in a job don\'t come in for interviews.\n\nAs a nonprofit, Forest Hills of DC doesn\'t have the bandwidth to raise wages, Sandri says. Like most nursing homes in the U.S., it relies on Medicare and Medicaid for most of its funding.

This proposed rule builds on the President’s historic Action Plan for Nursing Home Reform launched in the 2022 State of the Union.\n\nToday’s action is one among many advanced by the Biden-Harris Administration to build a long-term care system where all older Americans can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high quality services in the setting of their choice, where family caregivers are adequately supported, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union.\n\n“Establishing minimum staffing standards for nursing homes will improve resident safety and promote high-quality care so residents and their families can have peace of mind,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “When facilities are understaffed, residents suffer. They might be unable to use the bathroom, shower, maintain hygiene, change clothes, get out of bed, or have someone respond to their call for assistance. Comprehensive staffing reforms can improve working conditions, leading to higher wages and better retention for this dedicated workforce.”\n\n“CMS is proud to be leading the President’s initiative to improve the lives of over 1.2 million residents who reside in Medicare and Medicaid-certified long-term care facilities, and those who will need that care in the future,” said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. “Today, we took an important first step to propose new staffing requirements that will hold nursing homes accountable and make sure that residents get the safe, high-quality care that they deserve.”\n\nUnder CMS’s proposal, nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid would be required to meet specific nurse staffing levels that promote safe, high-quality care for residents. Nursing homes would need to provide residents with a minimum of 0.55 hours of care from a registered nurse per resident per day, and 2.45 hours of care from a nurse aide per resident per day, exceeding existing standards in nearly all states. CMS estimates approximately three quarters (75%) of nursing homes would have to strengthen staffing in their facilities. As the long-term care sector continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed standards take into consideration local realities in rural and underserved communities through staggered implementation and exemptions processes.\n\nIn addition, nursing homes would also be required to ensure a registered nurse is on site 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and to complete robust facility assessments on staffing needs. Facilities would continue to be required to provide staffing that meets the needs of the individual residents they serve, which may require higher levels of staffing above the proposed minimum standards.\n\nCMS also proposes to require states to collect and report on compensation for workers as a percentage of Medicaid payments for those working in nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These policies build on CMS’ recent proposals to support compensation for direct care workers in home- and community-based settings and to publish Medicaid data on average hourly pay rates for home care workers. This enhanced transparency will aid efforts to support and stabilize the long-term care workforce across settings. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to strengthening access to high-quality long-term care both at home, in the community as well as in nursing homes and other facilities.\n\nAdditionally, CMS announced a national campaign to support staffing in nursing homes. As part of the HHS Workforce Initiative, CMS will work with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and other partners to make it easier for individuals to enter careers in nursing homes, investing over $75 million in financial incentives, such as scholarships and tuition reimbursement. This staffing campaign builds on other actions by HHS and the Department of Labor to build the nursing workforce.\n\n“Wages are an important part of job quality and drive challenges in recruitment and retention of direct care workers. Our research shows that in many places these workers can earn higher wages doing other entry-level work,” said Miranda Lynch-Smith, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.\n\nMore than 500,000 direct care workers provide care in nursing homes, assisting residents with daily tasks, such as bathing, dressing, mobility, and eating. This work, performed primarily by women of color, is significantly undervalued. Direct care workers across long-term care settings earn low wages, rarely receive health and retirement benefits, and experience high injury rates. Improving working conditions and wages will lead to improvements in the recruitment and retention of direct care workers and enable nursing staff to provide safer care.\n\nFindings published by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation show that wages for direct care workers trail other entry-level jobs. In 2019, median wages for nursing assistants were lower than the wages of other entry level jobs in 40 states and the District of Columbia. As an example, the median wage for nursing assistants in Louisiana is $10.90 per hour, compared to $13.41 for other entry-level positions. This is despite the significant demands of direct care jobs and their essential role in meeting the long-term care needs of older adults and people with disabilities.\n\nOther announcements from CMS and the HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) made today would increase transparency, enhance enforcement of existing standards, increase accountability, and ensure safe, high-quality, and dignified care for people living in nursing homes. These announcements include:\n\nIncreasing Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nImproving Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nEnsuring Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also prevent a transparent and accurate assessment of whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nCracking Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhancing Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe proposed rule is available at https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/current\n\nThe ASPE report is available at: https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/dcw-wages'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/world/americas/biden-will-lay-out-new-nursing-home-protections-in-his-state-of-the-union-speech.html', 'Headline': 'Biden will lay out new nursing home protections in his State of the ...', 'Snippet': 'President Biden will use his State of the Union address Tuesday night in part to announce steps to protect nursing home residents and hold providers accountable for unsafe and substandard care ...', 'Full_text': 'President Biden will use his State of the Union address Tuesday night in part to announce steps to protect nursing home residents and hold providers accountable for unsafe and substandard care, including by expanding inspections and financial penalties on what the White House is calling “bad actor nursing homes” and “poor-performing facilities.”\n\nMore than 1.4 million people in the United States live in more than 15,500 nursing homes, which receive reimbursement with tax dollars through two federal programs: Medicare and Medicaid. The pandemic has thrown into sharp relief the dangers of living in nursing homes, and also the challenges they face.\n\nNursing homes are caring for some of the nation’s most vulnerable people: older and disabled adults, often with chronic underlying conditions. Like all congregate living facilities, they are places where viruses spread easily. According to the White House, nursing home residents and staff members account for some 200,000 of the nearly 950,000 deaths in the United States from Covid-19.\n\nJen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday that Mr. Biden would unveil “new steps to protect seniors and other nursing home residents by cracking down on unsafe nursing homes.” The White House detailed the new initiatives in a fact sheet posted on Monday on its website.\n\nThey include: improving staffing levels; expanding inspectors and beefing up “scrutiny on more of the poorest performers”; improving transparency, including by creating a database to track and identify nursing home operators; and ensuring pandemic preparedness.\n\nThe administration is also taking aim at private equity firms in the nursing home business. Citing a March 2020 analysis by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, the White House said private equity firms’ investment in nursing homes had grown to more than $100 billion in 2018 from $5 billion in 2000, with about 5 percent of all nursing homes now owned by private equity firms.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The ...', 'Full_text': 'SciCheck Digest\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials were designed to study the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease, not transmission. But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

But a popular YouTube video spins a conspiracy theory that distorts legal codes to falsely claim otherwise.\n\nFull Story\n\nAll of the four COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. were tested in large, randomized controlled trials for safety and efficacy before the FDA granted them emergency use authorization and they were rolled out to the public.\n\nTwo of the vaccines are now fully approved: the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots. These are the vaccines the vast majority of vaccinated Americans have received.\n\nAs is standard in clinical trials, the volunteers in the COVID-19 vaccine trials were informed of the risks and benefits so they could decide whether to participate, or what is known as informed consent.\n\nYet a Jan. 7 YouTube video that racked up more than 300,000 views in its first three days falsely claims the trials were a sham. The video also incorrectly suggests the trial participants did not give informed consent.\n\n“A bombshell new report shows that the Department of Defense — yes the pentagon — controlled the COVID-19 program from the very beginning, and everything we were told was political theater, basically to cover it up, right down to the FDA vaccine approval process,” says host Clayton Morris, at the start of the video. “It was all theater. That means that human beings were used as props.”\n\nThe 17-minute video is an episode of the YouTube show Redacted, which Morris co-hosts with his wife and which has previously trafficked in misinformation, including about COVID-19. Morris is a former “Fox & Friends” host and real estate investor who moved to Portugal following fraud allegations by former clients.\n\nThe video features Alexandra, or Sasha, Latypova, who is described as “a former executive of a pharmaceutical contract research organization.” She has previously made media appearances with organizations opposed to vaccines, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Children’s Health Defense, and has written for the pseudoscientific website TrialSiteNews.\n\nIn the Redacted interview, Latypova makes a series of false claims, many predicated on her misreading of government contracts and the legal code. Lawyers with expertise in the area told us the claims are bunk.\n\nFalse Claim About ‘Theatrical’ Clinical Trials\n\nLatypova kicks off her interview by claiming “the Department of Defense used very shady contracting practices and also used several laws that were put in place previously … to shield pharmaceutical companies, to not conduct, you know, proper clinical trials.”\n\n“As a result, we have this theatrical performance called clinical trials, but they were actually not real,” she continues. “Based on the laws that are used here and then involved in this process, clinical trials are not required at all. And, and in fact they cannot be conducted.”\n\nThis is patently false. All of the vaccine clinical trials were very much real. Not only have thousands of Americans participated in these trials, some of whom have been interviewed for news stories, but there are reams of data from these trials that the FDA reviewed prior to issuing the emergency use authorizations and the approvals.\n\nThese data were also reviewed by multiple independent review groups for the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in publicly accessible meetings, and the results were also published in peer-reviewed journals. The notion that these trials were not real strains credulity and requires conspiratorial thinking.\n\nLatypova’s mischaracterization likely stems from her misreading of the laws governing emergency use authorizations, or EUAs. It’s true that an EUA, which can cover a variety of diagnostics, treatments or vaccines during an exceptional situation such as a pandemic, is different from a full approval — and does not necessarily require a clinical trial.\n\nHowever, the legal code specifically says that an EUA can consider data “from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if available.” And for the COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA made clear in guidance that clinical trials were required.\n\nAn October 2020 FDA guidance document states that for a COVID-19 vaccine “for which there is adequate manufacturing information to ensure its quality and consistency, issuance of an EUA would require a determination by FDA that the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its risks based on data from at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner.”\n\n“For vaccines (and new drugs like Paxlovid, which also received an EUA) the FDA always requires clinical trials,” Villanova University law professor Ana Santos Rutschman told us. “Technically, guidance is not binding,” she added, “but we’ve never seen FDA depart significantly from guidance it issues in any of these areas.”\n\nAnd of course, trials were indeed performed for all of the vaccines that received an EUA, contrary to Latypova’s claim that they were fake.\n\n“The difference between an EUA and other forms of regulation is that the standard for effectiveness is that ‘it is reasonable to believe’ that a product is effective,” Rutschman explained. “‘Reasonable to believe’ is a lower standard than the one required for full approval; this means that companies are able to submit clinical trial data to the FDA sooner than they normally would under the full approval pathway. But the clinical trials still have to be ok’ed by the FDA, which also reviews all the data generated during the trials, and keeps monitoring the product even after it is authorized under an EUA, as well as after full approval.”\n\n“Sasha Latypova’s argument is a classic example of a causal fallacy,” Jacob S. Sherkow, a law professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told us. “Latypova assumes that because some clinical investigations are not required under an EUA, they could not have occurred.”\n\n“It’s bogus as a matter of law, as a matter [of] logic, and a matter of fact,” he added.\n\nFalse Informed Consent Claim\n\nAnother of Latypova’s false claims is the suggestion that informed consent wasn’t obtained in the COVID-19 vaccine trials.\n\nShe cites the 21st Century Cures Act signed in 2016 by President Barack Obama, saying the law changed “the informed consent requirements, such that subjects don’t have to be necessarily informed of what’s going on if it’s deemed not in their best interest.”\n\nLatypova proceeds to suggest that this is what happened in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. “They don’t have to inform the subjects what it is, they can use a lot of secrecy, they don’t have to run clinical trials, they’re not required, because these products cannot be investigational products, that’s what the law says,” she says, repeating her claim about the trials. “If they cannot be investigational products, then we don’t have any investigation, we don’t have any clinical trial subjects. So that’s how they’re pulling this off.”\n\n“[I]t’s just nonsense,” Sherkow said. “There’s nothing in the CURES Act that says, ‘No informed consent for clinical trials.’”\n\nRutschman agreed, noting that the Cures Act allows for small modifications to informed consent in certain situations, but does not “do away with informed consent requirements.”\n\nOther scientists have published research analyzing the informed consent documents used in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. While the researchers concluded the forms should have been shorter and easier to read, it’s simply not true that such forms did not exist.\n\nLatypova’s related legal claim about “investigational products” refers to a particular part of the legal code about EUAs (21 U.S. Code § 360bbb–3(k)) that states the use of an EUA product “shall not be considered to constitute a clinical investigation.” But Rutschman said Latypova’s interpretation of those words is “entirely incorrect.”\n\nRather than meaning that an EUA product cannot be studied in a clinical trial, as Latypova has incorrectly assumed, the law is saying that an EUA product still needs to be studied or continued to be studied in a clinical trial to receive full approval, Rutschman said.\n\n“The provision is saying this is a particular pathway to bring products to market during an emergency, but use of these products is not a clinical investigation; if you’re going to seek full approval you have to continue running trials even as you make the vaccines/drugs available under an EUA,” she explained.\n\nOther Assorted Claims\n\nAmong Latypova’s numerous other false claims (we aren’t covering them all) is the suggestion that the pandemic was “planned” and that an unnamed “they” — presumably the government — want to relinquish control to the World Health Organization.\n\n“The pre-planning goes [back] years,” Latypova says. “For example, there is pandemic enterprise. It’s a quasi-private, quasi-government enterprise that’s been set up in 2013 that involves 10 heads of federal agencies.” She calls the group a “cabal” and claims the majority of the efforts were focused on maintaining secrecy.\n\n“It’s almost like they knew this was coming,” Morris interjects. “This is where we talk about conspiracy theories on the show. I mean, it’s all true.”\n\nIt’s unclear which entity Latypova has in mind. The most likely candidate is a group known as the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise. It’s primarily made up of officials in multiple agencies, but includes industry partners, and helps to coordinate the government’s response during public health emergencies. It was created in 2006.\n\nIn any case, it’s incorrect to suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. Conspiracy theorists have made similar claims before, as we’ve written. The reality is that well before 2019, scientists and government officials had been concerned about pandemics, including those caused by coronaviruses. Trying to prepare for them is not evidence that they were orchestrated or planned.\n\nNear the end of the video, Morris suggests that “they’re already planning the next one” — presumably referring to the government and the next pandemic — and Latypova agrees.\n\n“The next important thing that they want to do is give up our sovereignty to WHO,” she says, referring to the International Health Regulations.\n\nWe’ve explained before that the WHO can make recommendations for countries to follow during global health emergencies, but the WHO doesn’t have authority over countries to force compliance.\n\nIt’s worth noting that while Latypova and Morris make much of the Department of Defense’s role in the COVID-19 vaccine program, there is nothing unusual about it.\n\n“DoD is always very involved in vaccine R&D,” Rutschman said, noting that historically, many vaccine-preventable diseases occur outside of the U.S. where American troops are often deployed. “[I]t’s totally normal for DoD to be the contracting agency; as funders, they have an interest in demanding that their funding recipients perform R&D that is compliant with FDA regs and likely to obtain authorization/approval if the resulting product is good.”\n\nAs for the claim the Department of Defense used “shady” contracting methods, Rutschman explained that the contracting mechanism, known as “other transaction authority,” or OTA, simply allows the department to purchase items or services quickly — and is hardly unprecedented.\n\n“DoD had used the OTA pathway many times before COVID-19,” she said. “This form of contracting enables the government to move faster; it is perfectly legal and well-regulated.”\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s articles correcting health misinformation are made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Nevertheless, the substance of what she meant remains the same.""\n\nSimilar posts have also been shared hundreds of thousands of times globally in French, English, Spanish, Croatian, German, Finnish, Thai and Malaysian.\n\nThe posts prompted a flurry of angry responses accusing Pfizer of allegedly hiding the information from the public.\n\nOne commented: ""My my, so this revelation is finally coming out into the open, but they all need holding to account and fines, prison etc they should be made to pay for what they have done.""\n\nBut Pfizer\'s response during the committee hearing was not an ""admission"" as the posts allege; the information has been publicly reported since 2020.\n\nNot new information\n\nThe information that Pfizer\'s Covid-19 jabs were not tested for stopping transmission has been included in a report published here on December 10, 2020 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThe question of transmission is addressed on page 48 of the FDA document under a section titled: ""Vaccine effectiveness against the transmission of SARS-CoV-2"".\n\nThe document states: ""Data are limited to assess the effect of the vaccine against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from individuals who are infected despite vaccination.""\n\n""Additional evaluations including data from clinical trials and from vaccine use post-authorization will be needed to assess the effect of the vaccine in preventing virus shedding and transmission, in particular in individuals with asymptomatic infection,"" the document continues.\n\nNevertheless, the report also noted that ""demonstrated high efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19 may translate to overall prevention of transmission in populations with high enough vaccine uptake.""\n\nHowever, ""it is possible that if efficacy against asymptomatic infection were lower than efficacy against symptomatic infection, asymptomatic cases in combination with reduced mask-wearing and social distancing could result in significant continued transmission,"" it states.\n\nThe same information has been widely reported by multiple media organisations in December 2020 -- including AFP here.\n\nContacted by AFP, the Pfizer-BioNTech laboratory said in an email on October 14, 2022, that ""the phase III clinical trial (the protocol for which was published in November 2020)"" was not “designed to assess vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 transmission.”\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) explains on its site that certain ""benefits might not be known when a Covid-19 vaccine is initially approved.""\n\n""The benefits only become clearer after the vaccine is in use,"" explains the agency, specifying that over time, health authorities are better able to know ""whether the vaccine can reduce the spread of the virus in the community. Reducing transmission will depend on many factors, including how many people get vaccinated.""\n\nIn a document dated February 19, 2021, the EMA wrote that from the conclusions of the clinical trials conducted on the Pfizer vaccine: ""It is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission.""\n\nClinical trials\n\nDuring a clinical trial, measuring the impact of a vaccine on the chain of transmission is complex, experts told AFP. Transmission depends on a large number of factors, which are not necessarily reproducible in a clinical trial.\n\n“The trials involve a few tens of thousands of people and at the time there was no such circulation of the virus with the original strain. The vaccine had prevented a lot of contamination compared to the placebo, so we would have had very few people infected despite the vaccination. Then, it would still have been necessary to follow them to find out if they could have infected other people who were not necessarily included in the trial, which is very complicated to objectify"", epidemiologist Antoine Flahault said on October 13, 2022.\n\n“The experts wanted solid criteria, and this is measured by looking at the impact of the vaccine on deaths and hospitalisations, and not on models of transmission”, he concluded.\n\nThe results of Pfizer\'s large-scale clinical trial -- carried out on several thousand volunteers -- were published in the New England Journal of Medicine the same month. The trial found the jab was effective in reducing severe Covid-19.\n\nMultiple experts told AFP the goal of clinical trials has always been to measure the Pfizer jab\'s effectiveness against severe forms of Covid-19 -- not in stopping transmission.\n\nThey said transmission depends on many factors -- including circulating variants of the coronavirus at the time -- which are not necessarily reproducible within a clinical trial.\n\n""If in addition this vaccine proved to be effective on transmission, it was even better, but that was not the goal of vaccine development at the level of clinical trials,"" epidemiologist Yves Buisson told AFP on October 13, 2022.\n\nEffective vaccine\n\nIn the results of the phase III clinical trial (conducted on approximately 44,000 people) of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, detailed in this document from the United States Medicines Agency (FDA) dated December 10, 2020, it is indicated on page 46 that among the “known benefits” of the product is the “reduction in the risk of Covid-19 confirmed at least 7 days after the second dose” as well as “after dose 1 and before dose 2”.\n\nThe document also notes that the vaccine allows ""the reduction of the risk of severe Covid-19 confirmed after dose 1"".\n\nThe effectiveness against severe forms -- already strongly suggested in the results of clinical trials -- was then verified during vaccination campaigns around the world, as several experts explained to AFP in the context of a previous verification investigation.\n\nSeveral studies ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) looking at data analysing vaccination campaigns -- particularly in the UK and Israel -- have shown that Covid vaccines not only show efficacy against severe and symptomatic forms of disease but also that vaccines have reduced the risk of contamination on the original strain.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9893920/', 'Headline': 'Facebook versus the BMJ: when fact checking goes wrong', 'Snippet': 'The Lead Stories article said that none of the flaws identified by The BMJ’s whistleblower, Brook Jackson, would “disqualify” the data collected from the main Pfizer vaccine trial.

The article claims Pfizer documents reveal ""thousands of side effects that occurred at an alarming rate, which were as a direct result of taking"" the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nSimilar misleading claims, often shared with the hashtag #pfizerdocuments, have spread across social media in multiple languages. AFP has debunked them in French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Serbian.\n\nAFP examines the origin of the documents and the inaccurate claims below.\n\nThe \'Pfizer documents\'\n\nOn social media, the phrase ""Pfizer documents"" is usually a reference to data that is gradually being made public by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nA group called Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency (PHMPT) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the FDA in August 2021 to gain access to all the data used to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nInitially, the FDA said it would release 500 pages per month, a rate considered far too slow by PHMPT as about 330,000 pages fall under the FOIA request. In January 2022, a Texas judge ruled that the FDA should release the documents at the rate of ""more than 12,000 pages"" on or before January 31, then ""55,000 pages every 30 days"" starting on or before March 1.\n\nAs of May 12, PHMPT had made 238 sets of documents available for download.\n\nMore than 5 billion people are estimated to have received a dose of a Covid-19 vaccine worldwide.\n\nHealth authorities including the World Health Organization have monitored the safety of the shot, and many independent scientists maintain that this data shows that the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks, even as misleading claims are made based on each release of documents\n\nList of side effects\n\nMultiple social media posts claim a list of dangerous side effects was identified in the documents from Pfizer.\n\n""Pfizer Drops Deadly Side Effects Document Bomb on Vaccine Consumers,"" says one post on Facebook.\n\n""Pfizer side effects list release. Not a joke!"" claims another.\n\nBut Aurélie Grandvuillemin, deputy head of the Burgundy Regional Pharmacovigilance Center told AFP: ""This is in no way a list of the adverse effects reported from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.""\n\nThis list, which has been available on the PHMPT website since November 2021, details ""adverse events of special interest."" These are conditions that must be subjected to special monitoring for reasons including their association with previous vaccines. The list includes symptoms reported following vaccination for which no causal association has been proven.\n\nIn Canada, the government is monitoring myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, or inflammation of the lining around the heart. It recommends the vaccine, and has found that ""the number of reports of myocarditis/pericarditis following the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty Covid-19 vaccine is higher than what would be expected in the general population of males and females less than 30 years old and primarily following the second dose.""\n\nHowever, Glen Pyle, a professor of molecular cardiology at Canada\'s University of Guelph, and Jennifer Huang, associate professor of pediatric cardiology at Oregon Health and Science University in the US, wrote in The Conversation in January 2022 that, ""in cases of myocarditis following Covid-19 vaccination, the vast majority of cases are mild and resolve quickly."" They said there is a greater risk of heart damage from a SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAFP also has debunked claims about this list in French, German, Serbian and Dutch.\n\n\'1,200 deaths\'\n\n""Pfizer Data Dump Reveals More than 1200 People Died Within One Month of Taking Covid-19 Vaccine,"" claims a May 8, 2022 online article.\n\nThe article repeats a claim AFP debunked in English and French in December 2021. It pulls information from the same document behind the claims about adverse events, not newly released data.\n\nPfizer spokeswoman Dervila Keane told AFP the figure of 1,223 fatalities reflects reports from sources that include health officials in several countries, without any verification of the cause. It does not indicate specific causes of death, and the fatalities may include people with ""various illnesses"" such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, she said.\n\nFDA spokeswoman Alison Hunt also said health care providers must report any death following vaccination, even if it is unclear whether the vaccine was the cause.\n\n""Reviews by FDA and CDC have determined that the vast majority of the deaths reported are not directly attributable to the vaccines,"" she said, adding that reports of deaths after Covid-19 vaccination are ""rare.""\n\n\'12 percent efficacy\'\n\n""The next batch of Pfizer documents are out and in conclusion: The mandatory #Pfizer Vaccine was not 95% effective, only 12% effective...but only for about a week. then it drops to less than 1% effective,"" claims a May 5, 2022 tweet.\n\nSimilar claims about the efficacy of the vaccine can be found across social media in English and French.\n\nPfizer reported at the end of its clinical trials in November 2020 that its Covid-19 vaccine was 95 percent effective starting 28 days after the first dose.\n\nPfizer followed 18,198 people who received the vaccine, and 8 tested positive for Covid-19 a week after the second dose of the vaccine. This is compared to 162 people testing positive amid 18,325 people in the placebo group.\n\nMany claims that the vaccine was only 12 percent effective can be traced to an April 3, 2022 Substack article published by Sonia Elijah, an independent British journalist who writes for Trial Site News, a website which has promoted unproven Covid-19 treatments and has criticized public health authorities.\n\nIn her blog post, Elijah claims the real vaccine efficacy should be calculated with figures on page 42 of data Pfizer shared with the FDA that has been public since December 2020. It says: ""Among 3,410 total cases of suspected but unconfirmed Covid-19 in the overall study population, 1,594 occurred in the vaccine group vs. 1,816 in the placebo group.""\n\nHowever, researchers say it is incorrect to use this data to calculate overall vaccine efficacy because those individuals did not have Covid-19 cases confirmed by a PCR test.\n\nThe clinical trial protocols made public by Pfizer make clear that a participant was told to make an appointment for a PCR test if they experienced certain symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat or loss of taste/smell.\n\nJeffrey Morris, director of biostatistics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, explained on his website that the 3,410 ""suspected but unconfirmed"" cases were people who had ""any symptom mentioned in the list, which of course could come from many causes not just Covid-19 infections.""\n\nHe said: ""Since obviously the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was not intended to prevent all coughs, fevers, chills, sore throats, muscle pain, shortness of breath, vomiting, etc., from any cause, it would be ridiculous to include all reports of such common symptoms as Covid-19 cases for the purpose of computing Vaccine Efficacy.""\n\nStudies have confirmed strong protection against severe disease. The European Medicines Agency reported in January 2022 that preliminary results showed the vaccine also continued to protect against severe disease and hospitalization during an outbreak of the Omicron variant.\n\nPregnant and lactating women\n\n""Remember, \'The vaccine is safe for pregnant women\'- let me introduce the paperwork dumped by Pfizer, 50k pages. Now we know why they wanted to keep this hidden for 50+years,"" says a May 4, 2022 tweet.\n\nThe post includes an image of vaccine guidance, underlined to highlight: ""COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT126b2 is not recommended during pregnancy.""\n\nAs explained in a previous fact-check, this document was not released by the FDA. Instead, it is vaccine guidance published for UK health professionals in December 2020.\n\nA spokesperson for the UK\'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confirmed the origin of the document, and that it does not reflect the current vaccine guidance.\n\nVictoria Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, told AFP on May 10, 2022: ""Because pregnant individuals were not included in the clinical trials, for the first few weeks of the UK\'s vaccine rollout, it was not offered to them. However, from 1 January 2021, in recognition of the fact that Covid can cause severe disease in pregnancy, including preterm birth and stillbirth, we extended vaccination to pregnant people at high risk.""\n\nHealth officials in the UK, US, France and Canada recommend the Covid-19 vaccine for pregnant individuals.\n\nTransmission of the virus\n\n""New Study & Confidential Pfizer Docs. prove COVID \'Vaccine Shedding\' has been and still is occurring with dangerous consequences,"" says the headline of a May 10, 2022 article from The Exposé, a website with a history of circulating inaccurate health information.\n\nIt claims: ""A confidential Pfizer document had already confirmed exposure to the mRNA injections was perfectly possible by skin-to-skin contact and breathing the same air as someone who had been given the Covid-19 jab.""\n\nThis claim is false, as AFP has previously reported.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains on its website that the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech shots ""are mRNA vaccines that do not contain the live virus that causes Covid-19 and, therefore, cannot give someone Covid-19.""\n\nThis is how mRNA vaccines work:\n\nDasantila Golemi-Kotra, a microbiologist at Canada\'s York University, also confirmed that vaccinated individuals are not infecting others.\n\n""No spike protein gets shed when we get vaccinated,"" she said.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-misinterpretation-leads-false-000542264.html', 'Headline': 'Fact check: Misinterpretation leads to false claim about Pfizer ... - Yahoo', 'Snippet': 'The claim: 44% of pregnant women who participated in a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine trial had miscarriages.

But when those figures were viewed as a share of the economy (GDP), Australia\'s contribution was half that of Sweden\'s, for example.\n\nJust hours before Mr Albanese made his latest comments, updated data was released showing that Sweden had now overtaken Australia even on the dollar-for-dollar comparison.\n\nIn addition, Fact Check previously noted that other non-NATO members, including Sweden, also made multilateral contributions to Ukraine\'s military via the EU.\n\nEdited by Ellen McCutchan and David Campbell, with thanks to Sarah Liversidge'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/aug/29/viral-image/its-not-true-nearly-half-pregnant-women-pfizers-co/', 'Headline': 'Pfizer vaccine trial miscarriages stat wrong - PolitiFact', 'Snippet': 'The story said a Pfizer document on ""adverse events"" from vaccines ""reveals chilling data showing 44% of pregnant women participating in Pfizer’s mRNA COVID vaccine trial suffered miscarriages ...', 'Full_text': 'Since COVID-19 vaccines became widely available in the United States, PolitiFact has debunked several claims seemingly aimed at discouraging pregnant people from getting a shot.

The report contains a table showing 50 women reporting pregnancy after vaccination. There are also 22 reports of spontaneous abortion adverse events. But these 22 reports aren’t all unique — nine were mentioned twice.

From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12853-7', 'Headline': 'A comprehensive evaluation of COVID-19 policies and outcomes in 50 ...', 'Snippet': 'Searches for insomnia have been used to assess the mental impact of COVID-19 8,16,17 more commonly than searches for anxiety, panic attack 17,18, depression 8, or suicide 8. Correlation analyses', 'Full_text': 'The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic unleashed extraordinary challenges on humanity. Governments implemented various policies aimed at containing the spread of infection and stabilizing their economies. Many institutions—including the Economist Intelligence Unit1, Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)2, NLI Research Institute3, and Bloomberg4—have assessed global responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, evaluation criteria differ across these institutions (Supplementary Information 1–3), and their studies have had different focuses and produced varying evaluation results.\n\nHere, we introduce a set of criteria for assessing virus-containment effectiveness, where the aim of containment is to minimize harm to societies and economies. The proposed criteria include several previously examined indicators, namely monthly cases per 100,000 members of a population (per capita), fatality rate, and GDP loss. Additionally, because OxCGRT\'s stringency index (SI)2 cannot reflect rigor accurately based on monthly case numbers (Supplementary Information 4), we propose a lockdown efficiency (LE) parameter, which relates stringency to incidence5 (Supplementary Information 5). We include the following five OxCGRT indicators of health-system policies2: public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, facial coverings, and (from December 2020 onward) vaccination policy.\n\nTo track long-term impacts on health literacy and mental health, we collated data from Google searches for “wash hands”, “face mask”, and “insomnia” as surrogates for national population health literacy and mental health. Surveys on COVID-19–related mental health and health literacy are mostly based on self-reported, cross-sectional studies and rarely multinational6. However, population health literacy and mental health trends have been shown to be reflected in search volume trends7,8. The search engine analysis website Google Trends has been used for population mental-health surveillance as well as for long-term tracking of depression9 and suicide10.\n\nThe availability of COVID-19 vaccines cast new hope for curbing the pandemic. Until August 19, 2021, the World Health Organization had issued only emergency-use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines11. By September 12, 2021, 42% of the worldwide population had received at least one dose of a vaccine12. Therefore, we incorporate vaccine-related indicators into our research.\n\nWe propose a set of ten indices, including four government policy and hygiene education (GP&HE) indicators and six vital health and socioeconomic (VH&SE) measures. Our research is divided into pre- and post-vaccine availability phases. For the first phase (March 2020 to November 2020), we focus on evaluating the appropriateness of the LE indicator, which we developed using linear mixed models to determine how each GP&HE indicator correlates with each VH&SE measure. In the second phase during which there was ongoing vaccine distribution (December 2020 to November 2021), we added vaccine-related indicators to enable more comprehensive containment performance analyses. We compared indicator scores for 50 distinctly governed territories.\n\nOur scoring system, modified from previous studies2,3, includes GP&HE indicators and VH&SE measures. The GP&HE indicators include: LE; health-system policies; health literacy indicators; and vaccine coverage of the population (December 2020 onward). The VH&SE measures include: one-month cases per capita; infection growth rate; fatality rate; GDP loss due to the pandemic; unemployment rate; and psychological impact (Table 1)2,5,13,14,15.\n\nGP&HE indicators\n\nGovernment response is associated with COVID-19 incidence2. Our newly introduced indicator LE is calculated based on COVID-19 incidence data and the SI2, a factor that does not account for COVID-19 incidence. LE has a reasonable correlation with one-month cases per capita (Supplementary Information 4 and 5).\n\nWe developed another indicator called health-system policies, which is a simple average of the four OxCGRT indicators: public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, and facial coverings2. Each of these indicators is derived from daily data, and thus could potentially be represented with monthly means or modes. We used monthly modes as the representative score for each month. From December 2020 onward, we added OxCGRT vaccination policy2 to the calculation of the health-system policies indicator.\n\nHealth literacy is beneficial to reducing the spread of infectious diseases7. Therefore, Google Trends were used to obtain search trends for “wash hands” and “face mask”, which act as surrogate indicators of health literacy7 (Supplementary Information 6).\n\nFor the second phase of the research (December 2020–November 2021), we added the aforementioned indicator people covered by vaccines15 by modifying the calculation of health-system policies to include vaccination policy. This indicator was calculated as the ratio of the number of vaccine doses administered to the number of doses required for full vaccination. For simplicity, we assumed that every individual in each country needs only two doses of vaccine.\n\nVH&SE measures\n\nNLI Research Institute definitions of one-month cases per capita, infection growth rate, and fatality rate were adopted3. Unemployment rate and GDP loss were defined relative to the same timeframe in 2020–2021 and 2019–2020 (Table 1). We quantified change in searches for “insomnia” to indicate the extent of the pandemic’s impact on a population’s mental health. Searches for insomnia have been used to assess the mental impact of COVID-198,16,17 more commonly than searches for anxiety, panic attack17,18, depression8, or suicide8.\n\nCorrelation analyses\n\nIn phase one, linear mixed models were used to explore the relationship between each GP&HE indicator and VH&SE measure. Because these values vary over time and may affect each other, we conducted two-stage analyses (Supplementary Information 4). We tested LE and SI legitimacy2. In phase two, we calculated Spearman\'s rank correlation coefficients to determine whether the indicator “people covered by vaccines” correlates with three vital health indicators, namely one-month cases per capita, infection growth rate, and one-month case fatality rate.\n\nScoring of GP&HE indicators and VH&SE measures\n\nWe ranked the performance of 50 countries and territories according to total indicator scores (Supplementary Information 7 and 8), where a higher score implies better containment performance. We graphed the score distribution (Supplementary Figs. S11-S31) to visualize the relationship between pre-pandemic baseline risk levels and monthly containment scores. We assigned all 50 countries and territories to low, medium, or high baseline risk categories and calculated monthly average containment scores for each risk level (Supplementary Information 9).\n\nGeographic comparison\n\nWe calculated monthly average containment scores for six geographic group and conducted two-sample t-tests and Mann–Whitney U-tests to compare containment performance between Latin American and non-Latin American countries and between Asian and non-Asian countries prior to vaccine introduction (Supplementary Information 10 and 11). Additionally, we compared mean containment performance scores before versus after inclusion of vaccine indicators (Fig. 2).\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted via SAS software (version 9.4); P values were two-tailed with 0.05 significance level.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nWe conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our study results in relation to uncertainties in the indicator calculation methods and the inclusion/exclusion of Google Trends indicators. Nine scenarios were evaluated (e.g. daily score means vs. modes; see Supplementary Table S35). The results obtained with different methods of calculating indices are given in Supplementary Tables S36–S40. Revised calculations with the inclusion of Google Trends are reported in Supplementary Tables S41–S44. The results obtained with the main scenarios (as defined in Table 1) are shown in Supplementary Tables S45 and S46, with the former including Google Trends indicators and the latter excluding Google Trends indicators. For the sensitivity analysis, we compared: (1) data in each of Supplementary Tables S36–S40 to the results in Supplementary Table S46; (2) data in each of Supplementary Tables S41–S44 to the results in Supplementary Table S45; and (3) data in each of Supplementary Tables S36–S39 to data in respective Supplementary Tables S41–S44 (i.e., Supplementary Table S41 vs. Supplementary Table S36, Supplementary Table S42 vs. Supplementary Table S37; Supplementary Table S43 vs. Supplementary Table S38; Supplementary Table S44 vs. Supplementary Table S39).\n\nEthical approval\n\nThe institutional review board of the National Health Research Institutes approved this study (EC1091110-E-R1).\n\nComparison between LE and SI prior to vaccine availability\n\nTwo-stage linear mixed models revealed no reasonable relationship between OxCGRT’s SI and one-month cases per capita (Supplementary Information 4). For each unit increase in the SI in July 2020, the estimated one-month cases per capita in August 2020 increased by 7.83 people (P = 0.03; Supplementary Table S2). Similar trends are observable for other months, contradicting the expectation that an increase in government policies in month s should reduce case numbers in month s + 1.\n\nFor every unit of increase in LE (defined in Table 1) in month s, the estimated one-month cases per capita in month s + 1 decreases. For each unit of increase in LE in September and October 2020, one-month cases per capita in October and November 2020 decrease by 629.55 and 597.94 people, respectively (both P < 0.0001; Supplementary Table S3). Although the relationships between LE and one-month cases per capita are not statistically significant in other months, we observe a consistent downward trend in cases subsequent to lockdowns.\n\nFrom our analyses, we deduce that our LE indicator is legitimate, and that the SI does not have a reasonable correlation with one-month cases per capita. Therefore, we use LE as an indicator in our subsequent evaluation.\n\nTwo stage-linear mixed models also show that the health-system policy in month s does impact fatality in month s + 1 within some periods of time. For every unit of increase in health-system policies in April and May 2020, fatality rates in May and June 2020 decrease by 7.84% and 3.86%, respectively (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table S4).\n\nCOVID-19 containment effectiveness\n\nPerformance scores for citizens’ health literacy and insomnia (Google Trends data) for six territories over the 21-month study period are shown in Fig. 1. All monthly COVID-19 containment rankings and scores from March 2020 to November 2021 are shown in Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 and in Supplementary Tables S13–S33 (Supplementary Information 8 and 12). The best performing countries and territories in 2020 are located mainly in Asia and Oceania, including Taiwan, the Republic of Korea (Korea), and New Zealand.\n\nBaseline risk\n\nLow- and middle-baseline-risk territories are concentrated in Asia, including Vietnam, Korea, and Taiwan, whereas high-baseline-risk nations are located mostly in Europe, including France and the UK. Countries in the Americas span the three risk levels (Fig. 3a). In the first phase, most low- and middle-baseline-risk countries and territories achieved better containment than their high-risk counterparts. Some countries, such as New Zealand and Finland, were able to restrain COVID-19 transmission despite having high baseline risk levels (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Information 9 and Supplementary Fig. S32a).\n\nGeographical comparison prior to vaccine allocation\n\nPrior to vaccine distribution, Latin America was severely impacted by the pandemic, while Oceania and Asia had good containment (Fig. 4a). Non-Latin American nations achieved better overall containment performance than their Latin American counterparts, which were severely affected. From April 2020 to September 2020, performance differed between these two groups, with and without Google Trends data inclusion (P < 0.027; Supplementary Information 10).\n\nAsian governments outperformed their non-Asian counterparts in phase one (Supplementary Information 11). From March to November 2020, with the exception of July 2020, performance scores of Asian countries were higher than those of non-Asian countries, with and without Google Trends data inclusion (P < 0.039).\n\nAsian countries performed dramatically better than non-Asian countries in LE and health-system policies early in the pandemic (April 2020 LE scores P = 0.007; March/April 2020 health-system policy scores P < 0.003). These results suggest that Asian governments enacted effective policies early (Supplementary Information 11).\n\nScoring system robustness\n\nSensitivity analyses revealed that (1) changing indicator calculation methods and (2) adding Google Trends indicators altered overall rankings slightly (Supplementary Information 13).\n\nPerformance after vaccine distribution\n\nThe best performers in 2020 were mostly in Asia and Oceania, including Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Thailand, and New Zealand. After vaccine indicators are included, the containment performance scores of these countries decrease. Inclusion of vaccine indicators from December 2020 onward results in higher containment performance scores in Singapore, Peru, Chile, Colombia, and Argentina (Figs. 2, 3b,c and 4). Among the six geographic regions analyzed, North American countries have the highest vaccine coverage. Their containment performance improves rapidly when vaccine indicators are included. Similar improvements are observed in Europe and Latin America (Fig. 4). Most high-baseline risk countries benefit from their high vaccination coverage (Supplementary Fig. S32).\n\nVaccination coverage\n\nIn the first 6 months of vaccine distribution, one-month cases per capita in month t correlates positively with vaccine coverage in month t and subsequent months. With the exception of the relationship between one-month cases per capita in May 2021 and people covered by vaccines in August 2021, all remaining months correlated (P < 0.0246). In the first 3 months after vaccine distribution ensued (December 2020–February 2021), people covered by vaccines in month t correlated negatively with infection growth rate in the subsequent t + 3, t + 4, or t + 5 months (P < 0.0461). Starting in March 2021, people covered by vaccines correlates negatively with infection growth rate in respective subsequent months, though the relationship does not reach statistical significance for all months. A delayed negative correlation of people covered by vaccines with fatality rate can be seen. Starting from June 2021, the number of people vaccinated in month t correlated negatively with fatality rate in month t and subsequent months (P < 0.0394) (Supplementary Tables S47–S49).\n\nTo evaluate COVID-19 containment performance impartially, we developed and tested a comprehensive evaluation method that accounts for GP&HE indicators, VH&SE measures, and vaccination. LE captures a nation’s effectiveness in enacting measures according to recent incidence. As variants continue to emerge, a new normal, in which pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions are considered should be established. Because it is unreasonable to expect life to normalize completely in the short term, we did not include the global normalcy index19 in our analyses.\n\nOur sensitivity analysis showed that inclusion of the Google Trends indicator altered the overall rankings of the 50 examined countries and territories slightly. We included it for three reasons: Google Trends data reflect health literacy and impacts on mental health7,8; none of the global institutions assessing COVID-19 containment effectiveness have included public responses in their evaluation criteria; and we believe that public response is important for transmission control.\n\nPrior to vaccine allocation, some countries and territories in Asia and Oceania were more successful at suppressing COVID-19 outbreaks than their European and American counterparts. They exhibited a relative weakening of containment performance after inclusion of the vaccine indicator (since December 2020), likely due, at least in part, to their lower vaccination coverage (Supplementary Information 12, Fig. 4).\n\nNew Zealand and Singapore emerged as the most stable performers. New Zealand has been steadfast in its fight against the vexatious COVID-19, increasing its LE to overcome spikes in infection (March/April 2020) and in fatality (May 2020). Successful containment has contributed to their economic stability during the first phase of pandemic (Supplementary Information 12). After New Zealand was invaded by the Delta variant in August 202120, the number of confirmed cases and infection rates increased, and New Zealand responded with an accelerated vaccination strategy (Supplementary Information 12).\n\nAlthough Singapore did not control rapid viral spread initially, they recovered from outbreaks well. Following a 5-month period of rising cases (April–August 2020), the Singapore government improved its health-system policies and LE, leading to decreased case numbers thereafter. Since January 2021, Singapore has been administering vaccines efficiently, making it a model nation for curbing COVID-19 (Supplementary Information 12). However, the surge in coronavirus infections and confirmed cases in Singapore since September 2021 may be related to Singapore’s “coexisting with COVID-19” strategy and the Delta variant outbreak21,22. Whether Singapore can achieve the goal of ""live with the virus"" has become the focus of global attention.\n\nChanges in containment performance scores of six locations associated with notable performance, activities, or policies are shown in Fig. 1. Denmark and the UK have high vaccination coverage23. Denmark lifted restrictions on September 10, 202124. Starting on July 19, 2021, the UK lifted most of its restrictions and removed social distancing recommendations25. In all US regions, restrictions have eased and people have returned to generally normal life26. The 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games took place in Tokyo, Japan from July 23 to August 8 and from August 24 to September 5 of 2021, respectively27. Vietnam was Asia\'s top-performing economy in 202028. Taiwan has been praised for its 253-day streak without local infections29.\n\nDenmark\'s infection growth increased rapidly from September 2020 to January 2021, though their fatality rate remained low. Transmission was mitigated through strict health-system policies, improved LE, and mass vaccinations. Although the number of confirmed cases increased after May 2021, the fatality rate was low. The pandemic within Denmark appeared to be under stable control, but at the end of the study Denmark faced another new wave of outbreaks, the development of which remains to be seen (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nContainment performance in the UK was not satisfactory in phase one. The UK improved LE and health-system policies while administering vaccinations on a massive scale. These efforts enabled a gradual containment of COVID-19 transmission, which was suppressed by March 2021. There was a case/infection growth surge in June 2021 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nThe USA did not control infection well in the first phase, but its containment performance improved in the second phase. They have endured large numbers of confirmed cases with cascading regional surges (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nJapan adopted inclusive health-system policies. Although their confirmed cases increased during the 2021 Olympics, Japan had several prior waves of increased case numbers, including two in 2021 (January and May). Whether the increase in confirmed cases during the Olympics can be attributed to Olympic event gatherings remains to be clarified (Supplementary Information 12).\n\nVietnam performed well in early but experienced a short-term containment performance decline in August 2020. Vietnam controlled an outbreak that emerged in February 2021 successfully. Infection growth in Vietnam has been relatively high since May 2021, and was only slightly contained until October, but then increased again in November. Transmission in late summer 2021 may reflect Delta variant invasion under low vaccination coverage (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nTaiwan is an exemplary case. COVID-19 transmission was suppressed early owing to a rapid response by Taiwan\'s Central Epidemic Command Center with cooperation from local government agencies and the public30. Taiwan suffered a case surge under low vaccine coverage in May and June 2021. The Central Epidemic Command Center responded with intensive data gathering, expansive testing, quarantines, and stringent non-pharmaceutical policies31. Faced with the highly transmissible Delta variant, Taiwan suppressed case numbers within 2 ~ 3 months (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nWhile countries seek to increase vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness has been tested by the Delta variant and breakthrough infections. In addition to vaccination, non-pharmacological interventions, such as handwashing, masking, and physical distancing, remain important for preventing transmission.\n\nPublic health implications\n\nOur research suggests that the top performing nations tend to enact rigorous health system policies and locally-appropriate lockdown measures, especially early in the pandemic (Supplementary Information 12, and Supplementary Table S11). Asian countries’ border control policies were implemented earlier than non-Asian countries. In Asian and non-Asian countries, the median times to any border closure from the first reported case in China were 24.50 and 67.50 days, respectively (P = 0.0003), and the median times to any border closure from the first domestic case within each country were -10.50 and 8.00 days, respectively (P = 0.0027) (Supplementary Table S50, Supplementary Information 15). Notwithstanding, stringent lockdown measures should not be enacted without careful consideration, and lockdown policies should be adjusted in response to recent incidence. Flexibility in their implementation can yield containment with minimal harm to societies, economies, and mental health.\n\nLimitations\n\nSeveral methodological limitations should be noted. First, we include unemployment rate and GDP loss, but not international aid, economic stimulus packages, or other fiscal measures. Second, Google Trends data do not represent a random sampling and may exclude vulnerable groups without internet access or those not actively searching. Third, ideally, only local infection rates should be considered to obtain precise LE measurements. However, because daily local case data are not fully available, we used incidence data inclusive of imported cases to determine LE scores. Therefore, minor inaccuracies in our LE data are expected (Supplementary Information 5).'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14088-7', 'Headline': 'A cross-country comparison of Covid-19 containment measures and their ...', 'Snippet': 'Background European countries are still searching to eliminate or contain the Covid-19 pandemic.

In fact, the progress of modern medicine has allowed the development in record time of effective and safe vaccines to prevent Covid-19 symptomatic infection, severe disease, admissions to hospital, and deaths [2,3,4]. Unfortunately, it has not been possible yet to ensure equitable access to vaccination throughout the world because there is not adequate availability of vaccines. Thus, it is essential to maintain non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent transmission and reduce infections (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines). Actually, around the world, countries are still seeking to limit the impact of Covid-19 on health and society after more than 2 years of fighting SARS-CoV-2. To do this, governments are working as fast and fairly as possible to avoid new waves of the pandemic, minimize lives lost and maximize health, economic and social outcomes. Now, in 2022, we are more capable to identify new outbreaks early through timely and constant monitoring, to take appropriate measures to control the spreading of the virus (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/governments-approach-to-managing-local-coronavirus-outbreaks). We have a tool to control the virus, but large parts of the population for various reasons refuse to accept it. Countries have put in place legislative plans to address this issue. The concept, previously unknown, of a Covid Certificate has been introduced, in its various denominations and with the various peculiarities in different nations or geographical areas, showing also in this field differences at the international level [5].\n\nDespite the availability of a winning tool - vaccines - due to the problems mentioned above, non-pharmaceutical interventions remain essential. They must be combined with a very accurate contact tracing and mass vaccination campaigns to be extended to as many countries as possible.\n\nThrough our research, we seek to understand how different mitigation and containment strategies have been important in the past, focusing specifically on the investigation of the early stages of the pandemic, so that we can emphasize how key they are today and for the future at minimizing the risk of potential additional waves of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [6] in containing and mitigating contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus was assessed in this study [7]. Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of the containment measures adopted in order to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nNon-pharmaceutical public health measures and their effects on person-to-person transmission at the individual level (physical distancing, use of face masks, wearing of eye protection) have been studied by the Covid-19 Systematic Urgent Review Group Effort (SURGE). The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of one meter or more and highlight the importance of the use of masks, respirators and eye protection in order to avoid or minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants [8].\n\nStay-at-home orders, curfews and lockdown measures commonly occurred in countries with more than 10% daily increases in new cases [9] and the enforcement of strict physical distancing, along with robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine, contributed to keeping the disease at a level that did not exceed the capacity of a country’s health care system [10].\n\nHowever, policy responses to Covid-19 seem to remain complex, context-specific and are rapidly evolving as different countries pursue varying approaches to manage the pandemic. Analyzing these policies can help to understand and assess government preparedness, timing of reactions and resilience (https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker), [11].\n\nConsiderable efforts have gone into tracking health systems’ or governments’ responses to the pandemic, e.g., as part of the Covid-19 Health Systems Response Monitor. For example, Li et al. and Flaxman et al. conducted interesting comparisons of the approaches adopted by different countries in dealing with the pandemic [12]. In addition, previous research has shown that countries with less stringent lockdown measures have seen more pronounced surges (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).\n\nThis research aims to describe evidence on the effect of containment measures throughout the course of the pandemic in five European countries so far. “Containment measures” refer to the non-pharmaceutical and restrictive interventions. More specifically, the paper’s objectives included: 1) to compare the strength of containment measures adopted in the included countries; 2) to assess the timing of the introduction and relaxation of containment measures in relationship to the changes in the number of cases in these countries; and 3) to speculate about the effect the timing of relaxation measures had on the future course of the pandemic.\n\nWe chose France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom for our analysis because they were the first European countries to be hit by the pandemic (by end of February 2020, according to John Hopkins University information (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The results of this study may help decision makers better understand the effects of containment measures and the potential implications of lifting these measures too early. In fact, after studying the examples provided by the five countries and making statistical forecasts, we intend to provide a model that can help policy makers in making their important choices to address the current new waves of the pandemic and variants of the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThe approach adopted by this study consisted of three steps. First, we built a “Containment Index” (C.I.) which considers nine parameters selected in order to make assessments on the strength of restrictive measures adopted by the five included countries. Second, dynamic epidemiological models were developed for forecasting purposes. Third, predicted case numbers, assuming containment measures remain constant, were compared to observed numbers for a period of 30 days following the relaxation of containment measures in each country.\n\nMeasuring intervention with the containment index\n\nIn order to measure government reactions to the pandemic, we followed a similar approach as the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [13], but focused on containment measures only and tailored it to the countries in scope for our analysis (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK).\n\nWe identified a set of nine parameters C1, C2 ...C9 (only partially overlapping with OxCGRT), as described in Table 1, then scored and summarized them into a single summary index called “Containment Index” (C.I.).\n\nWeb research was conducted to collect the following information on governments’ responses in the five selected European countries: details of the actions they took, the start and end dates of those actions. Various bibliographic sources and reference sites were consulted for all countries analyzed in the study (https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-which-countries-are-under-lockdown-and-who-s-next), (https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse) to collect information on the restrictive measures respectively adopted in France (https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19), (https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/France-deconfinement-May-11-What-is-allowed-or-not-allowed-parks-beaches-schools-bars-restaurants-going-out-travel-transport), (https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11391728/coronavirus-france-lockdown/), (https://www.france24.com/en/20200622-back-to-school-for-millions-in-france-as-more-covid-19-restrictions-lifted), (https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/05/26/scho-m26.html), (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52615733), Germany (https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en), (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51999080), (https://kcrwberlin.com/2020/06/covid-19-in-berlin-and-germany-what-you-need-to-know/), (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Germany), (https://berlinspectator.com/2020/06/01/chronology-germany-and-the-coronavirus-3/), (https://www.euractiv.com/section/coronavirus/news/germany-extends-covid19-restrictions-but-announces-relaxation-of-some-measures/), (https://www.bavaria.by/information-coronavirus/), (https://www.thelocal.de/20200518/state-by-state-what-are-the-new-rules-for-eating-out-around-germany), (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/germans-urged-to-stay-home-amid-covid-19-infection-rate-fears), (https://www.dw.com/en/what-are-germanys-new-coronavirus-social-distancing-rules/a-52881742), Italy (http://www.governo.it/it/coronavirus-misure-del-governo), Spain (https://www.spainenglish.com/2020/05/31/lifting-lockdown-spain-full-details-phases/), (https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20200605/mapa-desescalada-espana-fase-esta-tu-provincia/2013477.shtml), (https://www.boe.es/biblioteca_juridica/codigos/codigo.php?id=363&modo=2&nota=0&tab=2) and in the UK (https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy), (https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/coronavirus-and-devolution), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools), (supplementary material S0).\n\nFor each parameter, responses have been scored according to the below schema (Table 2). Scores are scaled to the same range from 0 (no restrictions) to 1 (max containment) in order to make them comparable. For some measures it was not possible to define an intermediate grading and we described it in the table as ‘not assigned’.\n\nWe tracked the start and end dates for each progressive restriction and then, for the data analyses and representation, the temporal axis was converted from days to weeks (Mon. - Sun.), following the rule that, for a given parameter, a week is assigned the score that is valid for the most (≥ 4) days in the week. In our analyses we tracked and analyzed data from the week starting on February 24th, 2020, to the week starting June 1st, 2020.\n\nFinally, for each country/week, an overall Containment Index (C.I.) score was assigned. This is defined as the sum of the scores for the nine metrics, reflecting our assumption that each parameter evenly contributes to the overall index.\n\nModeling Covid-19 infection\n\nWe developed a Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator which allows for daily predictions of “total active cases” based on the level and trajectory of active cases by country, region or state (public data from national and regional health commissions for the five countries analyzed: France [14, 15], Germany [16], Italy (https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19), Spain [17, 18] and the UK [19, 20], (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/#category=nations&map=rate).\n\nThe Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator fits an upgraded version of the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) compartmental models to allow for parameter customization by country, region or state and introduces dynamic contact rates to better predict the peak time and general trend. SEIR [21,22,23,24,25,26] is a well-known class of models that is widely used for modeling epidemic evolution and generating related predictions. The SEIR model, its general parameters and the other parameters introduced to adjust the model to better fit different nations or regions are explained in detail in in supplementary materials (Supplementary material S1).\n\nThe input to the models were confirmed Covid-19 cases (per PCR testing) that have been progressively made available by national/regional health commissions [10, 27], (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-).\n\nIn some cases, public data have been amended and/or integrated after. This is not reflected in our analyses. In case of missing reported total cases for a few specific days, linear interpolation was applied.\n\nComparing the containment index across countries\n\nGiven the lack of an internationally accepted definition of terms, such as “lockdown” or “Phase Two”, we decided to define key milestones (and consequently phases) based on the evolution of the Containment Index over time to facilitate comparability across countries:\n\nTargeted period starts when the Containment Index becomes greater than 0 and if the first government measures are targeted to specific areas, regions or subsets of the population (called T0).\n\nLockdown starts when the Containment Index becomes greater than 7 (the countries during lockdown can reach the maximum value of Containment Index, which is 9) (called T1).\n\nPhase Two starts when, after the peak, the Containment Index becomes lower again or equal to 6 (called T2).\n\nSubsequently, analyses focused on comparing countries on a like-for-like basis, somewhat ignoring calendar time. Comparisons have been carried out in terms of descriptive analyses of the collected information (total cases and containment measures) as well as leveraging the predictions generated by the SEIR models implemented.\n\nFor each country, the Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator has provided daily forecasts for total cases up to a maximum of + 150 days. For example, on March 1st, the Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator generated predictions for total cases for March 2nd (+ 1 day) up to July 28th (+ 150 days) leveraging observed total cases up to March 1st; on March 2nd it generated predictions for March 3rd (+ 1 day) up to July 29th (+ 150 days) leveraging observed total cases up to March 2nd and so on. Day-after-day models progressively learn by incremental information made available which is reflected in more accurate predictions.\n\nIn the initial phase of the pandemic, one of the interesting objectives was to predict time to peak. But, as time passed, forecasts generated in previous months had been progressively overridden by actual data. Now, looking backward, we can leverage predictions made at specific points in time, compare different trajectories and correlate them to the different underlying restriction policies. In particular, based on predictions taken at Phase Two’s start (T2), we might speculate on what, under modelling assumptions, might have happened if lockdown restrictions continued for a longer time.\n\nFor such an exercise, we decided to focus on predictions at + 30 days. On one hand, we know that the accuracy of long-term predictions rapidly decreases given the extremely complex, fast-evolving factors that affect pandemic evolution (government restrictions as well as population compliance, mobility, individual behavior, social organization, climate, etc.). On the other hand, it is important to consider that potential effects of a containment measure might need approximately 14 days, according to the average duration for incubation based on clinical evidence and the recent studies confirming there is a lag for impacts of measures to be visible [28]. So, we need a forecast window reasonably greater than 2 weeks. Balancing the two considerations we chose a maximum timeframe of + 30 days.\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK applied restrictive measures to contain the pandemic, but the timing and effect on the national curves of the Covid-19 cases varied. The graphical representation of these results is available in supplementary materials (Supplementary material S2).\n\nInitial reactions\n\nItaly was the first western country to face the pandemic; the country had to react quickly and did not give up. During the week beginning on February 24th, some restrictive measures were applied only at a local level with a Containment Index of 4.5 (all confined locally to the so-called “red areas”). One week later, these measures were intensified and some of them were extended to the national level, while other restrictions were only adopted locally.\n\nIn Germany, the period of restricted measures that were partially applied at the regional level lasted for 4 weeks, twice as long as in Italy. It began, as in Italy, on February 24th, but in a very mild way, through the partial closure of schools and moreover only at a local level (C.I. = 0.25).\n\nIn Spain, the targeted local measures lasted only 1 week, starting on March 9th and concerned the partial local closure of some schools (C1 = 0.5).\n\nIn France, targeted restrictive measures were applied only on the first parameter: partial and local closure of schools from March 2nd to March 15th (C1 = 0.5).\n\nThe United Kingdom has having a particular attitude in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. Initially, they decided not to adopt any restrictive measures and recently as early as January 27, 2022 have lifted the requirement for masks and green passes. “In England, face coverings are no longer required by law. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet” (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own).\n\nCountry lockdowns\n\nOn March 9th, Italy was the first European country to enter a national lockdown and it lasted for 10 weeks, until May 3rd, with a C.I. = 9 and for the next 2 weeks until May 17th with a C.I. = 6.75.\n\nFrom March 16th to May 10th, France was in lockdown for 8 weeks (C.I. = 9).\n\nOn March 16th, also Spain entered lockdown for 9 weeks. We observed C.I. = 9 only for 3 weeks (from March 30th to April 19th), after which it progressively decreased. Starting on May 11th, the last week of lockdown, closures were regional for all the analyzed parameters, leading to an overall C.I. = 7.\n\nIn Germany, during the lockdown that started on March 23rd, the value of the C.I. varied from 7.25 in the first 4 weeks to 6.75 in the two remaining weeks of the entire period (6 weeks).\n\nOn the same day as Germany, the UK government decided to enter a national lockdown that lasted 10 weeks (one of the longest lockdowns among the countries analyzed). During the first 7 weeks, C.I. = 9 and then, from May 11th to May 31st, C.I. = 7.75\n\nEntering phase two\n\nThe first country to enter the Phase Two was Germany: beginning on May 4th, shops with less than 800 square meters and limited in-person shops could re-open, but with restrictions. From May 4th to May 18th, the C.I. was equal to 3.5. nationally then C.I. decreased to 3.25 on May 25th.\n\nAfter entering Phase Two on May 11th, France maintained an overall C.I. = 5 for the remaining duration of the analyzed period. It was possible to move within a maximum distance of 100 km and schools gradually reopened at the beginning of Phase Two but with some restrictions: e.g., middle schools remained closed in red zones and gradually reopened in departments only in green zones.\n\nOn May 18th, Phase Two began in Italy at the national level: the C.I. achieved during the first 2 weeks of this phase was 3.25 (schools continue to be closed and there was no longer the stay-at-home requirement). During the week beginning on June 1st, the C.I. lowered to 2.5 due to no more restrictions on domestic movement.\n\nOn the same day as in Italy, Spain entered Phase Two and the restrictive measures were relaxed at the regional level with a C.I. = 5.25. From May 25th to the end of our analysis period, Spain achieved a C.I. = 4.\n\nOn June 1st in the UK, there was a gradual relaxation of the restrictive measures and the country entered Phase Two, but the level of attention and alertness was kept high, as reflected by a C.I. = 6, with a partial opening of schools and restrictions on gatherings\n\nPredictions about lockdown end and phase two start: (T2) + 30 days\n\nThe predictions made with our forecasting model focused especially on Lockdown end and Phase Two start. T2 + 30 would have been June 3rd in Germany, June 10th in France, June 17th in Italy and Spain and July 1stin the UK.\n\nIn Fig. 2, we analyzed the total number of reported positive cases per 100,000 of population in the five countries (https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker), (https://www.spainenglish.com/2020/05/31/lifting-lockdown-spain-full-details-phases/), (https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20200605/mapa-desescalada-espana-fase-esta-tu-provincia/2013477.shtml), (https://www.boe.es/biblioteca_juridica/codigos/codigo.php?id=363&modo=2&nota=0&tab=2), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy), (https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/coronavirus-and-devolution), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools), [14,15,16, 27].\n\nConsidering the duration of the restrictive measures in the lockdown phase of the pandemic, Germany adopted the longest local (targeted) restrictive measures (4 weeks) and the shortest lockdown (6 weeks), which started later (when there were 35 cases per 100 K) compared to the other countries. Almost all the selected countries adopted restrictive measures for a period of 10 weeks while in Italy they took a period of 12 weeks (10 of which as lockdown). All the selected countries implemented a gradual closure of services and a progressive limitation of individual freedom except for the UK, since they didn’t adopt targeted measures.\n\nIn Fig. 3, we plotted the actual cases curve (continuous line) against predictions taken at T2 (dotted line) for each country (i.e., assuming lockdown containment measures were not eased). For instance, in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, predictions under the assumption of additional lockdown weeks would have led to significantly lower cases (− 4.9, − 3.3%, − 2.4%, and − 5.9%, respectively at T2 + 30 days). However, for Italy, the real cases curve is very close to the predicted cases (+ 0.5% at T2 + 30 days), indicating that, had they maintained restrictions, they would not have changed the evolution on the curve.\n\nIn addition, in Fig. 4 we have compared actual against predictions taken at T2 focusing on average new daily cases in the following 30 days. Here we can see that, according to predictions from our model, all countries except Italy might have benefited from a prolonged lockdown.\n\nTo face the Covid-19 pandemic, most European countries, and in particular those analyzed in this study (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK), have adopted diverse non-pharmaceutical and restrictive interventions ranging from case quarantine and isolation of contacts to the lockdown of entire populations. Assessing the impact of lockdowns and identifying the optimal strategies to manage the health crisis beyond lockdowns is of critical importance. To avoid the healthcare facilities overload, the severity of clinical cases and many deaths, it is has proved necessary to plan the response, adopting measures such as case finding, contact tracing, isolations and lockdowns of nations [29] and in parallel the large-scale vaccination campaign. Although these restrictive measures are crucial in minimizing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, the risk of pandemic resurgence when restrictions are relaxed and societies go back to a “business as usual” lifestyle has remained high. It is important to find a compromise between public health requirement and the economic and social needs of the population, analyzing the different restrictive measures in order to improve these measures aimed at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [10].\n\nThe Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) constantly collects information on measures taken by different governments to contain the effects of the pandemic and now has data from more than 180 countries. Surely this is an important tool for worldwide comparisons but, in our study, we thought it would be helpful to understand these comparisons across a limited number of European countries. As a result, we went for a tailored definition of all parameters for Containment Index definition.\n\nOther studies have addressed the topic of quantifying the effect of containment actions by looking at a rather high number of countries: Talic S et al. performed a meta-analysis to research the effect of handwashing, mask wearing and physical distancing measures on incidence of Covid-19. They concluded that these several personal and social protective measures are associated with decrease in virus circulation [30].\n\nIezadi S et al. in their meta-analysis showed that NPIs has determined a decrease in the COVID-19 reproduction number, daily case growth rates, daily death growth rates and COVID-19 daily ICU admission. It emerged that early enaction of lockdown, which predates the explosion in the number of positive cases, has been followed by a shorter duration of the lockdown itself and a smaller increase in the rate of case growth in the period after the application of this maximum containment measure [31].\n\nLi et al. conducted a modelling study across 131 countries [28] and Flaxman et al. studied the effect of major interventions across 11 European countries [12]. Conversely, our analyses aimed to describe, in a comparative way, different containment approaches implemented by the five countries and to qualitatively correlate them with the evolution of the pandemic. Our analyses were aimed at assessing whether mild measures or delays in adopting the different types of restrictive measures could have influenced the number of Covid-19 cases and the evolution of the epidemic curve, in order to be able to guide the near-future choices of governments, policy makers and health authorities in the best possible way. Consequently, based on the evolution of case numbers and the adopted restrictive measures in Europe, it is possible to make the following considerations.\n\nFollowing the diagnosis of the first patient affected by Covid-19 in Germany on January 27th, Germany implemented much milder and shorter restrictive measures in comparison to the other four countries. All restrictions were applied to every German state and were kept in place for a total of 6 weeks but there was never a total closure and, unlike the other European countries, Germany never issued a curfew. It should be noted that during the lockdown Germany never adopted the stay-at-home requirements in an absolute way (C8 = 0.5). Germany would have had a reduction of new cases from an extension of the lockdown and likely from the application of more restrictive measures as well, given the trend of the T2 + 30 curve in our predictive model (− 3.3%).\n\nAs early as January 30th, the Italian government ordered the blocking of air traffic from China, the first European government to do so. This was the beginning of the application of a long list of restrictive measures in Italy. After the first 2 weeks of targeted measures, Italy adopted one of the longest periods of lockdown (10 weeks, like in the UK) compared to the other selected countries. The adoption of such stringent measures has made a unique and indispensable contribution to the ongoing fight against the pandemic. In fact, as we observed in our predictive model, it seems that the relaxation of the restrictive measures was introduced at the right time because there would have been no net reduction of daily cases if the country would have entered Phase Two later (T2 + 30 = 0,5%). This shows a big difference between Italy and the other four countries analyzed in our study regarding the entry of the countries to Phase Two.\n\nAs France experienced the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a nationwide lockdown was implemented to curb the dramatic increase in the number of patients in critical conditions. The country is the only one to have maintained a total closure for all parameters (C.I. = 9) during the entire lockdown. However, this seems not to have been enough. In fact, considering our predictive model, France could have benefited from an extension of the lockdown duration, being able to obtain a further reduction in the number of new cases (T2 + 30 = − 4,9%).\n\nFollowing the story of Italy, Germany and France, Spain adopted a long lockdown (9 weeks) but maintained the maximum level of restriction for the shortest time (the maximum C.I. = 9 was true for only 3 weeks, compared to Germany where the maximum C.I. = 7.25 was held for 4 weeks). Spain is also the only country to have applied all restrictive measures at the targeted level before Phase Two (i.e., during the lockdown). Both these attitudes could justify the trend of the T2 + 30 curve of our preventive model (− 2,4%). The country probably should have applied more stringent restrictive measures and should have delayed the application of restrictive measures at the regional level, considering that Spain is the country that entered Phase Two with the highest number of cases per 100 K population (496 total cases per 100 K population) among the five countries analyzed.\n\nThe UK, despite not having gone through a targeted period, has applied very stringent restrictive measures during the lockdown and the country has very gradually entered Phase Two. The UK lockdown lasted for the same duration as the Italian lockdown, but the country started to adopt the first restrictive measures 4 weeks later than Italy did (March 23rd in the UK compared to February 24th in Italy). In our preventive model, the country would have benefited greatly (− 5.9%) from a delayed entry into Phase Two. This can be justified, as in France, by a consistent circulation of the virus that was difficult to control, already existing at the beginning of the adoption of the restrictive measures in the country. The UK has decided not to take some measures on a regional basis, as has been done by France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThe easing of the measures was carried out in a more or less gradual and cautious way by all five countries: for Phase Two, Germany had reported the lowest number of total cases per 100 K population among the five countries of the study, followed by France, Italy, the UK, and finally Spain (which loosened with the majority of cases). We can say that, compared to the other four countries analyzed, Germany was the first country to adopt a relaxation of restrictive measures: Germany began its first steps to ease restrictions on April 20th (during lockdown). Schools were reopened in Germany (C1 = 0.75), and approximately 25% of the students were allowed to go to school. Schools were soon opened in France (on May 11th) but there was a maximum number of 15 students for each classroom (C1 = 0.5). During Phase Two in Spain and Italy, schools continued to be closed. Particular attention should be paid to the fact that when Germany entered Phase Two, it had not imposed any restrictions on internal movement of citizens. Further, Italy was the only country that renounced the stay-at-home requirements immediately when it entered the Phase Two.\n\nConsistent evidence can be observed in our study and in others previously published on the impact of restrictions’ ease. In particular, our findings on restrictive measures’ effects are in line with the findings from Flaxman and colleagues [12] who assessed the impact of different NPIs among 11 European countries, but not their effects. Flaxman and colleagues reported clearly that several NPIs (e.g., school closure and public events ban) combined with lockdown had a large effect (81%) on reducing transmission. Our findings are also consistent with results from a 131 cross-country study by Li and colleagues [28]. They observed that individual NPIs are associated with a reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission and that the effect of introducing and lifting NPIs is delayed by 1–3 weeks, with a longer delay occurring when NPIs are lifted: a resurgence in Covid-19 cases has been reported in some countries that lifted some of these NPIs.\n\nBased on our observations, France and the UK had a small number of positive cases at the beginning of the pandemic and during lockdown, while Spain experienced high caseloads during the first wave of the pandemic and a constant increase of positive cases for SARS-CoV-2 during the second phase.\n\nFurther, looking at the evolution of the epidemic curves in the different countries, if we assume that lockdown containment measures were not eased (i.e., predictions until T2 + 30, the dotted line in the Fig. 3), we obtain interesting information when comparing countries. If the total blocking measures were prolonged, they would have led to a greater reduction of cases in the UK (− 5.9%), France (− 4.9%), Germany (− 3.3%) and Spain (− 2.4%), while Italy (+ 0.5%) would not have achieved substantial improvements (the zeroing target had already been achieved).\n\nWhen speculating about possible reasons for the different effects in easing lockdown measures, we mainly observed different behaviors related to school measures. Schools remained closed in Phase Two in Italy and in Spain while the other three countries gradually reopened (C1 was 0.75 at the beginning of Phase Two in France, in Germany and in the UK). In Germany, only the last year of each school level restarted (approximately 25% of students). In France, kindergarten and primary school children returned to school on a voluntary basis, middle schools were gradually reopened in the green zones while they remained closed in red zones. Like France, the UK began easing restrictions on schools starting with the opening of kindergarten and primary school.\n\nAs for other parameters such as businesses and workplaces, shops and retail, hospitality, personal care activities, assembly and leisure, internal movement, stay at home and gatherings, only Italy adopted targeted restrictions before the lockdown and Germany only had partially adopted restrictions for shops and retail, hospitality, assembly and leisure, and gatherings. In Italy, the early partial - and then total - restrictions concerning all the mentioned parameters can justify the good result reached by the predictive model T2 + 30. Furthermore, based on the number of Covid-19 cases, Germany was the first to introduce targeted measures (at 0.02 total cases per 100 K population) and Spain the last one (at 4,94 total cases per 100 K population). The UK entered lockdown with the same number of cases as France (10 total cases per 100 K population), but the UK started applying the restrictive measures a week later than France and without previous targeted measures reporting a number of Covid-19 cases almost double than France at the beginning of Phase Two (407 cases per 100 K in the UK vs. 214 cases per 100 K in France).\n\nThe results of our model speculate the evolution of the pandemic curve if the containment measures were prolonged and suggest that all the countries except Italy would have benefited from longer restrictions at the time of Phase One, although it was not possible to clearly quantify the contribution different behaviors had. Overall, we can say that there were three main factors that affected the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the above mentioned European countries: 1) the time when containment measures were adopted according to the epidemic curve (the earlier were the better); 2) the duration of containment measure adoption (2 weeks of early restrictive measures before the lockdown gave better results than no restrictive measures before the lockdown); 3) the number of Covid-19 cases before easing containment measures (the fewer the better before concluding the lockdown). We agree with Iezadi S et al. that the NPIs has had successful impacts on containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, despite the substantial impacts on economies and mental health. In addition to addressing issues regarding universal access to vaccines, considering the severe consequences of national lockdown and other restrictions, these interventions should be accompanied or mitigated by the adoption of other NPIs such as contact tracing, the use of face masks and suspected/patient case isolation strategies [31].\n\nGovernmental policies were found to play a crucial role in delaying the Covid-19 infection early spread [32] and the Case fatality rate, CFR [33]. From a detailed analysis regarding the introduction of some restrictive measures (nine analyzed parameters) in the five countries of our study (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK) and their subsequent lifting, their importance for the mitigation of the Covid-19 pandemic has emerged. In fact, the UK began to tackle SARS-CoV-2 with restrictive measures later than others and, despite having applied these measures for a long time, had greater difficulty in the fight against the virus. On the other hand, Italy, the first European country to be hit and to promptly implement the restrictive measures on all nine parameters analyzed, would not have benefited from a possible extension of the lockdown. In Germany, the restrictive measures were applied promptly but in a much milder way than in the other four countries; despite having the lowest number of cases (per 100 k population) when Phase Two started, the country would have possibly benefited from prolonged restrictive measures. France began rather promptly to adopt the restrictive measures against SARS-CoV-2 but the lockdown lasted only 8 weeks and the country would have benefited from a delayed entry into Phase Two. Spain applied restrictions limited to some regions during the lockdown. It was the country that entered Phase Two with the largest number of cases.\n\nReintroducing or easing restrictions are undoubtedly important decisions for governments because they have a relevant impact on the economy as well as on the psychological integrity and health of the population. For this reason, such decisions should be made by weighing many factors, including the epidemiological situation of the country, the capacity and resilience of the health system and the attitude and habits of the population. Our findings provide additional evidence that can inform policy makers’ decisions on introducing and relaxing of the different containment measures and their timing. Given the features of the Covid-19 pandemic, extensive case findings and isolations would be required to progressively lower the intensity of interventions and allow for the partial release of the socio-economic pressure and avoid the healthcare system exceeding saturation. We can only end the pandemic in one place by ending the pandemic everywhere. The entire world has the same goal: decrease Covid-19 cases. The SARS-CoV-2 countries’ response was very different: in some cases it was a failure, in others a success. Surely the most important lesson learned is that we can definitely defeat the invisible enemy and its emerging variants by improving our knowledge about the virus, its effects and how to contain both.\n\nLimitation of the study\n\nOverall, we acknowledge challenges and limitations regarding our analyses and interpretation of Covid-19 dynamics. First of all, in the initial phase of the pandemic, overall detection and reporting of positive cases was less accurate than in the following periods, causing models to learn from a likely underestimated total cases curve [34, 35]. Second, at the beginning, the number of tests (swabs) was insufficient, so a great majority of asymptomatic subjects were not tested. Third, we are aware that there might be gaps in the data used, in some specific days or due to country-specific reporting systems. In case of missing information, we replaced it with linear interpolation between adjacent observations. Fourth, as for the different containment actions, our scoring system considers the start and end dates as well as the level of restriction declared by each country according to our investigation. The level of compliance from population is not considered as it was not possible to properly measure it.\n\nWe acknowledge also limitations of the SEIR method used in our analysis: the removed subjects (R) are the recovered and dead cases that are assumed to be immune to the disease and would not be reintroduced to the susceptible (S). Model performances (and predictions generated) highly depend on accuracy, transparency, and promptness of data used as inputs. Related to this, in some cases, countries implemented changes in the reporting and testing approach, which would potentially affect the reported dynamics for case evolution. As for the model, as expected, accuracy of predictions decreases along time and models implemented in the Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator maximize short term (7-day) predictions. Also, it is important to underline that predictions at each step for each country are generated by the models under the assumptions that conditions are not varying. In our speculations, we have considered “what if” lockdown measure continued for some weeks more, but predictions cannot take into account additional external factors such as changes in populations’ behaviors (self-reducing contacts, limiting social activities, increased hygiene/disinfection in everyday life).'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00554-0', 'Headline': '‘COVID zero’ regions struggle with vaccine complacency - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Its ‘dynamic zero COVID-19’ policy is being put to the test as daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 climbed to 56,000 this week and deaths reached 246 on 1 March.', 'Full_text': 'NEWS\n\n04 March 2022\n\n‘COVID zero’ regions struggle with vaccine complacency\n\nSome places such as Hong Kong that excelled at keeping the coronavirus out are grappling with low vaccination uptake.\n\nBy\n\nAndrew Silver\n\nFor the handful of places around the world that effectively stopped COVID-19 transmission, vaccine complacency has become an unintended side effect of their success.

We’re tired of the pandemic, and ...', 'Full_text': 'Protests in multiple Chinese cities over the strict COVID-19 policies enforced by China’s government reflect the growing sentiment of people around the world. We’re tired of the pandemic, and tired of the myriad ways the SARS-CoV-2 virus has changed our lives forever. But the demonstrations in China also reflect a more specific, local frustration with a strategy for controlling the virus that every other country in the world has long since left behind.\n\nChina’s zero-COVID strategy is an extension of the drastic measures instituted, not only in that country but in others around the world, including the U.S., during the early days of the pandemic in an effort to quash the virus as quickly as possible. That made sense at the beginning when people had no immunity to the virus, and there were no vaccines or treatments to fight it. In fact, instituting lockdowns and keeping people from mingling are among the public health pillars of controlling an infectious disease. “Employing quarantine, isolation, and testing are all core public health strategies that we use in all sorts of outbreaks,” says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “And they remain viable. But they don’t always infringe on basic freedoms and rights in the same way we have seen in China. Clearly in this instance, they have become very extensive.”\n\nChina’s strategy has been to test people regularly before they leave their residences, or enter public facilities, and when anyone tests positive, to immediately quarantine the facility where the case arose, even if it means preventing people from returning home from work or from a daytrip Disneyland. From there, people who test positive are transferred to isolation facilities where they remain until they produce negative tests before they are allowed to return home.\n\nBut while chasing after the virus in this way can limit its spread, such stalking can only go so far. Ultimately, the virus escapes, and new infections are seeded. In SARS-CoV-2’s case, that likelihood is increased by the fact that the virus also lives in animal hosts where it continues to thrive, and mutate, waiting for opportunities to infect vulnerable human hosts with little defensive immunity against it. “It’s difficult to envision how a zero-COVID policy would eradicate this virus,” says Dr. Ian Lipkin, director of the center for infection and immunity at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. “Even if you exclude all human beings from being hosts, there are still animal reservoirs capable of carrying the virus, and reintroducing it into human populations.”\n\nWhile other countries, including Australia, the U.K., and the U.S. instituted a quarantine system similar to China’s in the early days of the pandemic, health officials there always acknowledged it would be a temporary solution, until the population’s immunity could be bolstered, both from exposure to natural infections and ultimately by vaccines.\n\nFor China, however, the strategy has been inflexible, and without a clearly defined exit strategy—largely because of how tightly intertwined it is with the authority and stature of the ruling Chinese Communist Party. “Politically, the pandemic response has been framed as a competition between two political systems, and Xi Jinping used China’s early success to showcase the superiority of the Chinese political system,” says Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, and professor of global governance and health issues in Asia at Seton Hall University. “”Theoretically, if they are able to sustain a low level of infection after other countries have moved away from zero COVID policies, they could claim they are the only winners in the fight. So the high political stakes also contributed to China keeping these policies.”\n\nMeanwhile, for the rest of the world, when effective vaccines became available at the end of 2020, a zero-tolerance strategy quickly became obsolete. As a population’s protection against the virus mounts due to immunizations, then confining infected people and trying to shut down large regions becomes no longer necessary. That’s the approach that Australia took, after a zero-COVID policy at the beginning of the pandemic. But, says Rivers, the difference was that Australia set a limit to the strict lockdowns, promising to lift them when 80% of the population had been vaccinated and therefore were better protected against severe disease. “There needs to be an exit strategy,” she says. “Australia clearly defined that strategy to keep the public on board and understand what the path forward was. It was also important to make sure the country didn’t get stuck in an unsustainable place.”\n\nChina may be in such a situation, with no clearly articulated end to its current policy.\n\nThe threats to global public health posed by China’s policy\n\nKeeping people isolated does give the virus fewer opportunities to spread and infect locally, but in a worldwide pandemic, that may not be the most desirable end result. People who are inadequately vaccinated, or who haven’t had much exposure to natural infection with the virus, fail to generate strong T-cell responses, which scientists believe is important for longer-lasting protection against serious COVID-19 disease. Much of the rest of the world has been building this T-cell defense, due to a combination of vaccination, boosting, and exposure to and infection with COVID-19. China’s population may still be in the nascent stages of amassing this type of protection. “Basically they have a population that is inadequately protected by either earlier infection or vaccination, who are now at risk for spread of the virus,” says Lipkin.\n\nContributing to that is the fact that studies show that the vaccines taken by the majority of China’s population, made in-country by two local companies, Sinovac and Sinopharm, haven’t provided as much protection against infection or severe disease as those produced in the U.S. and Europe. Those vaccines use inactivated forms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to stimulate the immune system, while other approaches have utilized new mRNA or viral vector technologies. That means that China’s population, although it may be immunized, may not be as protected as they could be. Indeed, Lipkin says that were China to deploy vaccines like the mRNA shot from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, or the viral vector vaccines from AstraZeneca, as booster shots, it could improve the protection begun by the inactivated virus vaccines the Chinese have used to date. Chinese scientists have been working on these other types of vaccines, including mRNA shots, but the health leadership has not yet endorsed these for widespread use in the country.\n\nThen there is the human and economic toll of quarantining people, cutting them off from and disrupting their social, professional, and cultural connections. The result has been that pent up frustrations have erupted into protests against not just the restrictive COVID-19 policies, but the entire communist system in recent weeks, in a stunning and rapidly spreading movement. “I think the Party was caught off guard when they were seeing protests in multiple cities,” says Huang.\n\nHow to take the next step forward\n\nHealth experts agree that the path out of zero-COVID is to accelerate vaccination of the population, which Chinese leadership has been attempting to execute in recent weeks. Party officials are fighting a problem of their own making, however, as many elderly members of the population have not been immunized because they don’t feel the urgency in a country where cases had been relatively low given the strict lockdowns. In a report released on Nov. 28, government health officials in China said 65.8% of people over age 80 years had received a booster dose. That’s an increase from the 40% reported in the middle of the month—but still far too low.\n\nEven if more people are boosted, given the waning protection provided by those shots, especially against newer Omicron variants, such boosters may not be enough to bolster the population’s immunity to levels that would justify phasing out the zero COVID policy. As long as the virus is able to produce more copies of itself, it will continue to evolve and generate new mutations, some of which could become variants that spread more quickly or cause more severe disease. The roulette wheel of viral mutations continues to spin, and the best defense to slow it down is through immunity—either from vaccinations or bouts of infections.\n\n“China has a population with very little infection-acquired immunity. And the vaccine acquired immunity has not held up well over time against new variants,” says Rivers. “So we expect a population that is largely susceptible. And those are conditions for large waves of infections. From a public health perspective, I would expect widespread vaccination and boosting of older people. But that is as much a political question as a public health one.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00484-6/fulltext', 'Headline': 'Estimating global, regional, and national daily and cumulative ...', 'Snippet': 'COVID-19 has already had a staggering impact on the world up to the beginning of the omicron (B.1.1.529) wave, with over 40% of the global population infected at least once by Nov 14, 2021.

Each country and city may have its own unique circumstances that require additional considerations and adaptations [1]. China has a population of 1.41 billion. Due to this huge population base, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a scientific, gradual, and cautious approach. Preparations for the epidemic and changes in the external environment have created conditions for the reopening [2], including the evolvement of the external environment, gradual formation of the COVID-19 immune barrier, the increased awareness of virus prevention, the advancement in COVID-19 treatment, lower virulence of the Omicron variant [3], and the decreased severe COVID-19 rate and mortality rate [4].\n\nExpansion of healthcare capacity\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the reopening policy, mainly in the following aspects: First, to prepare for potential risks of medical resource overloading associated with the reopening, in the past 3 years, the National Health Commission of China has taken measures to expand healthcare capacity and make progress in treating COVID-19. Common fever clinics have been opened and critical care beds have been expanded to alleviate medical overloading. Medical institutions across the country have strengthened their respiratory infectious disease prevention and control capabilities, with increased medical beds and equipment, as well as improved medical rescue abilities. Moreover, China’s medical grading diagnosis and treatment system plays an important role in meeting the needs of patients and effectively operating the primary medical system. Antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been included in medical insurance through fast-approval channels, and maximum efforts are being made to provide drugs to patients in need. The government and health departments at all levels are providing human, financial, and material support to primary medical institutions to help establish an effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment mode.\n\nDuring the reopening period, China focused on enhancing the ability to treat severe COVID-19 cases, improving the efficiency of transferring severe cases, and preventing mild cases from becoming severe. The collective efforts of the public governance system helped to meet medical needs and navigate the peak of infections.\n\nVaccination program\n\nSecond, SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China [5]. With the widespread promotion and the national free vaccination policy, by early November 2022, over 90% of the total population had completed the full course of the new coronavirus vaccine. Research conducted by the National Major Scientific and Technological Infrastructure for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center showed that among infected individuals aged 60 or older who received two to three doses of the inactivated coronavirus vaccine, the rate of severe illness protection reached 90.15% [6]. The rate of severe illness protection for all infected individuals was reported to be 96.02%. Data released by a research team from the University of Hong Kong also supported the efficacy of domestically produced inactivated vaccines in preventing severe illness and death [7].\n\nEpidemic prevention and control mechanism\n\nThird, over the past 3 years, China has improved its epidemic prevention and control mechanism for COVID-19. The “State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism” was established as a multidepartment coordination platform to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. Through this mechanism, many local outbreaks have been successfully controlled, and guidelines have been developed by the National Health Commission and experts in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, medical treatment, and public health policy. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infection” has been updated ten times to provide up-to-date strategies and recommendations.\n\nWeakened viral virulence\n\nLast but not the least, the variant of SARS-CoV‑2 is accompanied by variable characteristics of the clinical picture, with disease severity appearing to be lower with the Omicron variant [8]. Some scientists warned that this does not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed less virulence than previous variants of concern and lung function was less compromised [9]. There is growing evidence to suggest that, with the protection of vaccines and improved treatment conditions, the harm of COVID-19 to the population has significantly decreased over time [10].\n\nThese are just some of the prerequisites for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus is highly contagious, and the short-term surge in confirmed cases is an undoubtful challenge faced by medical institutions after the reopening. The 3‑year period of hard and effective epidemic prevention and control in China has won valuable time and experience for the comprehensive opening up of the country. It seems that the threat of the virus to the population has become more manageable; thus, ending the dynamic zero-COVID policy and reopening the country supports economic recovery and international cooperation. In 2022, Omicron became the dominant strain in China, with a weakened pathogenicity resulting in mostly mild symptoms and a small proportion of severe cases. With high vaccination rates and effective epidemic control measures, the focus shifted from “dynamic clearance” to “protecting vulnerable populations.” On January 7, 2023, the State Council issued the 10th edition of the prevention and control plan, which emphasized vaccination and personal protection, optimized testing strategies, and outlined emergency measures during the epidemic.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/', 'Headline': ""What is China's zero-COVID policy and how does it work?"", 'Snippet': 'Nearly three years into the pandemic, China is sticking with a strict COVID-19 containment policy that has caused mounting economic damage and widespread frustration, while keeping its borders ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/world/asia/china-zero-covid-explainer.html', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-Covid Approach Explained - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'China’s “dynamic zero-Covid” policy was born out of the effort to control the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan.

But China, where it first appeared in late 2019, remains intent on eradicating the virus, carrying out extensive lockdowns and testing wherever new cases arise.\n\nThe country’s “zero-Covid” policy has been a drag on China’s economy, travel and everyday life. In some cases, lockdowns have led to widespread shortages of food and other daily necessities, such as in the northwestern city of Yining, also known as Ghulja. There, residents under lockdown for more than a month have complained about being forced to go hungry or endure woeful conditions in quarantine camps.\n\nSuch disruptions have spurred debate on whether “zero Covid” remains the best course for managing the risks posed by the pandemic.

Here are the key highlights for income distribution by age:\n\nIn terms of income distribution across age cohorts, in Illinois, householders within the 45 to 64 years age group have the highest median household income at $92,666, followed by those in the 25 to 44 years age group with an income of $86,623. Meanwhile householders within the 65 years and over age group report the second lowest median household income of $55,071. Notably, householders within the under 25 years age group, had the lowest median household income at $39,545.\n\nNotably, household income for individuals within the Under 25 years age group demonstrated a remarkable increase of $11,031(38.69%), escalating from a median of $28,514 in 2012 to $39,545 in 2022.\n\n202,133(4%) households where the householder is under 25 years old.\n\n1,674,567(33.12%) households with a householder aged between 25 and 44 years.\n\n1,816,796(35.93%) households with a householder aged between 45 and 64 years.\n\n1,362,864(26.95%) households where the householder is over 65 years old.\n\nRead more about Illinois median household income by age ➔\n\nGender\n\nIn Illinois, the population consists of 6.33 million males (49.39%) and 6.49 million females (50.61%). Here are the primary highlights from the gender-based income distribution analysis:\n\nIn Illinois, the median income for all workers aged 15 years and older, regardless of work hours, was $48,807 for males and $32,877 for females.\n\nHowever, when specifically considering full-time, year-round workers within the same age group, the median income was $67,800 for males and $54,544 for females.\n\nIn Illinois, the median income for all workers aged 15 years and older, regardless of work hours, was $48,807 for males and $32,877 for females.\n\nIn Illinois, among full-time, year-round workers aged 15 years and older, males earned a median income of $67,800, while females earned $54,544, leading to a 20% gender pay gap among full-time workers. This illustrates that women earn 80 cents for each dollar earned by men in full-time roles. This analysis indicates a widening gender pay gap, showing a substantial income disparity where women, despite working full-time, face a more significant wage discrepancy compared to men in the same roles.\n\nRead more about Illinois income by gender ➔\n\nRace\n\nIn Illinois, the population is predominantly White, constituting 67.85% of the total residents. Here are the key highlights from the analysis of income distribution by race:\n\nThe median household income for White households is $83,346.\n\nIn Illinois, despite the White population being the most populous, it is worth noting that Asian households actually reports the highest median household income, with a median income of $104,287. This reveals that, while Whites may be the most numerous in Illinois, Asian households experience greater economic prosperity in terms of median household income.\n\nIn Illinois, the median household income for the households where the householder is White increased by $6,059(7.84%), between 2012 and 2022. The median household income, in 2022 inflation-adjusted dollars, was $77,287 in 2012 and $83,346 in 2022.\n\nIn Illinois, the median household income for the households where the householder is Black or African American increased by $3,918(9.53%), between 2012 and 2022.

Similarly the most substantial year-by-year decline occured from 2010 to 2011, when the median household income decreased by 1,225 (from $75,202 to $73,977).\n\nIt then further increased to $115,980 for 7-person households, the largest household size for which the bureau reported a median household income.\n\nWith a Gini coefficient of 0.4837, it is evident that income distribution in Illinois exihibits characterstics of moderate inequality .\n\nFor the family households, the median income (in 2022 inflation-adjusted dollars) was $96,948.

Census data are particularly helpful, as they allow us to track and measure progress in the key areas of economic security, education, and health.

This week, new data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population and American Community Surveys (ACS) reveal the benefits of federal and state relief and investments for children and families in 2021.This post provides a general overview of the state-level 2021 ACS data release, reviewing information about household income, poverty, and health coverage. This data release provides updated information to YWCA’s 2022 Illinois KIDS COUNT policy brief, which provides more comprehensive information on the state of child well-being in Illinois and policy solutions for an equitable recovery.Data Release HighlightsACS state-level data illustrate how Illinoisans fared in 2021. On average, Illinois children and families experienced better outcomes than the national averages in median income, poverty, and health insurance coverage. Based on the data released today, these key areas were greatly impacted by federal and state COVID relief last year. From 2019 to 2021, our state’s median income only decreased, our poverty rates increased by less than 1%, and our uninsured rates decreased by thousands.Median Household IncomeMedian household income data give insight into the amount and distribution of income among households in a specific geography. In Illinois, the median household income was $72,205. In 2019 before the pandemic, the median household income was $69,187. When we take inflation into account, the median income has decreased by over $1,000 from 2021 to 2019. This indicates a reduction in household incomes across our state, but some households have experienced more decreases than others. Households headed by women and households of color earn less over their lifetime. These disparities are due to systemic racism that results in inequities in accessing education and employment for women and people of color. The wage gap for women working full time, year-round has continued with men ($65,834) earning $13,711 more than women ($52,123). For households of color, the wage gap was even larger. Black households earned the least of all households, $42,118, which was $30,000 less than the Illinois median household income. These disparities make it clear that centering gender and racial equity in policies that boost household income can help alleviate inequities.PovertyThe poverty rate is determined by a household’s income. If a family or individual’s income is below the Federal poverty threshold, they are considered poor. For 2021, the official poverty threshold was $27,479 for a family of four. ACS data show that, relative to 2019, Illinois households experienced a 0.6% percent increase in poverty with almost 1.5 million (12.1%) of residents living in poverty. Disparities in racial/ethnic identity become apparent when we disaggregate the data. People of color experience higher poverty rates in Illinois. And Black Illinoisans face a poverty rate two times higher than residents of other racial/ethnic identities. Compared to 2019, Illinois children experienced a 0.3% percent increase in poverty, with over 442,000 (16%) children living in poverty in 2021. When we disaggregate the data by racial/ethnic identity, it becomes clear that children of color are experiencing higher rates of poverty. Both Black and Latinx children in Illinois were more likely to experience poverty compared to other children. Growing up in poverty can have developmental consequences for children. Moreover, children can experience worse economic, health, and educational outcomes in the future. To address these challenges, anti-poverty solutions that increase financial security are critical to meeting basic needs and improving resources for children across the state.Health Coverage During a global pandemic, 875,000 (7.0%) Illinoisans were uninsured in 2021. This was 48,000 fewer Illinoisans uninsured than before the pandemic. The Illinois’ uninsured rate was lower than the national uninsured rate (8.6%). From 2013 to 2016, Illinois’ uninsured rates improved, but rates started reversing from 2017 to 2019. These increases in the number and percentage of uninsured among all Illinoisans and children was a concerning trend. Fortunately, these 2021 data demonstrate the pandemic-era health policies protected more Illinois residents from health emergencies and excessive health care costs. In terms of types of insurance, rates of Illinoisans with Employer-based and Medicare coverage stayed similar, while direct-purchase insurance (e.g., Affordable Care Act) and public insurance (e.g., Medicaid) increased from 2019 to 2021. Given the importance of health insurance coverage for both physical and mental health, Illinois must expand coverage to more adults--especially undocumented adults--and outreach to families regarding All Kids enrollment. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of federal and state actions that protected many Illinois families from severe hardships. Unfortunately, any improvements in income, poverty, and health coverage will disappear in the coming years absent long-term state and federal investments in anti-poverty tools like the child tax credit; food and rental assistance; and more accessible health coverage.

Nearly 240,000 of them are considered to live in “deep poverty,” which is incomes of less than one-half of the poverty line.\n\nThe Chicago households most commonly in deep poverty are single-mother families, with nearly 101,000 individuals.\n\nOf the city’s mom-led households, 17.7% lived in deep poverty. Married couple families faced deep poverty rates of only 2.6%. Families in “other” living arrangements – such as single fathers and their children or households where children are being raised by someone other than their parents – also face substantially lower deep poverty rates at 12.2%.\n\nTo be considered in “deep poverty,” a household of two had to earn less than $12.54 per person per day. For single mothers with multiple children, the figure was even less.\n\nExtremely high levels of poverty among single mothers is part of the reason why women in Chicago are 21% more likely to be impoverished than men. Poverty is also more common among women in Chicago than in other large cities throughout the country.\n\nThese differences are likely attributable to discrepancies in labor force participation between men and women, which differ even more dramatically among mothers and fathers. Lower labor force participation among mothers is concerning, as data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows employment status is the single-most important factor impacting the poverty rate. Full-time employees in Chicago not only face lower poverty rates than Americans in other large cities, but securing full-time, year-round employment virtually eliminates the odds of being in poverty.\n\nFortunately, research has shown that public policy can positively influence employment, particularly among single mothers, while evidence also suggests anti-poverty programs that incentivize work have been effective in increasing employment and raising incomes to promote upward mobility.\n\nFuture poverty alleviation solutions should focus on ways to encourage labor force participation and secure better employment outcomes for capable individuals. Reducing barriers to entry into the labor force, removing cumbersome regulations, improving the quality of education and fostering an environment in which employees, employers and communities can flourish all present opportunities for public policy solutions that can reduce poverty and improve the lives of Chicagoans – regardless of their income status.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2022/demo/families/cps-2022.html', 'Headline': 'America’s Families and Living Arrangements: 2022 - Census.gov', 'Snippet': 'These tables show the number and type of family households in the United States.

(Only parents with children under age 18 were included in this study.)\n\nAmong parents with middle and upper incomes, mental health concerns top the list of parental worries, followed by concerns about bullying. About four-in-ten middle-income parents (38%) and 32% of those with upper incomes say they are extremely or very worried that their children might struggle with anxiety or depression at some point. A third of middle-income parents and about a quarter (24%) of those with upper incomes are similarly concerned about their children being bullied, while considerably smaller shares say they are extremely or very concerned about the other items on this list.\n\nAmong lower-income parents, mental health and bullying are also top concerns, with roughly half saying they are extremely or very concerned about their children struggling with anxiety or depression or being bullied (48% each).

In contrast, those with upper incomes are more likely to say they are raising their children in a similar way to how they were raised (51%) than to say they’re raising them differently (41%).

While more parents across income groups say they tend to be overprotective rather than give their children too much freedom, those with lower (50%) and middle (45%) incomes are more likely than those with upper incomes (40%) to describe themselves as overprotective.\n\nIn turn, upper-income parents are more likely than those with middle and lower incomes to say they tend to push their children too hard rather than not hard enough and to offer too much criticism rather than too much praise, although majorities or pluralities across income groups say none of these describes their parenting style. About a third of upper-income parents (32%) say they push their children too hard, compared with 26% of middle-income and 20% of lower-income parents.

The pandemic was particularly debilitating for single-parent households—especially those headed by women, who still bear the brunt of domestic work.\n\nSingle-parent households already dealt with disproportionately high economic precarity compared to dual-parent households and other family structures prior to the pandemic. Between frequently relying on a single income, the expense of childcare, and a lack of robust resources available to help and protect single parents, these households experienced higher levels of economic insecurity than others. However, the onset of the pandemic widened existing disparities partially because of the concentrated effects of school and childcare closures.\n\nRELATED: Best Counties to Raise a Family in Illinois\n\nAs of 2019, the U.S. had the highest percentage of single-parent households in the world, with millions of solo guardians struggling to make ends meet on one income while performing all the labor of parenting day in and day out. Single parents are often faced with difficult or even impossible choices: whether to pay rent or buy food and whether to go to work or take care of a child.\n\nThe problem is even worse for single parents working low wage jobs, 93% of whom had no access to paid family and medical leave as of 2018. (As of 2022, 60% of the lowest 10% of all wage workers cannot earn paid sick days, compared to just 4% of the highest 10% of earners.)\n\nTo determine the states with the most single-parent households, Stacker used data from the U.S. Census American Community Survey 2021 five-year estimates. The survey data was collected in 2021 and released in 2022.\n\nAll 50 states and Washington D.C. are ranked here according to the share of households that have single parents, classified as either “Male householder, no wife present, children of the householder under 18 years” or “Female householder, no husband present, children of the householder under 18 years.” Census categories currently fail to capture the full scope of potential LGBTQ+ family relationships and identities. Along with each state, information about the breakdown of single parents, as well as the total number of married couples with kids, is provided.\n\nContinue reading to find out more about the states with the most single-parent households.\n\n51.

Now that would be an interesting question to ask,” Maisch told The Center Square. “In terms of median income going down, you never want to see that, clearly, there has been a slowdown in the economy.”\n\nThe 2021 median household income in Illinois was just above $72,000, from data provided by the Census Bureau.\n\n“Keep in mind some people have just decided to check out of the workforce for an extended period of time and live off savings or you know, move back in with their parents,” Maisch said. “They enjoy the freedom and the ability to enjoy some time without having to earn a paycheck necessarily.”'}}",96.25,3

That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas. He must reportedly surrender on or after Jan. 5, 2024.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ashli-babbitt-mother-hanging-pelosi-b2404673.html', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt’s mother makes death threat against officer who shot ...', 'Snippet': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6 riot, has called for the Capitol Police officer who shot her daughter to be hanged — along with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ...', 'Full_text': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6 riot, has called for the Capitol Police officer who shot her daughter to be hanged — along with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nMicki Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, said to a crowd of people, reportedly outside of the DC jail: “The Capitol Police needs to be abolished, or at the very least investigated.”\n\nShe continued, “Michael Byrd needs to swing from the end of a rope, along with Nancy Pelosi.” Ms Pelosi was serving as Speaker of the House on January 6, 2021.\n\nMs Witthoeft has in the past posted a photo of Michael Byrd on X, formerly known as Twitter, writing, “Today is July 1, 2022 and Michael Byrd is still a murderer profiting from my daughter’s death.”\n\nThe Justice Department announced in April 2021 that it would “not pursue criminal charges against” Mr Byrd, as its investigation “revealed no evidence to establish that, at the time the officer fired a single shot at Ms. Babbitt, the officer did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to do so in self-defense or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber.”\n\nStill, Babbitt’s mother has remained steadfast in her views.\n\nIn May, Ms Witthoeft was arrested and charged with simple assault — after pushing a counter-protester at a right-wing event outside a Washington DC jail — and destruction of property.\n\nShe was previously arrested in January this year in Washington DC while protesting on the second anniversary of the Capitol attack after a group of protesters, who didn’t have a permit to demonstrate on the Capitol grounds, tried to cross a street and enter the grounds.\n\nMs Witthoeft was arrested on two infractions: disobeying an order and blocking or obstructing a roadway.

In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected].\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://reason.com/2022/01/04/ashli-babbitts-violent-past-doesnt-justify-her-death/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's Violent Past Doesn't Justify Her Death - Reason.com"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt\'s Violent Past Doesn\'t Justify Her Death.

In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-manufactured-martyr-ashli-babbitt-191518760.html', 'Headline': 'Trump’s ‘manufactured martyr’: How Ashli Babbitt’s death was weaponised ...', 'Snippet': 'Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating ...', 'Full_text': '“Every time he talks about her, he says her name. He could say ‘her’ or ‘she; or whatever.

She was part of a crowd of Trump supporters that had stormed the seat of the US Senate to stop it ratifying the election result, with some allegedly planning to do so by armed force.\n\nIn a less polarised era, American politicians in both parties might have rallied around the officer who shot her. Today, though, she has become a martyr to many of Mr Trump’s followers, praised and venerated by a movement that is increasingly willing to endorse political violence to keep its opponents out of power.\n\nRepublican members of congress including Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Matt Gaetz of Florida have taken up her cause, as have Fox News, the pro-Trump TV station Newsmax and even Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne right-wing group, Look Ahead America, has called for a vigil in Babbitt’s name for those in prison awaiting trial for their alleged actions on 6 January. Donations to a ""Justice for Ashli Babbitt legal fund"" continue to pour in, with more than $378,000 (£278,500) raised as of Wednesday.\n\nFollow live updates on the January 6 anniversary\n\nMr Trump himself has been her cheerleader in chief, referring to her death as a murder. and offering her family his ""unwavering"" support"". ""To Ashli’s family and friends, please know that her memory will live on in our hearts for all time,"" he said in a video specially filmed for her birthday on 10 October. ""There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli.""\n\nTerrorism experts and anti-racist groups find the former president’s intervention deeply disturbing, comparing it to the way Islamic fundamentalists and the Nazi Party in the 1940s used manufactured martyrs to inspire further acts of violence.\n\nFor Cara Castronuova, a pro-Trump activist who co-founded the group Citizens Against Political Persecution to advocate for alleged January 6 rioters, it is a vindication of many months fighting to reframe the storming of the Capitol as a peaceful protest and its alleged invaders as political prisoners.\n\n""At first her name was taboo, even in conservative media,"" Ms Castronuova tells The Independent. ""Nobody would talk about her, nobody would mention her, nobody would mention anybody’s name from 6 January. There was a three to four month block of time at the beginning of 2020... and then it just snowballed.""\n\nWho was Ashli Babbitt?\n\nWhen Ashli Babbitt quit the US military in 2016, she left at the rank of senior airman with 12 years of service and eight deployments behind her. Having enlisted in the US Air Force (USAF) straight out of high school in 2003, she protected bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, protected USAF bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Katar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAt one point, she had even guarded the seat of the US government, serving in an Air National Guard unit known as the ""Capital Guardians"" at a base near Washington DC. In 2013, she was part of the DC Air National Guard’s security detail for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nBabbitt grew up in Lakeside, California, not far from San Diego, the oldest sister to four younger brothers. One former classmate told Insider that she was ""disruptive"" in class, highly opinionated and always trying to be ""one of the guys"".\n\nThat bolshy nature survived throughout her service, with former comrades saying she struggled to be promoted and was demoted at least once due to spats with superiors. One friend described her as ""small but mighty"" (Babbitt was 5 feet 2 inches tall), unafraid to contradict her officers when she disagreed.\n\n""Ashli was headstrong and impulsive,"" said Sgt Eirik Blackwolf, who served with her in the DC Air National Guard. ""She didn’t hold back on her opinion to anyone, no matter their rank, especially if she thought they were wrong or behaving unethically.""\n\nDuring one deployment Babbitt was injured in a mortar strike that knocked her onto a pile of debris. Augustine Luna, a close friend, told Insider that the impact damaged Babbitt’s uterus and left her unable to bear children, but that Babbitt rarely mentioned this.\n\nIn 2015 Babbitt began working as a private security guard for a nuclear power plant in Maryland, where she met her future second husband Aaron Babbitt. That was also the year Mr Babbitt’s then-girlfriend Celeste Norris first encountered Ashli.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ms Norris said Mr Babbitt at first described the new girl as ""this foul-mouthed chick that’s on shift"". Later, Ms Norris found out the two were dating, and broke up with Mr Babbitt.\n\nThe next year, Ms Norris said, she was waiting at a stop sign when a white SUV barged through nearby traffic and repeatedly rammed into her car. When they stopped, Babbitt got out and began hammering with her hand on the window. ""It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was,"" said Ms Norris. ""Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.""\n\nA court acquitted Babbitt of criminal charges, but Ms Norris secured a restraining order against her, and later mounted a personal injury lawsuit that Babbitt settled out of court. In court documents from 2017, Ms Norris wrote that Babbitt had continued to follow her home from work and harass her. ""I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,"" she told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Babbitt moved to San Diego to help buy out and run a swimming pool supply company where her brothers, her uncle and her husband all worked together. ""It was kind of nice, a family affair,"" her brother Roger said.\n\nBabbitt and her husband became daily customers at a brewery near the San Diego sea front, often with their three ex-military dogs in tow. According to brewery owner Jim Millea, the pair had a polyamorous relationship with one of his bartenders. Babbitt herself often arrived fuming about a political issue that had grabbed her attention.\n\nYet the pool supply business quickly got into trouble. Babbitt took out a short term business loan with a steep interest rate and was sued by the lender for failing to make payments, ultimately being ordered by a judge to pay it all back. In 2019, she sold the house where her parents had lived for nearly 20 years, reportedly making them feel ""kicked out of their own home"".\n\nBy this time, Babbitt was a staunch Trump supporter and an opponent of lockdown measures. Her company’s office bore a sign reading: ""Mask-free autonomous zone, better known As America"".\n\nHer brother told the New York Times that she had felt free after leaving the military, and had been angry with the number of homeless people in San Diego and the challenges for small business owners.\n\nOne customer told CBS 8 San Diego that he dropped Babbitt’s company after she went on an unprovoked political rant. “She just started talking about people who oppose Trump and about Nancy Pelosi and [Chuck] Schumer and homeless people,"" the customer said. ""A lot of it didn’t even make any sense. It literally went on for about a minute and a half... it was shocking that she would be talking to a customer the way she was talking to me.""\n\nEven so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents. ""I don’t really know why she decided to do this,"" her mother-in-law toldFox 5 Washington DC last year.\n\nHer social media accounts, however, told an all too familiar story.\n\n‘Nothing will stop us’\n\nOn 7 September, 2020, tweeting under the username @CommonSenseAsh, Ashli Babbitt posted a photo of herself smiling in sunglasses and a black tank top, posing in front of an old-fashioned boat in the harbour of San Diego.\n\nTo many the photo might have looked innocuous, a happy selfie from a nice day out. But her shirt bore the slogan ""We are Q"" – a reference to the anonymous purported government insider who inspired the cult-like millenarian movement known as QAnon.\n\nFor almost a year, Babbitt had been posting in support of QAnon, which believes Mr Trump’s Democratic opponents are part of a global Satanist paedophile ring. Adherents think Mr Trump himself is the figurehead for a secret plot by ""white hats"" (ie, good guys) to sweep the Satanists from power in a military coup, resulting in mass imprisonment or execution.\n\nThe movement has been tied to violent acts including murders, kidnappings, terror plots, attempted bombings, and vehicular attacks, as well as campaigns of online harassment and death threats.\n\nBabbitt’s radical shift came gradually. Back in 2018, she had told another user that she had voted for Barack Obama and still believed he had done ""great things"", but had turned to Mr Trump because she could not stomach Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Ms Luna, Babbitt had voted for Trump in 2016 because he was not a career politician, but soon began calling Democrats ""commies"" and skirmished aggressively offline and online with anyone who disputed her anti-mask beliefs.\n\nIn November 2019, she tweeted about Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that went viral among Trump supporters in 2016 and was a key precursor to QAnon. Online activists had fixated on chance words in hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders as evidence of a secret child sex dungeon beneath a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. Later one of them stormed the restaurant with a rifle to rescue the supposed children, but found nothing.\n\nIn February 2020, Babbitt tweeted her first of many QAnon slogans. Most often she retweeted QAnon influencers such as the lawyer Lin Wood. Ms Luna told Insider that Babbitt was drawn in by the idea that children were in danger, spending hours every week reading about missing kids and appalled that QAnon’s claims were not being taken seriously in the mainstream media.\n\nAccording to Prof Mia Bloom, a terrorism researcher at Georgia University, QAnon’s appeals to ""save the children"" are ""almost verbatim"" how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) recruited three British schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, London, in 2015.\n\n""This kind of message that builds upon someone’s innate goodness is a very different pathway into terrorism than we ordinarily think,"" says Prof Bloom. ""We assume that it’s about hatred, it’s about violence, it’s about racism and white supremacy on the Right and jihadi ideology for [Islamic] groups, when in fact a lot of the pull factors can be based in what we would consider to be very positive attributes.""\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Babbitt did not accept the results of the 2020 election and plunged wholeheartedly into the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. On 1 January, 2021, Babbitt tweeted that she would be in Washington DC on the 6th for a rally addressed by Mr Trump.\n\nOn 5 January, she boarded a plane in San Diego and texted to her friend that there were ""tons of Trump supporters"" flying with her. Another user tweeted that some flights to DC were being cancelled, supposedly to prevent people from attending the 6 January rally.\n\nBabbitt replied: ""Nothing will stop us. They can try and try and try, but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.""\n\nWhen Trump’s army stormed the Capitol, Ashli Babbitt was among the mob that gathered in a stairwell near the chamber of the House of Representatives, where up to 80 members of congress and staff were sheltering. She was wearing a Trump flag on her shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe crowd began hammering on the doors out of the stairwell, which were barricaded from the other side with furniture. One window broke, and Ashli Babbitt, who was unarmed, climbed through. A gunshot rang out, and she fell back with a bullet in her shoulder.\n\nPro-Trump activists have found their George Floyd\n\nLast August, the police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt finally broke his silence. For months Lt Michael Byrd, who is black, had been in hiding due to repeated death threats and racist attacks after Mr Trump falsely claimed he worked for a ""high-ranking"" Democratic politician.\n\n""I know that day I saved countless lives,"" Lt Byrd told NBC News. “I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nBabbitt did not become a Trumpist hero overnight. The day after the riot, Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin, who saw Babbitt’s death, said that Lt Byrd had not had any choice. ""The mob was going to come through the door,"" he told ABC. ""There was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many Trump supporters believed she was a plant or a stooge, put into the crowd by the FBI or other dark forces. In April, the US Department of Justice closed its investigation with no criminal charges.\n\nBy the time of Lt Byrd’s interview, however, Babbitt’s name had become a clarion call in what Ms Castronuova calls the conservative ""underground"" of alternative media and social media. Ms Castronuova was among the first people to interview Babbitt’s family on InfoWars, a fringe news site that often promotes conspiracy theories and has been banned from most major social networks for hate speech.\n\n""[Trump] is really in tune with the community, his base,"" Ms Castronuova says. ""The underground will start to buzz, then Donald Trump picks up on it."" Soon enough, at rallies and in interviews last summer, Mr Trump was calling Babbitt ""an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman"", someone who was on his ""side"", and said there was ""no reason for"" her to die. Ms Castronuova says his backing was ""instrumental"".\n\nMr Trump’s efforts increased after a personal phone call to Mrs Witthoeft, who had become politically active. She has now spoken at a Trump rally and has backed her daughter’s actions, saying: ""She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.""\n\nMs Castronuova says: ""[Babbitt’s] mother has been really instrumental too. She became quite an advocate. She was afraid to speak out at first... but when she finally started speaking out, things really started to change.""\n\nBabbitt’s family sued the District of Columbia to uncover Lt Byrd’s identity, and plans to file wrongful death lawsuits against Lt Byrd himself and the Capitol Police. Terrell Roberts III, a lawyer for Babbitt’s husband Aaron, declined to comment and declined an interview on Mr Babbitt’s behalf.\n\nDonations to Mr Babbitt’s legal fund continue to roll in, with many donors identifying themselves as military veterans. Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating Democratic secrets.\n\nMany Trump supporters have compared Babbitt to George Floyd, a black man murdered by police in Minnesota, lifting the Black Lives Matter slogan ""say her name"" used in reference to many victims of police brutality.\n\nOn the private messaging app Telegram, which is popular on the far right, pro-Trump channels frequently invoke Babbitt’s name, sharing news articles about her family’s lawsuit or claiming that she was set up by informants. Many asked the question ""who killed Ashli Babbit?"" which Mr Trump later echoed.\n\n""The entire scenario looks to be staged. So who is the rotting fish head of what appears to be a deliberate false flag? Who or what group set this up?"" said the evangelist channel Veteran Patriots. The Proud Boys, a fascist militia, have begun using a stylised image of Babbitt as a logo, with the slogan: ""They can’t kill us all.""\n\nBritish radicals have also taken up her cause. ""Her name was Ashli Babbitt,"" said British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. ""She was murdered by the state and her name was dragged through the mud by the media."" An account identifying itself as former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has invoked her name several times.\n\nSome appear to believe she is not even dead. ""Ashli Babbitt false [is a] flag, she’s alive living underground,"" said a QAnon channel called Gitmo TV.\n\n‘A weapon of mass radicalisation’\n\nTo Prof Bloom, Babbitt’s transformation into an innocent victim of Leftist injustice has a worrying historical echo: Horst Wessel, the young Nazi street-fighter who was turned into a symbol of fascist heroism by Josef Goebbel’s propaganda apparatus.\n\nWessel was shot in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party, probably as part of a dispute over unpaid rent with his Communist landlady. By 1936, after the Nazis took power, official media referred to him as greater than Jesus Christ and the Horst Wessel Song was Germany’s joint national anthem.\n\n""Fake martyrdoms succeed because they feed off the shared grievances and anger of the crowd, serving as justification for future retaliatory violence,"" wrote Prof Bloom and another researcher, Sophia Moskalenko, with whom Prof Bloom has co-authored a book about QAnon. ""Ashli Babbitt’s unfortunate death is a weapon of mass radicalisation, just like Horst Wessel’s death was manipulated by Goebbels.""\n\nIndeed, the Nazis’ modern successors have particularly embraced Babbitt, turning an enthusiastic Trump supporter with a chequered past who was killed in a chaotic riot into a towering hero or innocent victim of police brutality while seeking to pin the blame on black and Jewish people.\n\n""Unlike ‘Saint Floyd’, Ashli Babbitt will receive no justice from this sick anti-white system,"" said one white supremacist Telegram channel. ""But we will always remember her sacrifice and she will never be forgotten. There is a day coming not far from now when we will erect statues in her honor.""\n\nThe same channel referred to Lt Byrd as a ""black parasite who gets to kill an unarmed white woman and walk around unbothered"", threatening to make him ""account for his actions"". Another neo-Nazi channel claimed that ""Ashli Babbitt was killed because she was white"".\n\nAlex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates against antisemitism and other forms of racism, says such messages are part of a widespread effort by white supremacists to lure recruits from the broader pro-Trump community.\n\n""White supremacists will always try to twist whatever major story is in the news to fit their agenda,"" says Mr Friedfeld. It’s unclear how successful these efforts have been, but the fact that they are trying to leverage the Babbitt story is deeply concerning because it raises the likelihood that someone is radicalised.""\n\nProf Bloom agrees, comparing it to the Proud Boys’ attempts last summer to recruit ""incel"" anti-feminists. She says that while many QAnon believers are not consciously racist, and not all are white, the movement has a pervasive racial bias, with trafficked children usually depicted as white whereas real world child trafficking disproportionately affects children of colour.\n\nProf Bloom also points out that another protester, Rosanne Boyland, died during the riot but has not been turned into a martyr in the same way. The reason, she argues, is that unlike Babbitt’s family, the Boyland’s have blamed Mr Trump for their loved one’s death.\n\nA threat from within America’s military\n\nThe martyrdom of Ashli Babbitt paints a foreboding picture of where American politics is going. To Prof Bloom and Prof Moskalenko, martyrs are a ubiquitous manufactured product of radical movements, useful because of their potency in rallying followers to stay in the fight and seek revenge against the enemy.\n\nMs Castronuova stops short of saying Babbitt was an example others should follow, describing her as a good person sucked into an ""emotionally charged"" and chaotic situation. She is happy to call Babbitt a martyr, claiming: ""She was killed because of her political beliefs, and they continue to kill her image and her memory because of her political beliefs. If she was a liberal and she hated Donald Trump, she would be remembered very fondly by the media.""\n\nMr Friedfelder, however, fears that Babbitt’s lionisation could contribute to an escalating cycle of conflict, and considers politicians’ embrace of Babbitt to be dangerous. While most Republicans have not embraced the idea that she was unjustly killed, few have publicly rebuked it, apparently reluctant to openly challenge Mr Trump even now he is out of office.\n\nThat does not mean they are happy behind the scenes. On Wednesday Mr Trump cancelled a press conference on the anniversary of the riot, reportedly under pressure from mainstream Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he had played golf with Mr Trump at the weekend and warned him that there ""could be peril"" in such an event. Still, history suggests that Mr Trump’s concessions to moderates are rarely permanent.\n\nMr Friedfelder says: ""Her martyrdom turns her into a call to action... it is one thing for extremists to embrace Babbitt, but it is another for the former president and several high-profile members of the Republican Party to do the same. These officials are supposed to be trusted figures and people look to them for guidance when trying to understand national events.""\n\nClaims that Babbitt was murdered or assassinated continue to spread on social media, according to data from the online discussion tracking firm Zignal Labs. Mr Trump’s and Mr Putin’s comments caused spikes in mentions of Babbitt, and the general discussion around 6 January has barely waned over the past year.\n\nProf Bloom believes there is a more acute threat too: Babbitt’s military record. According to a report from START, an academic coalition that studies terrorism, at least 118 of the 719 people charged in connection with the riot, about 16 per cent of the whole, are veterans. In a START extremism database, about 7 per cent of all far-right cases had military experience, with the rest simply listed as unknown.\n\n""We don’t know how many American military [members] have been radicalised, either by MAGA or specifically by QAnon and white supremacy,"" says Prof Bloom. ""There has been a problem of white supremacy in the military for decades that the military has been reticent to deal with.\n\n""It’s dangerous because it’s not just some flunky who wants to make a name for themselves. It’s someone with military training who has weapons and knows how to use them."" She compares most pro-Trump extremists with the bumbling jihadists in 2010’s Four Lions, with lots of anger but limited ways to direct it. ""When you have someone who has been trained by the military or law enforcement, they know how to use that anger.""\n\nProf Moskalenko worries that the conditions are set for yet more political violence in America. ""A martyrdom is a symbol of perceived widespread injustice and suffering. There’s a lot of that going around,"" she says. ""With or without Ashli Babbit, we have problems. Addressing them, rather than getting stuck in the never-ending cycle of rhetoric, competing narratives, and shifting moral frames, is our only hope.""'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.clickorlando.com/news/politics/2022/01/03/ashli-babbitt-a-martyr-her-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a martyr? Her past tells a more complex story - ClickOrlando', 'Snippet': 'In 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.', 'Full_text': ""WASHINGTON – The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt's birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.""}, 7: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/01/06/ashli-babbitts-mom-defends-daughters-actions-at-jan-6riot/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's mom defends daughter's actions at Jan. 6riot"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt was a 36-year-old Air Force veteran and Trump supporter.

Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/ashli-babbitt-a-martyr-her-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/2829546/', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a Martyr? Her Past Tells a More Complex Story', 'Snippet': 'The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight ...', 'Full_text': ""The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt's birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2022-06-11/ashli-babbitt-family-not-filed-wrongful-death-suit-6307638.html', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt’s family still hasn’t filed wrongful death suit, report ...', 'Snippet': 'The family of Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt — the woman shot dead while storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — still hasn’t filed the wrongful-death suit for which their legal team ...', 'Full_text': '(Tribune News Service) — The family of Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt — the woman shot dead while storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — still hasn’t filed the wrongful-death suit for which their legal team raised $460,000, a news outlet in her former hometown reports.\n\nBabbitt was felled by a single shot fired by a Capitol Police officer defending members of Congress as rioters attempted to stop the certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral win. Lt. Michael Byrd, who was cleared of any wrongdoing, fired at Babbitt as she stormed through a door leading into the House of Representatives chamber.\n\nAccording to the CBS 8, an attorney for Babbitt’s family has made repeated claims he would file a $10 million wrongful-death suit on their behalf, but that has not happened. That attorney reportedly said last year the suit would be coming soon.\n\nNeither Babbitt’s widow or the family lawyer responded to the San Diego news station’s requests for information. The online fundraiser page says it “is currently disabled and can not receive new donations.”\n\nCBS said that Thursday’s opening arguments from the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol “hit close to home for San Diegans,” in light of Babbitt’s death. The 35-year-old Air Force veteran had reportedly become an adamant Trump loyalist who appeared to have bought into his lies about the election being stolen. Babbitt drove cross country to attend the “Stop the Steal” event where she found herself mortally wounded on the Capitol floor, wrapped in a Trump flag she was wearing as a cape.\n\nSome right-wingers have come to see Babbitt as a martyr. Others view Byrd and the police officers who fought off the attack as the heroes of Jan. 6. Trump said Babbitt was “murdered” and spread conspiracy theories about her killing.\n\nTerry Roberts, who represents Babbitt’s family, conceded in April 2021 that what Babbitt did may have been illegal, but claimed there was no need to shoot her.\n\n“There was just no legal justification to take her life,” he told WUSA. “We don’t shoot protesters in this country unless they’re an immediate threat to somebody.”\n\nByrd told NBC News in August that had Babbitt and her cohorts succeeded in entering the chamber, those inside would have no escape.\n\n“If they get through that door, they’re into the House chamber and upon the members of Congress,” the officer said.\n\nThe Department of Justice announced in April 2021 that an investigation into the incident revealed Byrd did not act improperly.\n\nIn September, Babbitt’s brother Roger Stefan Witthoeft was charged with a hate crime resulting from an altercation with a San Diego utility worker. According to The San Diego Union-Tribune, he unsuccessfully requested last month that a judge divert prosecution in that case on account of the “extreme stress and trauma” caused by his sister’s death. Witthoeft was also reportedly charged with battering a man he felt was slow in helping a disabled person get out of their car in January. He pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nNew footage revealed by the Jan. 6 Committee on mainstream news networks Thursday offered further insight into the violence of that occurred after Trump told followers once more that day the election had been stolen from him. Testimony leading up to the hearings seems to indicate people in the former president’s inner-circle, including his daughter Ivanka, did not believe the lie being pushed by the 45th president.\n\n©2022 New York Daily News.\n\nVisit at nydailynews.com.'}}",92.9,3

Trump has repeatedly pointed to those claims in his rallies and public statements.\n\nCyber Ninjas and other contractors alleged that election computers were connected to the internet, that there were tens of thousands of potentially illegally cast ballots and that the county purged computer files that could contain evidence of fraud.\n\nWhat did Maricopa County officials say in their rebuttal?\n\nThe detailed response presented in a public meeting of the county Board of Supervisors on Jan. 5 rebutted virtually all the claims made by contractors hired by the state Senate to review its election procedures, equipment, voter registration rolls and ballot tabulation.\n\nThe report said that after ""an in-depth analysis and review of the reports and presentations issued by the Senate’s contractors, we determined that nearly every finding included faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions, and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws.""\n\nSpecifically, Maricopa County officials say of the claims made by the various entities connected to the audit:\n\n22 were found to be misleading. ""The claims lead the reader to assume a conclusion that is not supported by the evidence,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n41 were found to be inaccurate. ""The claims include flawed or misstated analysis,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n13 were found to be false. ""The claims are demonstrably false and can be proven false using materials provided to the Senate,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n""If you are biased or not using an objective process, you’re likely to come to a faulty conclusion,"" said Scott Jarrett, director of the county Elections Department.\n\nDid the county find issues when they analyzed the State Senate report?\n\nThe county experts did find some issues when they analyzed claims in the Senate report. The county review validated only a handful of the 33,000 ballots that the Senate report said could have been illegally cast because voters had moved prior to the election.\n\nFive voters were identified as having voted in more than one county, and six people may have voted twice in Maricopa County. The county report also found 27 cases where ballots were counted that were cast by people who died before they were returned in the mail; those were referred to the state attorney general for more investigation and possible prosecution.\n\nThe county is reviewing another 100 cases involving people who died close to the election but still cast ballots. The Senate report had identified 298 voters who had potentially cast a ballot but died before the election.\n\nIn all, the county found 38 instances were a ballot may have been illegally cast, and all have been sent to the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe county report also said that election workers had inadvertently double counted a batch of 50 ballots.\n\nCould the findings affect the 2020 election results?\n\nThe number of vote counting errors and potential illegal votes would not have affected the outcome of the election. President Joe Biden won Maricopa County by about 45,000 votes, key to his 10,500-vote win of Arizona. Previous reviews of the 2.1 million county ballots by nonpartisan professionals that followed state law have found no significant problem with the vote count in the county, which includes metro Phoenix.\n\nDid the county conduct its own audit?\n\nYes, according to officials.\n\n""After the November 2020 General Election, the County hired two federally certified Voting System Test Laboratories to conduct an audit of the tabulation equipment used to count ballots for all five of the elections administered in 2020,"" read a portion of the report.\n\nAccording to the report, both labs found no anomalies in the tabulation equipment. They also found that:\n\nCertified software were used for all tested software, systems and equipment\n\nNo malware or malicious hardware were installed\n\nNo evidence of internet connectivity was found\n\nOne of the two labs also found the 2020 General Election program and tabulation equipment was accurate, according to county officials. The test was only done by one of that two labs.\n\nWhere can the report be found?\n\nThe report has been uploaded to the Maricopa County Recorder\'s Office website, and can be read here.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to host a rally Jan. 15 outside Florence, his second in Arizona since his election loss.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) contributed to this report.\n\nContinued Coverage\n\nLawyer for Arizona Senate election audit firm wants to quit\n\nFar too little vote fraud to tip 2020 election to Trump, AP review finds\n\nArizona Senate can\'t claim legislative privilege for 2020 election audit records, judge rules\n\nCourt rejects another request to keep Arizona audit public records private\n\nTune in to FOX 10 Phoenix for the latest news'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-election-audit-final-report-finds-no-maricopa-county-data-issues', 'Headline': 'Arizona election audit: Final report finds no Maricopa County data ...', 'Snippet': 'The report compiled by an outside special master and released by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors on March 23 ""should be a final stake in the heart of the Senate’s so-called ‘audit ...', 'Full_text': 'A report that was among the final items on the Arizona Senate’s partisan review of the 2020 election prompted by former President Donald Trump’s loss has found no evidence that ballot tabulation equipment used by the state’s most populous county was connected to the internet.\n\nThe report compiled by an outside special master and released by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors on March 23 ""should be a final stake in the heart of the Senate’s so-called ‘audit,’"" Board Chairman Bill Gates said in a statement.\n\nThe report was the latest to find no evidence of any major problems with the election in Maricopa County.

The texts undermine claims ...', 'Full_text': 'The truth behind the Arizona Senate\'s ""audit"" of 2020 election results is emerging in thousands of private text messages from Cyber Ninjas\' CEO Doug Logan.\n\nThe texts undermine claims the ""audit"" was a nonpartisan effort to ensure the accuracy of election results, revealing it was part of a multi-state effort by allies of former President Donald Trump to restore him to office.\n\nLogan\'s messages show the work of hundreds of volunteers − who spent two months in 2021 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum reviewing ballots and recording individual votes onto more than 70,000 tally sheets − couldn\'t even be counted.\n\nHere\'s the latest on Logan, his texts and the review of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County.\n\nWhat was reason behind the Arizona \'audit\'?\n\nSenate Republicans in 2021 announced they would commission a hand count of every ballot cast in Maricopa County to address claims the election had been stolen from Trump. The Senate subpoenaed the ballots and other election material from the county.\n\nSenate President Karen Fann hired the Cyber Ninjas to lead the hand count. Although neither Logan nor his company had election auditing experience, Fann at the time said he was ""well qualified"" and ""well experienced."" The review was supposed to take a few weeks and cost taxpayers $150,000.\n\nIt would take about two months and cost Arizona millions of dollars.\n\nWhat \'findings\' did Cyber Ninjas report to the Senate?\n\nLogan announced the results of the hand count on Sept. 24, 2021. He reported Joe Biden won the presidential election in Arizona. Logan\'s tally differed from the county\'s official results by 994 votes.\n\nLogan\'s report skimmed over Biden\'s win and raised a host of ""anomalies"" that continued to raise doubts about the election process. It left lawmakers, partisan contractors and Trump allies calling for more audits, the rejection of voting machines and new voter integrity laws to prevent fraud at the polls.\n\nFull story:\'Our numbers are screwy\': Cyber Ninjas CEO admits he couldn\'t tally hand count of ballots\n\nDo Logan\'s private texts contradict his public statements?\n\nYes. In hundreds of recently released texts from the summer of 2021, Logan admitted he couldn\'t make sense of his own data. Days after the hand count ended, Logan confirmed he had no way to tally the results.\n\n""How plausible is this solution looking? I looped back to look through all of the aggregation data again. It (is) pretty broken. A lot of it doesn\'t make any sense,"" Logan wrote in a July 5, 2021, text.\n\nDid Logan say, \'Our numbers are screwy?\'\n\nHe did. Even after he turned over his numbers to Arizona Senate Republicans ― 11 days before the Senate hearing ― Logan was trying to reconcile his own data, with no success.\n\n""Reading through that summary doc on President vs. Senate. Looks like basically our numbers are screwy,"" he said in a Sept. 13 text message.\n\nWhat is Logan\'s response to this?\n\nHe has not responded to repeated interview requests from The Arizona Republic. He has declined to answer specific questions about his text messages or his activities.\n\nHow did the Cyber Ninjas fix the numbers problem?\n\nTexts show they didn\'t. For weeks, Logan tried unsuccessfully to tally more than 70,000 sheets where volunteers recorded individual votes with tick marks. He worked with a technology expert named Mike Piehota, but they couldn\'t come up with a computer system to read the marks.\n\n""To cut to the chase, it\'s my opinion we\'re not going to be able to accurately process tally sheets using current text recognition technology,"" Piehota wrote in a July 6 text. ""Ultimately, we need to consider a different approach if you want to revisit tally sheets in the short term. Other than a massive manual effort, I don\'t have a good answer.""\n\nLogan replied minutes later: ""I don\'t care if we have to hand-write in the batch number, etc. As long as the tally is correct most of the time.""\n\nDid Cyber Ninjas make up numbers?\n\nLogan\'s texts show how his team shifted away from trying to quantify the hand count and sought other means to deliver plausible numbers to the Senate.\n\nThey first tried counting votes by scanning tally sheets. They couldn\'t get a software program to read the tick marks. Then they focused on counting the total number of ballots, scouring county electronic tabulation records, creating worksheets and databases and weighing ballot boxes on scales.\n\nThe texts indicate they failed at these efforts.\n\nIs that why the Senate brought in machines to count ballots?\n\nNeither Logan nor the Senate issued any public statements about the inability to quantify the results of the hand count.\n\nThe hand count ended on June 25, 2021. Days later, Fann said Logan\'s hand count of ballots were far off Maricopa County\'s official results. Fann on July 8 said the Senate had purchased two machine counters as a way to ""triple check"" the numbers.\n\nShe did not disclose the number Logan provided.\n\nWas the Arizona \'audit\' part of a larger election scheme?\n\nThe text messages show Logan already was part of a coordinated effort to overturn 2020 election results in several swing states when he was tapped to lead the Arizona Senate\'s partisan ""audit,"" records show.\n\nThousands of text messages to and from Logan show he worked closely with allies of then-President Donald Trump as they plotted to challenge outcomes in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nTexts show that Fann privately communicated with Logan in February 2021, likely on a recommendation from retired Army Col. Phil Waldron, an ardent Trump supporter and election conspiracy theorist. She publicly named Logan as the audit leader on March 31, 2021.\n\nFull story:Arizona \'audit\' leader traded messages with dozens of \'Stop the Steal\' partisans, texts show\n\nWhen did Logan start strategizing with Trump allies?\n\nLess than two weeks after Trump lost the November 2020 election, Logan was invited to pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood\'s plantation properties in South Carolina to map out ways for challenging election results in swing states, texts and court records show.\n\nLogan testified in a Georgia civil elections case last year that he stayed at the plantation for about six weeks, from Nov. 14 until Dec. 24, rubbing shoulders with members of Trump\'s legal team and other loyalists.\n\nWho on Team Trump helped Logan?\n\nThe strategy meetings involved a who\'s who of Trumpworld conspiracy theorists, cyber specialists, lawyers, retired government officials and some Republican state lawmakers.\n\nThe group included Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, former National Security Agency official Jim Penrose, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Former Army Capt. Seth Keshel.\n\nAll later would participate in the Maricopa County ballot review. They helped Logan raise millions for the ""audit,"" helped him write reports and offered logistical support, texts and court records show.\n\nAre authorities investigating Logan?\n\nLogan was involved in multiple breaches of voting equipment in Georgia and Michigan in the weeks leading up to the Arizona ""audit,"" texts and court records show.\n\nIn January 2021, he and others were captured on video surveillance heading into an elections office in Coffee County, Georgia, where authorities said voting equipment was breached. He has not been charged there.\n\nLogan is under investigation by Michigan authorities for illegally accessing and dismantling voting machines in April 2021 as part of a plot to prove the election was rigged. He has not been charged there.\n\nHow did The Republic get Logan\'s text messages?\n\nThe Republic in June 2021 requested emails, text messages and all other communications from Cyber Ninjas and the Senate. When they refused, The Republic filed lawsuits alleging violations of the Arizona Pubic Records Law.\n\nA judge in January 2022 ordered Logan to turn over all records and communications related to the audit and fined his company $50,000 a day until he complied. The fines now total more than $5 million.\n\nIs Logan still withholding records?\n\nYes. Logan has turned over texts in haphazard, nonsequential batches and in different formats, so threads were broken and not easily searchable. The messages, released in November and December 2022 and February and March 2023, were not organized chronologically or in any other discernable order.\n\nAnd while Logan has released more than 39,000 text messages, he has redacted 3,000 more without explanation and in apparent violation of court orders.\n\nHow did you make sense of 39,000 text messages?\n\nAn independent team of nationally recognized data analysts known as The Audit Guys built software to untangle and organize the messages.\n\nThe Audit Guys have long challenged Logan\'s ballot review as ""fiction"" and after an exhaustive analysis of data in 2021 concluded that Logan\'s ""results"" were wildly inaccurate and made up.\n\nAfter consolidating the texts in a searchable database, The Audit Guys determined Logan at one time omitted about 4,000 messages from his side of conversations and duplicated 5,500 in multiple batches. They have identified gaps in messages, blank and redacted texts and references to messaging systems that Logan never turned over.\n\nWho are The Audit Guys?\n\nThe Audit Guys are Larry Moore, the founder of Boston-based election technology company Clear Ballot Group; Benny White, a prominent Pima County Republican data analyst; and Tim Halvorsen, Clear Ballot\'s retired chief technology officer.\n\nTheir stated mission is to ""debunk election disinformation and confront those who use their power to spread it.""\n\nWhy does the hand count matter two years later?\n\nLogan\'s findings allowed Trump allies to insist the vote was compromised. Its immediate aftermath was to further instill distrust in voting machines and encourage partisan calls for paper ballot tabulations, hand recounts and ""audits."" They have also called for an end to early voting.\n\nWith the 2024 election around the corner, many partisan actors claim without evidence that machine tabulated ballots are rife with fraud. And they insist the only way to prevent fraud is through a hand count of ballots.\n\nLook no farther than Cochise County, where Republican officials in 2022 sought to delay certification of the election until after commissioning a full hand count, which was blocked by the courts.\n\nA judge in April fined two Cochise County supervisors $37,000 in legal and court fees for failing to follow state elections procedures.\n\nHow much has the Arizona \'audit\' cost taxpayers?\n\nTaxpayer costs are about $5 million so far. That includes $518,000 Maricopa County spent in its fight with Senate Republicans over access to its voting equipment and related records and $3.2 million for new voting machines. The Senate has spent at least $1.1 million, of which about half has been spent on legal fees.\n\nIn addition to the public costs, Cyber Ninjas received at least $6.7 million from private donors. The firm last year said it had lost at least $2 million, according to a financial statement shared with the Senate.\n\nCyber Ninjas has since gone out of business'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.courthousenews.com/arizona-supreme-court-to-determine-if-the-public-has-a-right-to-access-cyber-ninja-related-audit-records/', 'Headline': 'Arizona justices to decide if public has right to see Cyber Ninja ...', 'Snippet': 'PHOENIX (CN) — The Arizona Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday over whether the state Senate has the authority to conceal records from an audit of the 2020 presidential election.

Viral online posts distorted his comments to misleadingly claim that half of employees at federal health agencies “are refusing” the vaccines, which Fauci never said.\n\nAt the time, NIAID told us that 67% of the NIH staff were vaccinated, but the “actual number may be higher” because reporting was voluntary.\n\nSee, “Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations,” May 21, 2021\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. But a Gateway Pundit story shared on Facebook in June 2021 declared, “SMOKING GUN: FAUCI LIED, MILLIONS DIED — Fauci Was Informed of Hydroxychloroquine Success in Early 2020 But Lied to Public Instead Despite the Science.”\n\nThe story was based on two emails that were sent to Fauci in February 2020. In one email, two doctors expressed the possibility that the drug could be effective against COVID-19. Fauci forwarded the email to an NIH deputy director who works in microbiology and infectious diseases and wrote: “Please take a look and respond to them. Thanks.”\n\nIn the other email, a pharmacologist made reference to “data from 2005 showing inhibition of SARS infection,” which is a different disease caused by a different coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) from the one that leads to COVID-19. We previously wrote about a 2005 study that found the drug prevented the spread of that SARS virus in cell culture — which is not the same as working in humans.\n\nThose emails are not evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, or that Fauci kept this from the public. In fact, randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The drug was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nA viral social media post falsely claimed that Fauci was “pushing” remdesivir because he “invented” it with Bill Gates and they would profit from its use.\n\nFauci does not hold a patent for remdesivir, and a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told USA Today that the foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of the drug.\n\nSee, “Fauci Didn’t Invent, Won’t Profit from Remdesivir,” May 21, 2020\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nIt is still uncertain how SARS-CoV-2 originated, but many scientists suspect the virus “spilled over” into humans from an animal. There is no evidence the virus was created in a lab, let alone as part of any U.S.-funded research.\n\nA June 2021 Facebook post claimed that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” because of an email he received from Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. In that Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” He mentioned others, too, found “the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\n\nBut Andersen said in his email that more analysis was necessary and “opinions could still change,” which is what later happened.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists that said they determined that the coronavirus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The authors added that they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.”\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nFormer White House trade adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that Fauci “killed a lot of people” by funding some bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is in Wuhan, China, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified.\n\nNIAID did provide a multimillion-dollar grant to fund some of the lab’s research, but the NIH has explained that those experiments could not have led to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because the viruses that were being studied were very different.\n\n“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” then-NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20, 2021, statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”\n\nSee, “Navarro Falsely Links Fauci to Pandemic Origin,” May 19, 2022\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul accused Fauci of lying when Fauci said in a May 2021 Senate hearing that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” But there’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in a July 20, 2021, hearing, about funding gain-of-function research — which the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to “increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.”\n\nFauci has said that the research that was funded “was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,” and the NIH has said the same. The issue is that scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul has posited that Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” if the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research. But there is no proof of a lab leak, and there is evidence that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant could not have caused the pandemic.\n\nSee, “The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,” May 21, 2021, and “Fauci and Paul, Round 2,” July 22, 2021\n\nIn December 2014, the NIH posted a photo of Fauci and former President Barack Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The photo showed Obama speaking about Ebola research with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, and Fauci was shown standing next to Sylvia Burwell, who was the health and human services secretary at the time.\n\nBut the years-old photo was circulated in 2020 along with the false claim that the image showed “Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015,” suggesting a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee, “Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab,'”July 17, 2020\n\nOther Claims\n\nA series of reports in 2021 from a group that opposes federal funding for research relying on animal testing prompted dozens of readers to ask us if Fauci had a history of cruelty to animals, specifically beagles.\n\nThe NIAID admitted to FactCheck.org in a statement that Fauci was involved in the process of awarding funding for a number of research projects that used beagles as test subjects. But the agency denied that it funded one particular project in Tunisia that went viral on social media because of images from a published study that showed sedated beagles with their heads stuck in mesh cages filled with diseased sand flies.\n\nSee, “Answering Questions About #BeagleGate,” Nov. 2, 2021\n\nFauci is among the many federal employees who are required to submit an annual public financial disclosure report to their employing agency or department. His reports — which list his assets, income, employment agreements and other financial information — are available upon request from the NIH’s FOIA office.\n\nBut in a January congressional hearing, Republican Sen. Roger Marshall asked Fauci if he would be willing to publicly release “a financial disclosure form,” suggesting that Fauci’s reports are not available to the public and are being hidden by “the big tech giants.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/fauci-says-sen-pauls-false-accusations-kindle-the-crazies-who-threaten-his-life/2610481/', 'Headline': ""Senate Hearing on Pandemic Gets Testy: ‘What a Moron' - NBC Boston"", 'Snippet': ""Paul and other conservative critics have focused their ire at how the pandemic is being handled on Fauci, the National Institutes of Health infectious disease chief who also is President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser.

For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News.

Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population.

Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners.

To date, WIV has not provided these records.”\n\nLauer added: “Today, NIH informed EHA that since WIV is unable to fulfill its duties for the subaward grant under R01AI110964, the WIV subaward is terminated for failure to meet award terms and conditions requiring provision of records to NIH upon request.”\n\nFBI INVESTIGATED NIH AWARD TO ECOHEALTH AND WUHAN LAB\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released an assessment in 2021 stating that one U.S. intelligence agency assessed with “moderate confidence” that COVID-19 most likely emerged from the Chinese government lab in Wuhan, while four U.S. spy agencies and the National Intelligence Council believe with “low confidence” COVID-19 most likely has a natural origin.\n\nThe NIH’s Lauer also said Friday that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which has been led by Dr. Anthony Fauci for decades, “will begin to engage with EHA to renegotiate the specific aims and objectives of the R01 grant without the involvement of WIV … in light of the cooperation from EHA and the substantial subsequent improvements in administrative processes that EHA demonstrated.”\n\nRep. James Comer (R-KY), the ranking member on House Oversight, hammered the NIH over this.\n\n“Terminating EcoHealth Alliance’s partnership with the Wuhan Lab is the bare minimum,” Comer said Friday. “It’s unacceptable that the NIH continues to allow EcoHealth Alliance to receive taxpayer dollars even though it is confirmed EcoHealth violated the terms of its grant contract. EcoHealth conducted gain of function research on bat coronaviruses in Wuhan, knew about the Chinese Communist Party’s coverup, and failed to inform the U.S. government.”\n\nComer added: “EcoHealth’s dangerous experiments in Wuhan and possible efforts to cover up any evidence may have started the pandemic. EcoHealth should not receive a penny of American taxpayer dollars for their gross mismanagement of Americans’ hard-earned money.”\n\nThe NIH had awarded EcoHealth with a grant dubbed “R01AI110964” years ago, and EcoHealth then doled out three research subawards, including one to the Wuhan lab.\n\n“The research approved under this grant sought to understand how bat coronaviruses evolve naturally in the environment to become more transmissible to the human population,” the NIH said Friday in defending the award. “This type of research is a critical part of pandemic preparedness.”\n\nThe grant to EcoHealth was suspended by the NIH in June 2020 due to “grant administrative non-compliance concerns.” EcoHealth was reprimanded by the NIH in October when the agency found that the organization delayed revealing that a U.S.-funded experiment conducted with the Wuhan lab determined that mice with implanted human cells became sicker with an engineered version of bat coronavirus. The NIH found more EcoHealth violations in January.\n\nRepublicans say the findings showed EcoHealth was funding risky gain-of-function research in China.\n\nEcoHealth leader Peter Daszak was a longtime collaborator with the Wuhan lab who steered hundreds of thousands of dollars in NIH funding to the Chinese lab and was also a key World Health Organization-China joint study team member in early 2021.\n\nDaszak dismissed the lab leak hypothesis in March 2021 when he admitted he took Wuhan lab workers at their word. Meeting minutes from discussions between lab scientists in Wuhan and the WHO-China COVID-19 origins joint study team reveal lab leak concerns were referred to as “myths” and “conspiracy theories.”\n\nAn advisory group assembled by the WHO said in June that the lab leak hypothesis needed further study.\n\nThe NIH said Friday that the prior problems it had identified with EcoHealth’s handling of its coronavirus grant included “inadequate oversight in monitoring the activities of its subawardees, failure to report subawards to the General Services Administration’s Federal Subaward Reporting System, and errors in indirect rate charges.”\n\nBut Lauer nevertheless said EcoHealth might again soon start receiving U.S. tax funding for its bat coronavirus experiments — just without the Wuhan lab’s continued involvement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe NIH had been run until recently by Dr. Francis Collins, while Fauci still leads NIAID.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/us-government-bans-wuhan-lab-from-federal-funding/4017756.article', 'Headline': 'US government bans Wuhan lab from federal funding', 'Snippet': 'The WIV research in question, originally awarded funding by the NIH in 2014 and renewed in 2019, was channelled through the New York-based non-profit EcoHealth Alliance.

Earlier this month, the NIH’s parent agency the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that ‘the immediate suspension of WIV is necessary to mitigate any potential public health risk’.\n\nWIV has been at the centre of unproven claims that the virus that caused the Covid-19 pandemic escaped from its labs. This latest development exacerbates the drama surrounding the US government’s support of coronavirus research in China prior to the outbreak.\n\nThe WIV research in question, originally awarded funding by the NIH in 2014 and renewed in 2019, was channelled through the New York-based non-profit EcoHealth Alliance. EcoHealth received approximately $600,000 (£467,000) for the project, which involved studying coronaviruses in bats and their potential to jump into humans. The project, which was cancelled in April 2020, was originally funded by the Obama administration. It had come under public attack from Republican politicians in the weeks preceding its termination.\n\nHHS does not argue that the project caused the Covid-19 outbreak, but it does criticise WIV for refusing to share certain information relating to its research.\n\nThe HHS memo, recently released by an oversight committee of the US House of Representatives, noted that the NIH determined in an August 2021 review that the WIV research may have yielded an increase in viral activity that violated the terms of the NIH grant. There was no evidence that EcoHealth had notified the NIH about this possibility as it was required to do, according to HHS.\n\n‘NIH has given WIV several opportunities to disprove this finding, but WIV has failed to do so,’ HHS stated. ‘Due to WIV’s disregard of the NIH’s requests … the NIH’s conclusion that WIV research likely violated protocols of the NIH regarding biosafety is undisputed.’\n\nEcoHealth contends that any increase in viral activity was ‘not statistically significant’, and argues that it had reported the results of its experiments in line with NIH’s requirements.\n\nIn a statement to Chemistry World, EcoHealth says that: ‘The [HHS] claim that there was no evidence that EHA notified NIH about the experiment in question is not correct. EcoHealth Alliance provided the Government Accountability Office with documentation regarding this alleged late reporting that showed the experimental results were first reported in the Year 4 report, which was submitted into the NIH system on time in April 2018, with a copy emailed to the NIAID Program Officer at that time.’\n\nEcoHealth had described the goal of the NIH-funded project as constructing Mers and Mers-like chimeric coronaviruses in order to understand the potential origins of Mers in bats.\n\nWhen NIH abruptly terminated the WIV research in 2020, there was worry that political pressure had motivated the decision. At the time, 77 US Nobel laureates and more than 30 scientific societies including the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology expressed concerns about the decision. The NIH reinstated a diminished version of the grant earlier this year, which no longer includes the involvement of WIV.\n\nThis story was updated on 26 July to include comments from EcoHealth Alliance.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-suspends-federal-funding-wuhan-lab-over-non-compliance-2023-07-19/', 'Headline': 'US suspends federal funding to Wuhan lab over non-compliance', 'Snippet': 'WIV has not received federal funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. medical research agency, since July 2020, according to an HHS statement on Wednesday.', 'Full_text': ''}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01930-0', 'Headline': 'NIH to intensify scrutiny of foreign grant recipients in wake ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'The NIH also reserves the right to request access to this supporting documentation as part of its oversight responsibilities.

A vaccinated person refers to someone who has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and a fully vaccinated person has received either a single-dose vaccine or both doses of a two-dose vaccine, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots.\n\nMany countries started to administer additional doses toward the end of 2021 after research found that vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. More than 2.72 billion additional doses have been administered worldwide. Additional doses include booster doses given to fully vaccinated individuals when the protection from the original shots has begun to decline, as well as extra shots given to people, such as the immunocompromised, who did not have a strong immune response from their initial doses.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the manufacturers of two of the most widely used Covid-19 vaccinations, have developed updated vaccines that more effectively protect against the newer Omicron variant. These are currently being administered in many countries, including the United States and Britain.\n\nVaccination rates around the world have stagnated in recent months, with public demand dropping even as vaccine supply has become more abundant.\n\nEarly leads in vaccination rates have become entrenched. Africa has the lowest vaccination rate of any continent, with just 37.2 percent of the population receiving at least one dose of a vaccine, compared to 82.3 percent in Latin America.\n\nMore than two-dozen different vaccines have been used worldwide, according to data from Our World in Data.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/01/14/1072188527/for-the-36-countries-with-the-lowest-vaccination-rates-supply-isnt-the-only-issu', 'Headline': 'Interactive map shows global COVID vaccination rates. 36 nations are ...', 'Snippet': 'Currently fewer than 2% of Yemenis are fully vaccinated.

""If a person wanted to be vaccinated, that person would have to go to the south. So drive around 15 to 20 hours crossing front lines in the mountains."" Even then, after such a treacherous journey through a war zone, it\'s not clear if doses would be available.

Much of the mid-section of Africa is in that category, including powerful economic and political players like Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nBy contrast, many wealthy countries have fully vaccinated more than 80% of their citizens.\n\nWhy Africa lags so far behind\n\nMaaza Seyoum with the African Alliance, a South Africa-based advocacy group, says there are many factors playing in to the low vaccination rates in many countries on the continent but the biggest issue is simply that African nations have struggled to get doses.\n\n""Initially, 100 percent, I would say the problem was a lack of access (to vaccines) and a global system that did not prioritize African countries,"" Maaza says. Wealthy nations bought up far more pharmaceutical firms vaccine production than they could even use. The WHO-backed COVAX program faltered as it relied heavily on voluntary donations and on manufacturers in India who were blocked from exporting doses when COVID case numbers skyrocketed on the sub-continent. Some African countries managed to get supplies from China but Beijing often prioritized donations to wealthier trading partners.\n\nThat situation has changed, says Maaza. Recently vaccine deliveries to Africa have increased. But now there are new problems: the shipments are haphazard and sometimes consist of less popular brands that are about to expire.\n\n""Now we\'re seeing the sort of drip, drip, drip of vaccines,"" she says. ""People are waiting for vaccines to come. They come, then they stop.""\n\nThis unpredictable supply chain, she says, makes it nearly impossible for African countries to plan nationwide vaccination drives. And in some of these places where hardly anyone has gotten the jab, rumors about the mysterious vaccine have flourished and augmented vaccine hesitancy.\n\n""The truth is, there is vaccine hesitancy everywhere,"" Maaza says. ""But as people are waiting, it leaves kind of a fertile ground for these rumors to circulate.""\n\nWhich makes convincing people to come to a clinic and get immunized even more of a challenge.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhat\'s behind those under 10% vaccination numbers\n\nThe World Health Organization set a goal of trying to push all countries to 40% vaccine coverage by the end of 2021. The 36 countries still under 10% obviously didn\'t even get close. Kate O\'Brien, the director of immunization and vaccines for the World Health Organization, says this is a significant problem.\n\n""For countries that are struggling to get even above 10%, what this means is that health-care workers are not fully vaccinated yet,"" she says. ""It means older age populations, those who have underlying medical conditions, the people at highest risk are not fully protected yet.""\n\nShe acknowledges vaccine supply inequity as a major part of why rates are so low in these three dozen countries but says there are other reasons too. Many of these countries had health systems that were struggling even before the pandemic to meet local medical needs. Some of them have needed to upgrade refrigeration systems to be able to store certain mRNA vaccines at extremely low temperatures. Others need syringes. All of this takes money that many low-income nations health ministries may not have.\n\n""A COVID vaccine campaign does require funding,"" O\'Brien says. Countries need money ""to deploy new health workers and to assure that the clinics have the resources that they need.""\n\nAnd while there has been some international assistance to lower-income nations to help, that financing has also at times been haphazard and unpredictable.\n\nOngoing conflicts present another obstacle\n\nAway from Africa, the other nations that haven\'t yet gotten above 10% COVID vaccine coverage are some of the most troubled in the world, including Yemen as well as Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti.\n\nCurrently the armed conflict has displaced 4 million of 30 million Yemenis from their homes. Various groups control different parts of the country. According to the U.N. more than 2/3rds of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance. Yet international aid agencies have struggled to meet those needs and keep their operations running in the country due to the ongoing insecurity and a lack of funding.\n\nFor most people in Yemen, life is incredibly difficult. COVID vaccinations are ""not on the top of the list of priorities for many people in Yemen,"" Jasmin Lavoie with NRC says. He says most Yemenis spend their days trying to find food, shelter, decent toilets and worrying about whether they\'ll have to flee fighting once again. ""These are reasons why people are not getting vaccinated too,"" he adds.\n\nThere are similar issues in other conflict zones.

It compared the U.S. death rate for COVID to other wealthy industrialized countries. America had the highest rates. And, as you can see on this simplified chart of The Times\' data, the U.S. rate was higher than Britain, Germany, Canada, and Japan, just to name a few.\n\nAnd the disparity has been even worse during the spread of Omicron.\n\nSo, why are we continuing to struggle?\n\nWe dig into that now with Jennifer Nuzzo, who studies epidemiology and global health at the Johns Hopkins Center For Health.\n\nIt\'s good to have you with us. And we will start there.\n\nWhat accounts for this high death rate, the U.S., as compared to its peer nations?\n\nDr. Jennifer Nuzzo, Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security: I mean, first of all, we have to acknowledge that it\'s a complete and utter tragedy, because the vast majority of the deaths have been preventable, because many of them have occurred, in fact, most of them have occurred since the development of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nBut what we\'re really seeing is the effect of the United States not making enough progress in vaccinating adults against the virus . And people who are not protected from severe illness by vaccine are, unfortunately, the ones most likely to die.\n\nDr. Jennifer Nuzzo:\n\nSure.\n\nSo I think, in some places, people still do have a hard time getting vaccinated, in part because maybe they work hours that are not conducive to going to get vaccines. But I think we also have not done enough of an effort to emphasize the benefits of vaccines, the fact that they prevent you from severe illness and death.\n\nMany people, I think, are probably focusing on the fact that they know somebody who\'ve gotten vaccinated and they still got COVID. But the fact of the matter is, if you\'re vaccinated against COVID, the likelihood that you will wind up in the hospital is very, very low, compared to people who are not vaccinated.\n\nSo we also have an information environment where people are trying to do their research on vaccines. And, for many people, it\'s much easier to find lies about the vaccines than the truth and to find information about the benefits of these vaccines.So, we really need to do more.\n\nAnd we also need to make sure that we protect the people who are most likely to suffer the severe outcomes of COVID. That includes people who are in the nursing home who may benefit from having a third dose. We have really lagged there compared to other countries in terms of getting third doses out to particularly people over the age of 60.\n\nBut, really, all adults, if you\'re not yet vaccinated, you haven\'t protected yourself against the worst harms that this virus can cause.\n\nDr. Jennifer Nuzzo:\n\nWell, there was an interesting study that just came out today in ""The Lancet"" or just came out recently in ""The Lancet"" looking at probably the single biggest predictor of how countries have performed in terms of COVID outcomes.\n\nIt really comes down to public trust. And, unfortunately, when political leaders make a political issue out of simple biology, which is that the virus is deadly and the vaccines protect people, it unfortunately deters people from getting vaccinated.\n\nI have spoken to lots of people who are not yet vaccinated. And they come to me with — earnestly, but armed with lies, lies that they have seen online, unfortunately, lies that they have heard repeated from political leaders. And if you spend a lot of time talking to people, you can unpack it, and you can change minds.\n\nBut it takes time and it\'s a really hard thing to scale when we\'re in the midst of a crisis. So, what we need to do is make sure that people have access to the right information, that they can talk to people that they trust, and that we can make vaccines available to them.\n\nWe should not assume that people who are not vaccinated don\'t care about COVID. I know lots of people who are scared about the vaccines because of things they have seen online, but are worried about contracting the virus. But we have to continue to have these tough conversations with people and do so in a nonjudgmental, empathetic way, so we can get to that point of their feeling of trust in the message and the benefits the vaccines offer.\n\nDr. Jennifer Nuzzo:\n\nWell, I think one of the things that we have failed to do in the United States is to help people comply with public health recommendations.\n\nWe know that there are barriers for people to comply. Masks are expensive. Getting tested is hard. When people do test positive, that may mean they get shut out of work for 10 or more days. And that\'s very difficult for some people. We haven\'t appropriately supported them financially or socially to make sure that they can comply with public health recommendations.\n\nAnd that\'s one thing that we have seen a number of other countries do, and it really helps people comply in a way that they feel supported and not perhaps put upon or feeling as though they — their rights or freedoms have been restricted.\n\nDr. Jennifer Nuzzo:\n\nWell, everyone should understand that this virus is not going away. It\'s going to be with us for a long time.\n\nSo, any hope that you can sort of sit it out and ride out the storm is an unrealistic one, again, another reason why it\'s great to arm yourself against the virus, your first contact with the virus, through vaccines.\n\nThe virus is not going away. But we\'re still very much in a — more of an emergency response period, because the case numbers that we\'re seeing are still unprecedentedly high. And even if people are protected because they have been vaccinated, or maybe they have gotten COVID before, we\'re still seeing high case numbers that wind up in the hospitals, where that\'s a strain on the health system.\n\nSo, I think we have a ways to go. The good news is, at least here in the United States, is that the case numbers are coming down, the hospitalizations are going down. And I expect, in a few weeks, we will see the death numbers go down.\n\nBut we have to remember this is not just a U.S. problem. This is a global pandemic. And so really our concerns about this virus and every other Greek alphabet letter variant that still could yet emerge is not going to be over until we make sure that the world has access to vaccines, so that people can protect themselves and that we reduce the likelihood of mutations occurring across the globe that could sort of undermine the progress that we have made to date.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01615-8', 'Headline': 'A panel dataset of COVID-19 vaccination policies in 185 countries - Nature', 'Snippet': 'We present a panel dataset of COVID-19 vaccine policies, with data from 01 January 2020 for 185 countries and a number of subnational jurisdictions, reporting on vaccination prioritization plans, eligibility and availability, cost to the individual and mandatory vaccination policies.', 'Full_text': 'The COVID-19 pandemic drove an unprecedented effort to develop and deploy vaccines at scale. As of 15 June 2022, 37 COVID-19 vaccines were in Phase 3 clinical trials, authorized for early use or approved for full use (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html), with some available for use in infants as young as 6 months old1,2. Eleven vaccines have now been given Emergency Use Listing (EUL) from the World Health Organization (WHO)3, and more than 11.9 billion (as of 15 June 2022, https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL) COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered worldwide4,5,6. Nonetheless, more than 30% of the world population remains unvaccinated3, and COVID-19 vaccines and public health measures to promote them have generated substantial political controversy in many countries7.\n\nGiven that vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases will continue to play a critical role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and future diseases, there is an enormous need to better understand both how governments use vaccines and the factors that drive or inhibit uptake. Within the latter, the policies and measures that governments adopt to promote vaccination play an important role. This resource article introduces a new dataset from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) project8 that provides cross-national and longitudinal information on COVID-19 vaccination policies across the world. The new dataset covers vaccine prioritization policies (V1), vaccine availability and eligibility by group (V2), whether there is a cost to individual recipients at the point of use (V3) and mandate policies (V4) (Table 1). Developed in consultation with governments, policymakers, stakeholders in the field and the OxCGRT expert advisory board, this dataset allows researchers and policymakers to systematically compare government vaccination strategies and assess distributional capabilities (see Methods for more information on dataset design). Through combination with other datasets, further analyses, such as on the impact of distribution policies on uptake, are made possible.\n\nThe dataset is composed of four indicators that report national-level COVID-19 vaccination policies for 52 population categories from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022 for 185 jurisdictions in the national database, as well as subnational jurisdictions (provinces) for Canada and (states) for the United States (subnational-jurisdiction data for other countries are in development and will be added to the online data repository as they become available). Collected by a specially trained team of OxCGRT volunteer data contributors, the dataset has been reviewed for quality assurance and accuracy by core OxCGRT researchers and a specially trained review team. The results presented here focus only on the national-level data. The 52 population categories include general and at-risk age groups (in 5-yr intervals for individuals over 16 yr), occupational categories (based on exposure and transmission risk and economic function—groups of people working in occupations critical to the economic function of the country, including essential workers and airport/border staff) and medical categories (based on vulnerability) (Table 2). These closely reflect the categories listed in the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) values framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, a framework that guides the allocation of vaccinations under limited supply to specific population groups to meet specific outcomes.\n\nHere we present some variations and temporal patterns of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization, eligibility, distribution, cost and mandates by group, with the aim of illustrating how the new dataset can offer insights for researchers and policymakers. By mapping variation in vaccination policies over time, this dataset provides a means of responding to critical questions about the role of vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic. The four indicators are presented in the dataset alongside vaccination rates so that users can easily generate cross-national and within-country comparisons to explore associations between vaccination policies, those prioritized for vaccination and vaccine uptake. The dataset’s jurisdiction–day format purposefully facilitates merging with other data sources. For example, combining these four vaccine policy indicators with data about other kinds of pandemic policies—relating to closures, economic support and health, such as testing—allows for assessment of the interplay of vaccination programmes within the broader context of pandemic management. Combining these data with other social science indicators broadens the possibilities further, towards considerations of the impacts of vaccination policies in different economic, political, cultural or religious contexts, and how controversies towards COVID-19 vaccines may have shaped policy. Comparisons between countries with similar demographics, or those with unique demographics and geography might highlight best practice for future pandemics10.\n\nTo motivate use of this new dataset, in this section we illustrate some initial observations using the four vaccine policy indicators. First, we focus on the first two indicators (V1 and V2). We note common patterns in vaccination prioritization strategies according to the broader strategies guiding countries’ pandemic management, and by country income level. We then observe country-level variation in both prioritization and actual distribution by age group and other kinds of vulnerability categories. Second, we consider the additional two indicators (V3 and V4), briefly discussing the cost of vaccination to individuals, before exploring vaccine mandate policies. Although we find limited variation relating to cost across countries—almost all countries provided the vaccine to people free of charge—we detail the diversity of countries’ vaccine mandate policies, ranging from non-existent, to policies specific to certain age groups, occupation groups and populations carrying out specific religious activities, or working in named locations.\n\nComparing countries’ prioritization plans\n\nThe vaccine prioritization (V1) indicator captures the order in which governments planned to deploy COVID-19 vaccines to different categories of people. It depicts the published plans of all countries in the OxCGRT dataset (only Eritrea, of 185 countries, has yet to begin COVID-19 vaccinations or publish a vaccination plan). These plans were primarily used to ration limited supplies at a time when global vaccine supply was constrained. As such, they help reveal the evolving priorities governments held for vaccine deployment.\n\nBroadly, we can distinguish two ideal typical COVID-19 strategies: elimination and mitigation. Roughly, studies have categorized these strategies by observing how eliminators aimed to keep the virus out of the country and to prevent community transmission. In contrast, mitigators sought to reduce the impact of community transmission by flattening the curve and reducing cases and deaths11,12,13,14. Many countries in the WHO West Pacific Region adopted policies closer to the elimination model, perhaps in part due to the region’s previous experience with SARS11,13. Relatedly, it has also been hypothesized that island nations may have been more likely to pursue elimination models during COVID-19 due to their geographical advantage of isolation and ability to seal national borders, although for many low-income countries (LICs) and LMICs, this came at appreciable economic cost11,15,16,17,18. Finally, early responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have also highlighted distinctions between mitigation and elimination strategies based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, such as high-performing surveillance systems with early and targeted contact tracing and widespread efficient testing in eliminator countries12,14.\n\nInterestingly, we observe a clear distinction in the vaccination rollout strategies of countries that have been characterized as pursuing an elimination strategy throughout much of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to countries that pursued a mitigation strategy11,12,13,14,19. Table 3 highlights how nine selected eliminators (selected as examples from a comprehensive list of eliminators, see Supplementary Table 3), such as Australia and New Zealand, prioritized frontline workers and border staff alongside clinically vulnerable people (those with co-morbidities and/or predispositions to illness) in their first rounds of vaccination (that is, positioned rank 1), while nine selected mitigators (see Supplementary Table 3 for comprehensive list of mitigators) focused instead on vaccinating only clinically vulnerable and elderly populations, along with healthcare workers. Looking across all countries in our dataset, while 11 out of 19 (58%) Western Pacific countries prioritized first-round vaccinations on the basis of economic function, only 42 out of 164 (26%) non-Western Pacific countries did so. When looking at the OECD subset, we observe the same pattern: 2 out of 5 countries that adopted elimination in the early stages of the pandemic (40%) prioritized vaccination on the basis of economic function versus 4 out of 32 (12%) mitigators. Finally, the same descriptive pattern holds for island nations (16 out of 32, 50%) when contrasted to non-island nations, with 16 (50%) island countries adopting economic function prioritized vaccination versus non-island countries (38 out of 151, 25%). In contrast, only 3 Western Pacific countries (16%) prioritized clinically vulnerable people, versus 80 (49%) for countries outside the region. However, we observe no differences in descriptive patterns for either OECD or island country groupings. While 3 out of 5 OECD countries that adopted elimination strategies in the early stages of the pandemic (60%) prioritized clinically vulnerable people, 19 out of 32 mitigators did so. Finally, 44% of island (14 out of 32) and 46% of non-island countries (70 out of 151) prioritized clinically vulnerable people.\n\nWhen we map country differences in the most- (or equal-most-) prioritized categories of people (Fig. 1), we observe that almost all countries in our dataset placed healthcare workers among the first to receive COVID-19 vaccines (91% of countries, or 168/185) presumably both to reduce transmission and mitigate health impacts for those at high risk of exposure. Following healthcare workers, 54% (101) of countries also prioritized populations deemed to be clinically vulnerable. Seventy-four countries (40%) prioritized groups of people critical to the economic function of the country, 45 prioritized (24%) categories related to the public function of the country, and 27 countries (15%) focused on educators and/or students for COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nComparing countries’ plans with actual distribution\n\nBy the end of 2021, 62 (34%) countries had published COVID-19 vaccination rollout plans and prioritization lists, often with rough estimates for the timing of each phase. Of those, 48 countries began vaccination before the end of 2021 (Fig. 2), and by 31 March 2021, 107 more countries had published their COVID-19 vaccination plans and priorities. In countries with access to vaccines, deployment swiftly followed plans (captured by indicator V2, which records the groups actually receiving a vaccine in a country). Because vaccine access was highly related to countries’ income levels20, Fig. 2 groups countries according to the World Bank income classification groups for 2021 (https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html). HICs were the first to publish vaccination plans to secure COVID-19 vaccines and to begin administration of vaccines for their populations, reflecting their greater ability to produce and purchase vaccines. Figure 2 shows that the publication of plans and subsequent administration of vaccine doses then followed in upper middle-income countries (UMICs), LMICs and then LICs, respectively. HICs moved quicker to expand vaccination eligibility to the 12+ yr age group than LMICs. It also shows that despite publishing plans and beginning vaccinations at later dates than HICs and UMICs, some LMICs and LICs quickly moved from prioritized vaccinations by age or occupation to universal access (defined in our dataset as being available widely to all those over the age of 16+ yr or 18+ yr, with age floor dependent on vaccine brand). LMICs and LICs have had far fewer vaccine doses available to them than HICs and UMICs (https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/accessibility/), so one possible explanation for the swift movement towards universal access in LICs and LMICs may be an attempt to vaccinate larger proportions of their populations in the face of vaccine hesitancy. However, there are conflicting views on whether LMICs and LICs are more or less vaccine hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccines than HICs and UMICs21,22,23. Another possible explanation for the quick move to (ostensibly) universal access (despite low vaccine supply) may have been to reduce public perception of favouring or excluding certain groups in the face of a public health emergency and with varying social and geographic challenges in the distribution of vaccines24,25.\n\nComparing categories by age and vulnerability status\n\nOnly 11 countries in our dataset did not specifically prioritize elderly populations (the age cut-off for ‘elderly’ is defined locally, see Methods) in their plans and rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Macau, Namibia, Russia, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Uruguay, Zimbabwe and Taiwan). Long-term care facilities (LTCFs; nursing homes, elderly care homes and so on) are a concept and cultural phenomenon predominantly found in some relatively wealthy countries26. This is reflected in our data (Fig. 3), with most African, South Asian and Middle East countries not prioritizing LTCFs in their plans and rollouts. In contrast, while not prioritizing its elderly population in general, Russia did prioritize vaccinations at LTCFs for elderly people before moving to universal eligibility.\n\nAt the younger end of the age scale, children and infants were not included in initial COVID-19 prioritization plans and indeed, the WHO stated that children were a lower priority group as they are less likely to experience serious symptoms27. Clinical research into the safety and efficacy of vaccines in children came later28. Because clinical trials split children into groups of young children (~5–11 yr,) and adolescents (~12–17 yr)29, many countries’ regulatory agencies approved COVID-19 vaccines for children in similar age groups at around the same time as research emerged and as vaccine supplies allowed (Fig. 2). Children 12 and above first became eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations on 6 May 2021 in the territory of Nunavut, Canada, and Bahrain made the COVID-19 vaccine available to children aged 3+ yr on 17 August 2021. As of 15 June 2022, only 12 countries were vaccinating infants (children aged 0–4 yr), 6 being Central and South American countries (Fig. 3), and 26 countries in our dataset have not been recorded as vaccinating children or infants (ages 0–15 yr).\n\nCountries prioritized many professional categories, some of which (for example, healthcare workers) were gendered to varying extents in different countries. Pregnant people were first made eligible for vaccinations in 2021. They were not initially prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination due to a lack of clinical trial data on the effect on unborn children and pregnant people. From January 2020 to 15 June 2022, 21 countries explicitly prioritized pregnant people in their official vaccination rollout plans (V1) (Fig. 4), and 54 out of 185 countries reported specifically administering vaccinations to pregnant people during their vaccination rollouts (V2).\n\nSimilarly, strikingly few countries have prioritized refugees, migrants and ethnic minorities in their COVID-19 vaccination plans or actual rollouts (Fig. 4), despite reports of disparities in the risk of COVID-19 infections and in health outcomes among these groups30,31,32,33,34. Australia, Brazil, Canada and New Zealand all prioritized Indigenous populations in their plans and administration of COVID-19 vaccines (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, Indigenous People, traditional riverine and quilombola communities in Brazil, First Nations in Canada, Māori and Pacific People and their extended families/whanau that care for them in New Zealand). In early June 2021, Greece began a vaccination programme specifically for refugees starting with the island refugee camps, then moving to the mainland camps. Some African countries with high rates of internal migration have prioritized the vaccination of migrants and ‘travellers’ (a term sometimes used for migrants) (Fig. 4)(https://africacenter.org/spotlight/african-migration-trends-to-watch-in-2022/). Many other countries may have made COVID-19 vaccines available to refugees and migrants but may not have explicitly noted this in official documentation.\n\nVaccine cost and mandates\n\nThe dataset reveals that nearly all countries provided the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge to individuals at the point of delivery (V3). From data freely available online from government sources, we observed that Botswana, India, Pakistan and Turkmenistan required a small fee for COVID-19 vaccination from individuals, in some circumstances. In Taiwan, vaccines were free for those meeting eligibility criteria, but individuals could self-fund vaccination in advance of becoming eligible for free vaccines. Some countries enabled individuals to acquire the vaccination privately if they wished or encouraged vaccine tourism in efforts to boost tourism during the pandemic. In late 2021, Russian tourists were accessing free non-Sputnik vaccines in Croatia via specially arranged tours35. Not long after, Russia began to offer their Sputnik COVID-19 vaccine at a cost to tourists (although visas to visit the country were an issue for some)36. Cities and states of the United States, Indonesia, Cuba, the Maldives and the UAE began to use free COVID-19 vaccinations to increase tourism, and travel agencies in the United Kingdom, India and the United States (among others) offered package deals for individuals not yet eligible in their own country to access the vaccine in another37,38,39. These cases are not recorded in our V3 ordinal indicator data but are captured in qualitative coding notes within the dataset.\n\nWe define mandatory COVID-19 vaccination as a government policy requirement to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to work in a specific occupation, or for a specific age group of citizens to be vaccinated. We see these policies as distinct from COVID-19 passports or certification to gain entry to non-essential services or for international travel based on demonstrating immunity or negative test results. These ‘passport’ style policies are defined in the OxCGRT database as ‘differentiated policies’ and are part of the OxCGRT Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) dataset8,40. For 10 of these original indicators, we report two policies, one for vaccinated and another for non-vaccinated individuals, viewing requirements to present passes as a de facto closure (see online documentation and Methods for further detail).\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine mandates (V4) were first introduced in Jakarta, Indonesia, in February 2021 for all adults41. As of 15 June 2022, 55 countries (29%) of our dataset have currently, or had at one time, at least one vaccine mandate policy. Figure 5 shows that mandatory vaccination policies accelerated in implementation around July 2021, commonly according to occupation (83%), with age-based mandates being far less widespread (17%).\n\nThe most common groups to have been mandated for COVID-19 vaccination were related to occupation: government officials (36), healthcare workers (29), staff at LTCFs (15) and educators (22). Hence, in most countries, mandates only affected a small and specific proportion of the population, as opposed to COVID-19 passports which affected the whole population to control their access to services. Six countries (Germany, Ethiopia, Kuwait, New Zealand, Russia and Tonga) mandated vaccines for socially vulnerable and or other vulnerable populations (see Table 2). Nine countries, including Indonesia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan mandated COVID-19 vaccination for the entire adult population. Ecuador mandated vaccination for all those over 5 yr and in Costa Rica, all those aged 3–18 yr must be vaccinated (""×"" symbol in Fig. 5). The qualitative notes section of this new vaccine dataset records how some countries introduced specific vaccine mandates for particular groups relevant to their local context, such as those observing the Hajj in Saudi Arabia, Jahh in Bangladesh, and maritime and port workers in Singapore.\n\nIn this section we describe the design, structure, collection, publication and review of the panel dataset of COVID-19 vaccine policies, with the jurisdiction–day as the unit of analysis. All OxCGRT data are available on GitHub and are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution CC BY standard. Data users should refer to the project website for updated documentation and methodologies (https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker). Excel (v.16), Stata (v.17.0) and R (v.4.1.3) software were used for all analysis and images produced in this resource article.\n\nIndicators\n\nIn late 2020, the OxCGRT team began to consider the COVID-19 vaccine policies and strategies that might be deployed globally. Extensive consultations with government officials, policymakers, experts and stakeholders in the relevant fields, consideration of critical gaps in existing data at the time, and capacity to collect such information resulted in a focus on four priority policies to measure (vaccine indicators V1–V4): who was prioritized for vaccines, who was eligible and receiving vaccines and in what order, who was paying for vaccines, and who was mandated to be vaccinated. Additional indicators for future consideration could include which vaccines were approved/deployed in each country, prioritization for additional/booster vaccinations, vaccine dose timing (manufacturer recommendations vs timeline chosen by country for subsequent doses), government vaccination incentives, vaccination education strategies/programmes and internal vs external funding for vaccines.\n\nVaccine prioritization (V1) records the ranked position for different groups within a country’s prioritization plan. This is the official plan of the official order in which categories are to be vaccinated. This is recorded regardless of whether a country has capacity to distribute and administer vaccines. Vaccination eligibility/availability (V2) is a categorical/binary variable that records which categories of people, regardless of their position in a prioritized rollout plan, are currently receiving vaccinations. This is recorded as a non-zero value if there is evidence that people in this category are being vaccinated, whether this is happening in a targeted geographical region or nationwide. There must be de facto evidence that this is happening to record a non-zero value in V2. For ‘elderly’ groups, we used local elderly age definitions using qualitative notes where available. In the absence of local guidance on elderly age range, a default of 65+ yr was used. Vaccine financial support (V3) is recorded on an ordinal scale. It reports how vaccines are funded for each category selected in V2 as currently receiving vaccination (1 for full cost to individual, 2 for partially funded by government, 3 for fully funded by government/free). Mandatory vaccination (V4) is a binary variable which reports the existence of a requirement for a category of people to be vaccinated. These are government policy requirements to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to work in a specific occupation, or for a specific group to be vaccinated. This is a mandatory vaccination required as part of occupation or citizenship, and we do not record policies that only ‘encourage’ voluntary vaccination to access non-essential services, facilities or freedoms. For example, if healthcare workers must be vaccinated to attend their place of work, this is recorded in V4. As detailed in our interpretation guidance, if there is a vaccine mandate in place for workers of certain occupations, and non-vaccinated people in this occupation have the option of testing regularly to opt out of vaccination, we still record this as a mandate in V4. If vaccination is mandatory in a subnational region as a result of an official national or local government policy, we record this in V4. We do not report enforcement of vaccine mandates, just the policy.\n\nThe vaccination policy dataset also contains summary indicators. These use an ordinal scale to report one number per indicator to offer a succinct summary on the basis of data entered for variables in the main V1–V4 dataset. These are summarized in our codebook (see Supplementary Information). V2, V3 and V4 policies are reported as non-zero values on the date when the policy came into effect, as opposed to the date they were announced. We report the V1 government rollout prioritization plan on the date the policy was published. For the analysis in this paper, the detailed qualitative notes section was used to manually find specific age floors for when different ages became eligible for vaccination, rather than using the age ranges in the quantitative data due to the limitations described above.\n\nIn March 2022, the OxCGRT NPI dataset and data structure was altered to reflect the different policies for unvaccinated and vaccinated people (for COVID-19), where passes or proof of either negative testing or vaccination were required to access different areas of public life (https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-scratchpad/tree/master/differentiated_vaccination_policies). For ten indicators (C1–8, H6 and H8), both the policy values for non-vaccinated and vaccinated people are reported if there are different policies in place. If there is no differentiation, one value is reported. These differentiated values relate only to ‘voluntary access’ to elements of public life, such as attending large events or entertainment and dining venues, which are controlled by testing, evidence of previous immunity or vaccination status through a form of certification or proof.\n\nIt is valuable to record both mandatory vaccine policies and voluntary vaccine pass/passport policies. This differentiated coding is reported in our NPI dataset with ‘V’ and ‘NV’ designations (for example, ‘C1V_School closing’ and C1NV_School closing’) and is distinct from the ‘V4 - mandatory vaccination’ indicator reported in this paper.\n\nData collection\n\nWe collected and published data on publicly available sources, which are freely available through internet searches. These are found on government websites, policy briefs and reputable news outlets. The best-quality sources are original policy documents and high-quality media outlets. These sources are codified into the OxCGRT data protocol and entered into the database. A detailed qualitative note (written in English) and web-archived source are provided for context.\n\nThe V1–V4 data for the national dataset were initially collected by OxCGRT researchers and a small group of experienced and specially trained volunteer data collectors who received specific training. As of 1 January 2022, data collection for V1–V4 was integrated into the core OxCGRT data collection process, which involves an international team of hundreds of volunteer data collectors covering 90+ unique languages. Where language was a barrier, and where English sources could not be found, local speakers from the pool of OxCGRT contributors were consulted, or translation tools such as Google Translate were utilized. The majority of data collectors are/were postgraduate students at universities around the world. Each data collector completed a bespoke online e-learning course, which took around 45 min to complete, covering the V1–V4 indicators, key coding interpretation points and data quality. Every week of data collection was reviewed by a member of the OxCGRT team for quality and accuracy, and was further reviewed by a trained V1–V4 specific volunteer reviewer (also trained via a bespoke reviewer training e-learning course) and confirmed in the database over the medium to longer term. On GitHub, we published both a codebook and an interpretation guide to standardize interpretation and ensure that all coders were making the same logical choices for data entry. We also published a ‘best fit’ table which records where categories have been substituted when there is a category announced in a policy that is not listed in V1/2, ensuring the standardization of ‘best fit’ interpretation (Supplementary Table 4). This highlights the importance of the ‘notes’ function for each indicator, enabling an in-depth qualitative analysis of the data beyond the numerical summaries. Qualitative notes in our comma-separated values files (CSVs) can be used to find archived original policy documents and specific groups prioritized in each country if a best fit has been used.\n\nData publication and summary indicators\n\nThe data are published in a standalone ‘Vaccines_full.csv’ on GitHub, which includes all the 52 categories for V1–V4. They are also summarized in 9 summary indicators, which report one single number for V1 (vaccination prioritization), V2 (vaccination eligibility/availability) categories (overall summary, general population age floor, at-risk age floor, medically clinically vulnerable (non-elderly), education, frontline workers (non-healthcare), frontline workers (healthcare)) and V3. These summary indicators are included in most of our data CSVs on GitHub, including the NPI dataset ‘OxCGRT_nat_latest.csv’. The data are published in real time and updated each week by the team of international data collectors.\n\nIndependent data quality check\n\nWe conducted a data quality and accuracy check, where two core team researchers checked the data and original source material for 100 randomly selected data entry points, focusing on the period of time when the majority of new policies and policy changes were being made, and during which the majority of data were entered for all four vaccination policy indicators. The researchers independently verified that 90% of the original data entries in the database were correct, by analysing original source material and checking this alongside the database entries. The remaining 10 entries were corrected. Specifics such as date of announcement vs date of policy effect, accuracy of selected groups and ages, and ensuring that any recorded mandates were in fact government mandates were among the various checks in this independent data quality review process.\n\nAs part of the weekly data update cycle, a small team of specially trained reviewers are tasked with checking and confirming data entered. As part of this review process, changes to the data are made retroactively, meaning values on past dates may change. As a result, we recommend downloading the most recent data and stating the download date when using them for analysis. The data used for this paper up to 15 June 2022 have been checked thoroughly by the authors. On the rare occasion where data could not be verified or confirmed by local sources, or via translation, they were not included. An unintentional consequence of this is that a group that was prioritized/eligible/mandated to receive a COVID-19 vaccine may not have been captured by our dataset.\n\nComparison to other data sources\n\nWe do not know of any other datasets publishing systematic data on COVID-19 vaccine policies. This unique source therefore adds considerable value to other datasets. For example, the Reuters COVID-19 vaccination tracker, although no longer updating data, reported the prioritization plan (similar to V1 - vaccine prioritization), availability and eligibility (similar to V2 - vaccination eligibility/availability) of different groups for vaccination in each country, although this does not provide the original archived source material, dates or a time series dataset to evidence when groups became eligible (https://www.reuters.com/graphics/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/). The Africa CDC Vaccine Dashboard also reports the date vaccination campaign commenced (similar to V2) in African nations, although it does not provide original archived source material, or state when which groups began to receive vaccines (https://africacdc.org/covid-19-vaccination/). Coronanet includes questions on the number of priority groups for vaccine distribution (similar to V1) but only through 2021 (https://www.coronanet-project.org/assets/CoronaNet_Codebook.pdf).\n\nVaccine policy data are particularly useful when combined with information on the number of vaccine doses administered. For example, the OxCGRT vaccine policy data are displayed as part of Our World in Data’s COVID-19 vaccinations website resource3, which combines country-specific vaccination data into a single resource. Our data can be compared to variables such as proportion of the population that has received one dose, vaccination uptake rates and number of doses administered, to consider the effects of vaccination policies on these. Our H7 indicator, which is a summary of our V2 vaccination policy indicator, is also displayed here. The data are also used by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and WHO’s Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity (https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/), demonstrating their value in informing an interactive accessible tool to reflect the data on the COVID-19 rollout to ensure equitable access.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/graphics/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/', 'Headline': 'COVID-19 vaccine rollout: charts, maps and eligibility by country', 'Snippet': 'COVID-19 vaccination data can be reported by countries as the total number of doses administered and/or the number of people vaccinated.

Our journalists are collecting, verifying and updating information on vaccine availability and eligibility as the plans are announced and implemented by governments and health authorities around the world.\n\nReuters is also analysing how quickly countries are vaccinating their populations, using data collected from over 130 countries by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination data can be reported by countries as the total number of doses administered and/or the number of people vaccinated. Because most coronavirus vaccines require two doses, many countries also report the number of people who have received just one dose and the number who have been fully vaccinated.\n\nMany of the charts on this page show the number of people who have received at least one dose of a vaccine, which can offer significant protection against severe disease and reduce the risk of transmission, according to some studies.\n\nIf a country only reports the number of doses they have administered in total, we do not know the number of people who have been vaccinated. Those countries are excluded from our charts and statistics about people vaccinated.\n\nHow fast are countries vaccinating?\n\nDo some countries have an advantage?\n\nYes, generally richer and more developed countries have better health care infrastructure to manufacture, acquire and administer doses.\n\nAbout 24 % of people who have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine were from high income countries, and at least 0 % were from Europe and North America. (Again, that only includes data from countries that report these figures.)\n\nShow by\n\nWho is getting vaccinated?\n\nBecause of the limited availability of vaccines, most countries are prioritizing certain groups of people to receive their shots before others. People who are older or more likely to become very ill or die from COVID-19 are usually prioritized over those who are young and healthy. Some groups are prioritized because they are more likely to come into contact with an infected person based on what they do or where they live and, in turn, infect others.\n\nReuters has collected information on these priority groups for dozens of countries and determined which groups are currently eligible for vaccination.\n\nTap through the table below to see detailed information for each country.

The previous global case record set last April has already been broken three times this week.\n\nThe United States, Canada and much of Western Europe are leading the surge, with both regions seeing record-breaking levels of new coronavirus cases. The daily average number of new cases in the United States on Tuesday was more than 267,000, exceeding the previous all-time peak set in January; Wednesday’s average was higher still, at more than 300,000.\n\nNew cases in at least 11 European countries — Britain, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain and Switzerland — also passed their previous all-time peaks on Tuesday or Wednesday. In France, the daily case average passed 100,000.\n\nCases in Canada have also seen a steep increase in recent days, more than doubling in a week to an average of more than 25,000. And Australia’s cases climbed to an average of more than 12,600 on Wednesday — eight times as high as just three weeks earlier.\n\nAs dramatic as these case counts are, they are also likely an undercount because of asymptomatic cases, reporting lags due to the holiday season, lack of test availability in many places and at-home tests whose results may not be reported.\n\nIn the United States, where Omicron is spreading quickly, 16 states and Puerto Rico are at their all-time case records. These include states with comparatively high vaccination rates: Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island, all of which are at least 70 percent fully vaccinated. In addition to being more transmissible generally, Omicron also appears to give rise to more breakthrough infections.\n\nSimilarly, some of the European countries currently facing serious surges have among the world’s highest vaccination rates. In Portugal, where 88 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, cases are up more than 200 percent in the past two weeks. Spain, where new cases have more than quintupled in the past three weeks, is 80 percent fully vaccinated.\n\nSo far, overall hospitalization and death rates have not come close to reaching previous peak levels, though some places are struggling. About 78,000 people in the United States are hospitalized with the virus, compared with over 130,000 at the height of last winter’s peak. The average daily rate of deaths across much of the world also remains lower than the record rates seen earlier in the pandemic.\n\nA combination of immunity from vaccines, booster shots and previous infections is most likely at least partially responsible for lower hospitalization and mortality. Encouraging early data also suggests the Omicron variant may be less virulent than previous strains of the virus.\n\nThe recent surges in all these places, however, have been fast and steep, and severe outcomes usually lag case spikes by at least a few weeks, so hospitalizations and death rates may rise in the coming days.\n\n“This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse and again disrupting lives and livelihoods,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said at a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nCase rates in South America, Asia and much of Africa have so far remained relatively low. And at least some countries that saw record case loads this month may be turning a corner. In southern Africa, where scientists first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization, cases remain higher than on the rest of the continent but appear to be abating.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. health officials continued to stress the importance of vaccination and booster doses. In a White House news briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that people eligible for a booster shot who have not yet gotten one “do have some protection against severe disease and death,” though she added that “they do have quite a bit of waning with regard to protection against infection.”\n\nThat group with waning immunity comprises those who completed a Moderna or Pfizer two-dose series six months ago or more, or received a Johnson & Johnson shot at least two months ago.\n\nAlthough Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, discouraged large New Year’s Eve parties, his advice in the news conference Wednesday was more measured when it came to small gatherings of vaccinated people.\n\n“Although the risk is never zero in anything, the risk is low enough that we feel you should continue to go through with those plans of having a home-related, vaccinated, boosted gathering with family and close friends who are also vaccinated and boosted,” he said.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.statista.com/statistics/1223436/covid-19-vaccines-by-number-of-countries/', 'Headline': 'COVID-19 vaccines by reach in countries worldwide 2021 - Statista', 'Snippet': ""As of mid-March, 2021, BioNTech's and Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine was the most widespread COVID-19 vaccine worldwide, with 72 countries administering the vaccine.
