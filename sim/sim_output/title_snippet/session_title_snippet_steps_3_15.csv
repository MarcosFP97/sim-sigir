Noted conspiracy theorist Milton William Cooper first ushered this rallying cry into the mainstream in the 1990s through his radio show, where he discussed schemes involving things such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, an Illuminati cabal and alien life. Cooper died in 2001, but his legacy lives on. Radio host Alex Jones’s fans, anti-vaccine activists and disciples of QAnon’s convoluted alternate reality often implore skeptics to do their own research.\n\nYet more mainstream groups have also offered this advice. Digital literacy advocates and those seeking to combat online misinformation sometimes spread the idea that when you are faced with a piece of news that seems odd or out of sync with reality, the best course of action is to investigate it yourself. For instance, in 2021 the Office of the U.S. Surgeon General put out a guide recommending that those wondering about a health claim’s legitimacy should “type the claim into a search engine to see if it has been verified by a credible source.” Library and research guides, often suggestthat people “Google it!” or use other search engines to vet information.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nUnfortunately, this time science seems to be on the conspiracy theorists’ side. Encouraging Internet users to rely on search engines to verify questionable online articles can make them more prone to believing false or misleading information, according to a study published today in Nature. The new research quantitatively demonstrates how search results, especially those prompted by queries that contain keywords from misleading articles, can easily lead people down digital rabbit holes and backfire. Guidance to Google a topic is insufficient if people aren’t considering what they search for and the factors that determine the results, the study suggests.\n\nIn five different experiments conducted between late 2019 and 2022, the researchers asked a total of thousands of online participants to categorize timely news articles as true, false or unclear. A subset of the participants received prompting to use a search engine before categorizing the articles, whereas a control group didn’t. At the same time, six professional fact-checkers evaluated the articles to provide definitive designations. Across the different tests, the nonprofessional respondents were about 20 percent more likely to rate false or misleading information as true after they were encouraged to search online. This pattern held even for very salient, heavily reported news topics such as the COVID pandemic and even after months had elapsed between an article’s initial publication and the time of the participants’ search (when presumably more fact-checks would be available online).\n\nFor one experiment, the study authors also tracked participants’ search terms and the links provided on the first page of the results of a Google query. They found that more than a third of respondents were exposed to misinformation when they searched for more detail on misleading or false articles. And often respondents’ search terms contributed to those troubling results: Participants used the headline or URL of a misleading article in about one in 10 verification attempts. In those cases, misinformation beyond the original article showed up in results more than half the time.\n\nFor example, one of the misleading articles used in the study was entitled “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter.” When participants included “engineered famine”—a unique term specifically used by low-quality news sources—in their fact-check searches, 63 percent of these queries prompted unreliable results. In comparison, none of the search queries that excluded the word “engineered” returned misinformation.\n\n“I was surprised by how many people were using this kind of naive search strategy,” says the study’s lead author Kevin Aslett, an assistant professor of computational social science at the University of Central Florida. “It’s really concerning to me.”\n\nSearch engines are often people’s first and most frequent pit stops on the Internet, says study co-author Zeve Sanderson, executive director of New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics. And it’s anecdotally well-established they play a role in manipulating public opinion and disseminating shoddy information, as exemplified by social scientist Safiya Noble’s research into how search algorithms have historically reinforced racist ideas. But while a bevy of scientific research has assessed the spread of misinformation across social media platforms, fewer quantitative assessments have focused on search engines.\n\nThe new study is novel for measuring just how much a search can shift users’ beliefs, says Melissa Zimdars, an assistant professor of communication and media at Merrimack College. “I’m really glad to see someone quantitatively show what my recent qualitative research has suggested,” says Zimdars, who co-edited the book Fake News: Understanding Media and Misinformation in the Digital Age. She adds that she’s conducted research interviews with many people who have noted that they frequently use search engines to vet information they see online and that doing so has made fringe ideas seem “more legitimate.”\n\n“This study provides a lot of empirical evidence for what many of us have been theorizing,” says Francesca Tripodi, a sociologist and media scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. People often assume top results have been vetted, she says. And while tech companies such as Google have instituted efforts to rein in misinformation, things often still fall through the cracks. Problems especially arise in “data voids” when information is sparse for particular topics. Often those seeking to spread a particular message will purposefully take advantage of these data voids, coining terms likely to circumvent mainstream media sources and then repeating them across platforms until they become conspiracy buzzwords that lead to more misinformation, Tripodi says.\n\nGoogle actively tries to combat this problem, a company spokesperson tells Scientific American. “At Google, we design our ranking systems to emphasize quality and not to expose people to harmful or misleading information that they are not looking for,” the Google representative says. “We also provide people tools that help them evaluate the credibility of sources.” For example, the company adds warnings on some search results when a breaking news topic is rapidly evolving and might not yet yield reliable results. The spokesperson further notes that several assessments have determined Google outcompetes other search engines when it comes to filtering out misinformation. Yet data voids pose an ongoing challenge to all search providers, they add.\n\nThat said, the new research has its own limitations. For one, the experimental setup means the study doesn’t capture people’s natural behavior when it comes to evaluating news says Danaë Metaxa, an assistant professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. The study, they point out, didn’t give all participants the option of deciding whether to search, and people might have behaved differently if they were given a choice. Further, even the professional fact-checkers that contributed to the study were confused by some of the articles, says Joel Breakstone, director of Stanford University’s History Education Group, where he researches and develops digital literacy curriculums focused on combatting online misinformation. The fact-checkers didn’t always agree on how to categorize articles. And among stories for which more fact-checkers disagreed, searches also showed a stronger tendency to boost participants’ belief in misinformation. It’s possible that some of the study findings are simply the result of confusing information—not search results.\n\nYet the work still highlights a need for better digital literacy interventions, Breakstone says. Instead of just telling people to search, guidance on navigating online information should be much clearer about how to search and what to search for. Breakstone’s research has found that techniques such as lateral reading, where a person is encouraged to seek out information about a source, can reduce belief in misinformation. Avoiding the trap of terminology and diversifying search terms is an important strategy, too, Tripodi adds.\n\n“Ultimately, we need a multipronged solution to misinformation—one that is much more contextual and spans politics, culture, people and technology,” Zimdars says. People are often drawn to misinformation because of their own lived experiences that foster suspicion in systems, such as negative interactions with health care providers, she adds. Beyond strategies for individual data literacy, tech companies and their online platforms, as well as government leaders, need to take steps to address the root causes of public mistrust and to lessen the flow of faux news. There is no single fix or perfect Google strategy poised to shut down misinformation. Instead the search continues.""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06883-y', 'Headline': 'Online searches to evaluate misinformation can increase its ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Specifically, we analysed the search terms for those searching online about the false/misleading article titled: “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to ...', 'Full_text': 'The theory of data voids suggests that, when individuals search online about misinformation, especially misinformation around breaking or recently published news, search engines may return little credible information, instead placing non-credible information at the top of results20. These data voids likely exist for a variety of reasons. Low-quality publishers have been found to use search engine optimization techniques and encourage readers to use specific search queries when searching online by consistently using distinct phrases in their stories and in other media20. These terms can guide users to data voids on search engines, where only one point of an unreliable view is represented. Low-quality news sources also often re-use stories from each other, polluting search engine results with other similar non-credible stories. It was previously argued (page 75 of ref. 30) that the media dynamics in the United States (particularly on the right) “tend to reinforce partisan statements, irrespective of their truth”. Tripodi31 shows how Google’s search algorithms interact with conservative elite messaging strategies to push audiences towards extreme and, at times, false views. This ‘propaganda feedback loop’ creates a network of outlets reporting the same misinformation and therefore can flood search engine results with false but seemingly corroborating information. The topics and framing of false/misleading news stories are also often distinct from those covered by mainstream outlets, which could limit the amount of reliable news sources being returned by search engines when searching for information about these stories. Finally, direct fact-checks may be difficult to find given that most false narratives are never fact-checked at all and, for stories that are evaluated by organizations such as Snopes or PolitiFact, these fact-checks may not be posted in the immediate aftermath of a false article’s publication. As a result, it would not be surprising that exposure to unreliable news is particularly prevalent when searching online about recently published misinformation.\n\nTo investigate the prevalence and effect of exposure to unreliable information while searching for information online, study 5 combines survey data with digital trace data. In this final randomized controlled trial (between-respondents study), we collected articles using the same article-selection protocol and, as in study 1, asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles within 72 h of publication and in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was required to search online using Google before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity, whereas the control group was not. For those in the treatment group, we collect the URLs that they visited and the top ten Google search engine results to which they were exposed by means of a custom-made browser plug-in that respondents consented to install. Over this 12 day study, we recruited 1,677 respondents living in the United States through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and presented them with three highly popular articles from mainstream and low-quality sources within 72 h of publication. Over the course of this study, 17 false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in the control (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and treatment (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents) groups. By asking the respondents in both the control and treatment groups to install a custom web extension that collected their web browsing behaviour, we were able to collect digital trace data associated with 73% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the treatment group and 91% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the control group. This differential attrition was probably due to technical differences between the extension used by the treatment and control groups, but does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey across the groups (further analysis, including difference in means testing, is provided in the Methods). We still collected the survey results for all of the respondents regardless of compliance and used these responses for the analyses in Fig. 2b. We excluded non-compliant responses from our analysis only when we analysed the effect of the quality of search engine results. We excluded all non-compliant respondents in these analyses to limit possible selection effects, but these respondents were included in all of the other analyses.\n\nFigure 2a presents the proportion of the treatment group’s search queries about true and false/misleading articles that return at least one unreliable news source in their Google search engine results. To assess the reliability of a news source, we used classifications from the NewsGuard service, which provides reliability and trustworthiness scores from journalists available at the time of the study (August 2021). Sites with a score of below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score above 60 are deemed to be reliable; a histogram of NewsGuard scores for the majority of online news domains is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1 in Supplementary Information C. Figure 2a shows that search queries about true articles are much less likely to return unreliable news among search results than search queries about false/misleading articles (22.5 percentage point difference, F = 105.8, P < 0.0001). Only 15% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about true articles, whereas 38% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about false/misleading news.\n\nUsing evaluations from study 5, we measured the effect of searching online on the belief in false articles. Figure 2b presents the treatment effect (encouraged to search online) on the probability of believing misinformation using both a dichotomous outcome (rating a false/misleading story as true: 1, yes; 0, no), a seven-point ordinal scale of veracity and a four-point ordinal scale. Like the previous four studies, we found that those who search online about misinformation were more likely to believe false news stories to be true than those who did not. We found that the effect of SOTEN is greater than in the previous studies, which we suspect may be due to the fact that the search treatment is likely stronger in this study relative to the others given that we could verify compliance for full compensation. In this final study, searching online increased the probability that a respondent rated a false or misleading article as true by 0.107 (P = 0.0143, Cohen’s D = 0.21, n = 1,485). Searching online also increased the average score by 0.16 (P = 0.0434, Cohen’s D = 0.16, n = 1,485) on a four-point ordinal scale, but not on a seven-point ordinal scale (P = 0.201, Cohen’s D = 0.10, n = 1,485). We present the differential effect of SOTEN by political ideology in Extended Data Fig. 2 (explanation for how the ideology of each respondent and the ideological perspective of each article is measured can be found in Supplementary Information I and L).\n\nUsing digital trace data collected through the custom browser plug-in, we are able to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation among those exposed to unreliable and reliable information by search engines. To this end, we measured the effect of being encouraged to search online on the belief in misinformation for our control group and two subsets of the treatment group: those who were exposed to Google search engine results that returned unreliable results (defined as at least 10% of links coming from news sources with a NewsGuard score below 60) or very reliable results (defined as the first ten links coming only from sources with a NewsGuard score above 85). Roughly 42% of all evaluations in the treatment group fit in either of these two subsets; although subsetting the data in this way ignores 58% of the treatment group, we are interested in the effect of search among groups exposed to very different levels of information quality. Our next analysis looks at the whole set of responses. Across these two subsets, Fig. 2c shows that the probability that an individual believes false/misleading news stories to be true is substantially higher in the treatment group than the control group among respondents whose news exposure is composed of at least 10% unreliable news sites (n = 1,027, P = 0.0035, Cohen’s D = 0.29), but it is not higher among those in the treatment group who are only exposed to very reliable news sites (n = 940, P = 0.926, Cohen’s D = 0.01) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.147) in favour of the null hypothesis). These results are consistent with the theory that lower-quality search engine results can increase belief in misinformation by returning low-quality results. As further evidence, in Fig. 2d, we used the entire sample and calculated the probability of rating misinformation as true by quartile of the mean news quality across the top ten links returned by Google during the evaluation, leading to similar results. Figure 2d shows that respondents who are exposed to search engine results with the lowest-quality news are more likely to rate false/misleading news as true (n = 1,006, P = 0.0241) compared with those who are not asked to search, whereas those who are exposed to the highest-quality news are not more likely to rate a false/misleading article as true than those in the control group (n = 1,008, P = 0.420) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.182) in favour of the null hypothesis). This again suggests that exposure to unreliable news may explain why SOTEN increases belief in misinformation. Moreover, we found that respondents who are exposed to the top half of information quality in our sample information (top 50%) are no more likely to believe misinformation than those in the control group (n = 1,113, P = 0.429) (we confirmed this null finding using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.103) in favour of the null hypothesis). To be clear, the information returned by the Google search results is post-treatment, so this analysis does not infer a causal relationship32, but it provides evidence consistent with the theory that low-quality information returned by search engines could explain the search effect that we identify. Note that we did not find a statistically significant differential effect of low-quality information on belief across different levels of ideological congruence to the news article (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\nIf our proposed explanation is indeed correct and exposure to low-quality search results is associated with belief in misinformation, it remains unclear why certain individuals are exposed to low-quality news sources whereas others are not. In the next section, we investigate the search terms that individuals use to see whether this is associated with exposure to low-quality results. Specifically, we consider whether evidence from our study is consistent with two plausible interpretations for why individuals use search terms that are more likely to return low-quality information: ideological congruence with the perspective of the misinformation and digital literacy.\n\nIn all six studies, we received informed consent from all of the participants. We also excluded participants for inattentiveness. The researchers were not blinded to the hypotheses when carrying out the analyses. All experiments were randomized. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.\n\nThe preregistration for studies 1 and 2 is available online (https://osf.io/akemx/). The methods that we use for all six studies are based on the analysis outlined by this preregistration. It specified that all analyses would be performed at the level of the individual item (that is, one data point per item per participant) using linear regression with standard errors clustered on the participant. The linear regression was preregistered to have a belief in misinformation dummy variable (1 = false/misleading article rated as ‘true’; 0 = article rated as ‘false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’) as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: treatment dummy (1 = treatment group; 0 = control group), education (1 = no high school degree; 2 = high school degree; 3 = associates degree; 4 = bachelors degree; 5 = masters degree; 6 = doctorate degree), age, income (0 = US$0–50,000; 1 = US$50,000–100,000; 2 = US$100,000–150,000; 3 = US$150,000+), gender (1 = self-identify as female; 0 = self-identify as not female) and ideology (−3 = extremely liberal; −2 = liberal; −1 = slightly liberal; 0 = moderate; 1 = slightly conservative; 2 = conservative; 3 = extremely conservative). A full description of our variables used in studies 1–4 and study 5 is provided in Supplementary Information I and J. We also stated that we would repeat the main analysis using seven-point ordinal form (1,: definitely false to 7, definitely true) in addition to our categorical dummy variable. Our key prediction stated that the treatment—encouraging individuals to search online—would increase belief in misinformation, which is the hypothesis tested in this study.\n\nHowever, such an analysis does not account for the likely heterogenous treatment effect across articles evaluated or whether the respondent was ideologically congruent to the perspective of the article. Given this, we deviated from our preregistered plan on two distinct points: (1) to control for the likely heterogeneity in our treatment effect across articles, we add article fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at the article level45 in addition to at the individual level; and (2) we replace the ideology variable with a dummy variable that accounts for whether an individual’s ideological perspective is congruent with the article’s perspective. Given that the congruence of one’s ideological perspective with that of the article, and not ideology per se, likely affects belief in misinformation, we think that this is the proper variable to use. Although we deviate from these aspects of the preregistered analysis, the results for studies 1–4 using this preregistered model are provided in Extended Data Fig. 8. The results from these models support the hypothesis even more strongly than the results that we present in the main text of this paper.\n\nArticle-selection process\n\nTo distribute a representative sample of highly popular news articles directly after publication to respondents, we created a transparent, replicable and preregistered article-selection process that sourced highly popular false/misleading and true articles from across the ideological spectrum to be evaluated by respondents within 24–48 h of their publication. In study 4 (in which we sent only articles about COVID-19 to respondents), we delayed sending the articles to respondents for an additional 24 h to enable us to receive the assessment from our professional fact-checkers before sending the articles out to respondents. Doing so enabled us to communicate fact-checker assessments to respondents once they had completed their own assessment, therefore reducing the chance of causing medical harm by misinforming a survey participant about the pandemic.\n\nWe sourced one article per day from each of the following five news streams: liberal mainstream news domains; conservative mainstream news domains; liberal low-quality news domains; conservative low-quality news domains; and low-quality news domains with no clear political orientation. Each day, we chose the most popular online articles from these five streams that had appeared in the previous 24 h and sent them to respondents who were recruited either through Qualtrics (studies 1–4) or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (study 5). An explanation of our sampling technique on Qualtrics and Mechanical Turk, why we chose the services and why we believe that these results can be generalized is provided in Supplementary Information D. Collecting and distributing the most popular false articles directly after publication is a key innovation that enabled us to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation during the period in which people are most likely to consume it. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication.\n\nTo generate our streams of mainstream news, we collected the top 100 news sites by US consumption identified by Microsoft Research’s Project Ratio between 2016 and 2019. To classify these websites as liberal or conservative, we used scores of media partisanship from a previous study46, which assigns ideological estimates to websites on the basis of the URL-sharing behaviour of social media users: websites with a score of below zero were classified as liberal and those above zero were classified as conservative. The top ten websites in each group (liberal or conservative) by consumption were then chosen to create a liberal mainstream and conservative mainstream news feed. For our low-quality news sources, we relied on the list of low-quality news sources from a previous study3 that were still active at the start of our study in November 2019. We subsequently classified all low-quality sources into three streams: liberal leaning sources, conservative leaning sources and those with no clear partisan orientation. The list of the sources in all five streams, as well as an explanation for how the ideology for low-quality sources was determined, is provided in Supplementary Information E (Supplementary Tables 67–71).\n\nOn each day of studies 1, 2 and 5, we selected the most popular article from the past 24 h. We used CrowdTangle, a content discovery and social monitoring platform that tracks the popularity of URLs on Facebook pages, for the mainstream sources, and RSS feeds, for the low-quality sources, from each of the five streams. We used RSS feeds for the low-quality sources instead of CrowdTangle because the Facebook pages of most low-quality sources had been banned and were therefore not tracked by CrowdTangle. Articles chosen by this algorithm therefore represent the most popular credible and low-quality news from across the ideological spectrum. The number of public Twitter (recently renamed X) posts and public Facebook group posts that contained each article in studies 1, 2 and 3 is provided in Supplementary Tables 72 and 73 in Supplementary Information G. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication. In study 4, to test whether this search effect is robust to news stories related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we sampled only the most popular articles of which the central claim covered the health, economic, political or social effects of COVID-19. During study 4 and 5, we also added a list of low-quality news sources known to publish pandemic-related misinformation, which was compiled by NewsGuard.\n\nIt is important to note that we are testing the search effect during the time period in which our studies run (from study 1 in late 2019 to study 5 in late 2021). It is possible that, over time, the online information environment may change as the result of new search strategies and/or search algorithms.\n\nSurveys\n\nIn each study, we sent out an online survey that asked respondents a battery of questions related to the daily articles that had been selected by our article-selection protocol, as well as a litany of demographic questions. While they completed the survey within the Qualtrics platform, they viewed the articles directly on the website where they had been originally published. Respondents evaluated each article using a variety of criteria, the most germane of which was a categorical evaluation question: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” to which respondents could choose from three responses: (1) true; (2) misleading/false; and (3) could not determine. The respondents were also asked to assess the accuracy of the news article on a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (definitely not true) to 7 (definitely true). In study 5, we also asked the respondents to evaluate articles based on a four-point ordinal scale: “to the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the central claim in the article?” (1) Not at all accurate; (2) not very accurate; (3) somewhat accurate; and (4) Very accurate.\n\nWe ran our analyses using both categorical responses and the ordinal scale(s). To assess the reliability and validity of both measures, we predict the rating of an article on a seven-point scale using a dummy variable measuring whether that respondent rated that article as true on the categorical measure using a simple linear regression. We found that, across each study, rating an article as true on average increases the veracity scale rating on average by 2.75 points on the seven-point scale (approximately 1.5 s.d. of the ratings on the ordinal scale). The full results are shown in Extended Data Fig. 9. To ensure that responses that we use were actually from respondents who evaluated articles in good faith, two relatively simple attention checks for each article, which do not depend on any ability associated with the evaluation task, were used. If a respondent failed any of these attention checks, all of their evaluations were omitted from this analysis. These attention check questions can be found in Supplementary Information F.\n\nDetermining the veracity of articles\n\nOne of the key challenges in this study was determining the veracity of the article in the period directly after publication. Whereas many studies use source quality as a proxy for article quality, not all articles from suspect news sites are actually false3. Other studies have relied on professional fact-checking organizations such as Snopes or Politifact to identify false/misleading stories from these sources47,48. However, the use of evaluations from these organization is impossible when sourcing articles in real time because we have no way of knowing whether these articles will ever be checked by such organizations. As an alternative evaluation mechanism, we hired six professional fact checkers from leading national media organizations to also assess each article during the same 24 h period as respondents. In studies 4 and 5, given the onset of the pandemic and the potential harm caused by medical misinformation, the professional fact-checkers rated the articles 24 h before the respondents so that we could show respondents the fact-checkers’ ratings of each article immediately after completion of the survey. These professional fact-checkers were recruited from a diverse group of reputable publications (none of the fact-checkers were employed by a publication included in our studies to ensure no conflicts of interest) and were paid US$10.00 per article. The modal response of the professional fact checkers yielded 37 false/misleading, 102 true and 16 indeterminate articles from study 1. Most articles were evaluated by five fact-checkers; a few were evaluated by four or six. A different group of six fact-checkers evaluated all of the articles during studies 4 and 5 relative to studies 1–3. We use the modal response of the professional fact checkers to determine whether we code an article as ‘true’, ’false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’. We are then able to assess the ability of our respondents to identify the veracity of an article by comparing their response to the modal professional fact checker response. In terms of inter-rater reliability among fact-checkers, we report a Fleiss’ Kappa score of 0.42 for all fact-checker evaluations of articles used in this paper. We also report the article-level agreement between each pair of fact-checkers and average weighted Cohen kappa score between each pair of fact-checkers in Supplementary Table 74 in Supplementary Information K. These scores are reported for the articles that were rated by five professional fact-checkers. Although this level of agreement is quite low, it is slightly higher than other studies that have used professional fact-checkers to rate the veracity of both credible and suspect articles using similar scale our fact-checkers used49. This low level of agreement of professionals over what is misinformation may also explain why so many respondents believe misinformation and why searching online does not effectively reduce this problem. Identifying misinformation is a difficult task, even for professionals.\n\nWe also present all of the analyses in this paper using only false/misleading articles with a robust mode—which we define as any modal response of fact-checkers that would not change if one professional fact-checker changed their response—to remove articles where there was higher levels of disagreement among professional fact-checkers. These results can be found in Supplementary Table 74 Supplementary Information K. We found that the direction of our results does not change when using the false/misleading articles with a robust mode, although the effect is no longer statistically significant for 2 out of the 4 studies using the categorical measure and 1 out of the 4 studies using the continuous measure. To determine whether the search effect changes with the rate of agreement of fact-checkers, we ran an interaction model and present the results in Extended Data Fig. 10. We found that the search effect does appear to weaken for articles that fact-checkers most agree are false/misleading. Put another way, the search effect is strongest for articles in which there is less fact-checker agreement that the article is false, suggesting that online search may be especially ineffective when the veracity of articles is most difficult to ascertain. Although this is the case, the search effect for only false/misleading articles with a robust mode (one fact-checker changing their decision from false/misleading to true will not change the modal fact-checker evaluation) is still quite consistent and strong. These results are presented in Supplementary Figs. 2–5 in Supplementary Information M.\n\nStudy 1\n\nIn study 1, we tested whether SOTEN affects belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran for 10 days. During this study, we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window, but asked only one of the groups to do this after searching online. We preregistered a hypothesis that both false/misleading and true news were more likely to be rated as true by those who were encouraged to search online. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nOn ten separate days (21 November 2019 to 7 January 2020), we randomly assigned a group of respondents to be encouraged to search online before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity. Over these 10 days, 13 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not requested to search online (resulting in 1,145 evaluations from 876 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were requested to search online (resulting in 1,130 evaluations from 872 unique respondents). The articles used during this study can be found in Supplementary Tables 1–5 in Supplementary Information A.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. We then presented the participants with three out of five articles selected that day randomly (no articles could be shown to a respondent more than once). For each article, the respondents in each group were asked a series questions about the article, such as whether it is an opinion article, their interest in the article, and their perceived reliability of the source. Those in the control group were presented with the veracity questions most relevant to this study: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” with the following options: (1) true: the central claim you are evaluating is factually accurate. (2) Misleading and/or false: misleading: the central claim takes out of context, misrepresents or omits evidence. False: the central claim is factually inaccurate. (3) Could not determine: you do not feel you can judge whether the central claim is true, false or misleading. The participants were also asked a seven-point ordinal scale veracity question: “now that you have evaluated the article, we are interested in the strength of your opinion. Please rank the article on the following scale: 1 (definitely not true), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (definitely true)”. Differing from the control group, the participants in the treatment group (encouraged to search for additional information) were given instructions before these two veracity questions (see below). These instructions encouraged them to search online and asked the respondents questions about their search online.\n\nInstructions to find evidence to evaluate central claim\n\nThe following instructions were provided to respondents in studies 1–5 before SOTEN.\n\n“The purpose of this section is to find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating. This evidence should allow you to assess whether the central claim is true, false or somewhere in between. Guidance for the finding evidence for or against the central claim you’ve identified:\n\n(1)\n\nBy evidence, we mean an article, statement, photo, video, audio or statistic relevant to the central claim. This evidence should be reported by some other source than the author of the article you are investigating. This evidence can either support the initial claim or go against it.\n\n(2)\n\nTo find evidence about the claim, you should use a keyword search on a search engine of your choice or within the website of a particular source you trust as an authority on the topic related to the claim you’re evaluating.\n\n(3)\n\nWe ask that you use the highest-quality pieces of evidence to evaluate the central claim in your search. If you cannot find evidence about the claim from a source that you trust, you should try to find the most relevant evidence about the claim you can find from any source, even one you don’t trust.\n\nFor additional instructions explaining how to find evidence please click this text” (these additional instructions are provided in Supplementary Information H, and the instructions that we gave respondents for the extra study omitting some instructions are provided in Supplementary Information O).\n\nWe next presented respondents with the following four questions:\n\n(1)\n\nWhat are the keywords you used to research this original claim? If you searched multiple times, enter just the keywords you used on your final/successful search. If you used a reverse image search, please enter “reverse image search” in the text box.\n\n(2)\n\nWhich of the following best describes the highest quality evidence you found about the claim in your search? Possible responses: (A) I found evidence from a source that I trust. (B) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t know enough about to trust or distrust. (C) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t trust. (D) I did not find evidence about this claim.\n\n(3)\n\nEvidence link: please paste the link for the highest quality evidence you found (paste only the text of the URL link here. Do not include additional text from the webpage/article, etc.). If you did not find any evidence, please type the following phrase in the text box below: “No Evidence”.\n\n(4)\n\nAdditional evidence links: if you use other different evidence sources that are particularly helpful, please paste the additional sources here.\n\nAfter the participants read the instructions and were asked these questions about their online search, those in the treatment group were presented with the two veracity questions of interest (categorical and seven-point ordinal scale). In both the control and treatment conditions, the response options were listed in the same order as they are listed in this section.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was preregistered (https://osf.io/akemx/).\n\nBalance table\n\nSupplementary Table 95 in Supplementary Information Q compares basic demographic variables among respondents in the control and treatment group. This table shows that respondents were similar across demographic variables, except for income. Those in the control group self-reported making higher levels of income than those in the treatment group. We did not record the data for 83.2% of those who entered the survey and were in the control group and 85.8% of those in the treatment group. The majority of respondents dropped out of the survey at the beginning. About 66% of all respondents who entered the survey refused to consent or did not move past the first two consent questions. Taken together, of all of the respondents who moved past the consent questions, 51% of respondents dropped out of the survey in the control group and 58% of the respondents dropped out of the survey in the treatment group. About 11% of those who did not complete the survey did so because they failed the attention checks and were removed from the survey.\n\nStudy 2\n\nStudy 2 ran similarly to study 1, but over 29 days between 18 November 2019 and 6 February 2020. In each survey that was sent in study 1, we asked respondents in the control group to evaluate the third article they received a second time, but only after looking for evidence online (using the same directions to search online that participants in study 1 received).\n\nThis study measures the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation but, instead of running a between-respondent random control trial, we run a within-respondent study. In this study, the participants first evaluated articles without being encouraged to search online. After providing their veracity evaluation on both the categorical and ordinal scales, they were encouraged to search online to help them re-evaluate the article’s veracity using the same instructions as from study 1. This is probably a more difficult test of the effect of searching online, as individuals have already anchored themselves to their previous response. Literature on confirmation bias leads us to believe that new information will have the largest effect when individuals have not already evaluated the news article on its own. Thus study therefore enables us to measure whether the effect of searching online is strong enough to change an individual’s evaluation of a news article after they have evaluated the article on its own. We did not preregister a hypothesis, but we did pose this as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nDuring study 2, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,054 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 96 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nSimilar to study 1, respondents initially evaluated articles as if they were in the control group, but after they finished their evaluation they were then presented with this text: “Now that you have evaluated the article, we would like you evaluate the article again, but this time find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating”. They were then prompted with the same instructions and questions as the treatment group in study 1.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was posed as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1.\n\nStudy 3\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 3, this study replicated study 2 using the same materials and procedure, but was run between 16 March 2020 and 28 April 2020, 3–5 months after the publication of each these articles. This study set out to test whether this search effect remained largely the same months after the publication of misinformation when professional fact-checks and other credible reporting on the topic are hopefully more prevalent. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nIn total, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,011 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 97 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 4\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 4, this study extended study 2 by asking individuals to evaluate and re-evaluate highly popular misinformation strictly about COVID-19 after searching online. This study was run over 8 days between 28 May 2020 to 22 June 2020. In the ‘Article-selection process’ section, we describe the changes that we made in our article-selection process to collect these articles. We collected these articles and sent them out to be evaluated by respondents. This study measured whether the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation still holds for misinformation about a salient event, in this case the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511). This IRB submission is the same as the one used for studies 1, 2 and 3, but it was modified and approved in May 2020 before we sent out articles related to COVID-19.\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nA total of 13 false or misleading unique articles was evaluated and re-evaluated by 386 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online (the treatment) and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 13–17 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 98 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 5\n\nTo test the effect of exposure to unreliable news on belief in misinformation, we ran a fifth and final study that combined survey and digital trace data. This study was almost identical to study 1, but we used a custom plug-in to collect digital trace data and encouraged the respondents to specifically search online using Google (our web browser plug-in could collect search results only from a Google search result page). Similar to study 1, we measured the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran on 12 separate days from 13 July 2021 to 9 November 2021, during which we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was encouraged to search online, while the control group was not. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2021-5608).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nUnlike the other four studies, these respondents were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Only workers within the United States (verified by IP address) and those with above a 95% success rate were allowed to participate. We were unable to recruit a representative sample of Americans using sampling quotas owing to the difficulty of recruiting respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk who were willing to install a web-tracking browser extension in the 24 h period after our algorithm selected articles to be evaluated.\n\nOver 12 days during study 5, a group of respondents were encouraged to SOTEN before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity (treatment) and another group was not encouraged to search online when they evaluated these articles (control). A total of 17 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not encouraged to search online (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were encouraged to search online (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents). The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 18–22 in Supplementary Information A. We do not find statistically significant evidence that respondents who we were recruited to the control group were different on a number of demographic variables. Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q compares those in the treatment and control group. Only 20% of those in the control group who consented to participate in the survey dropped out of the study, whereas 62% of those who entered the survey and were in the treatment group dropped out of the study. This difference in compliance rates can be explained by the difference in the web extension for the treatment group relative to the one given to the control group. For technical reasons related to capturing HTML, the respondents in the treatment group had to wait at least 5 s for the web extension that was installed to collect their Google search engine results, which may have resulted in some respondents accidentally removing the web extension. If they did not wait for 5 s on a Google search results page, the extension would turn off and they would have to turn it back on. These instructions were presented clearly to the respondents, but probably resulted in differences in compliance. This differential attrition does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey in the treatment and control group as shown in Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. Those assigned to the treatment group were then asked to install a web extension that would collect their digital trace data including their Google search history. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. To evaluate these news articles we will ask you to search online using Google about each news article online and then use Google Search results to help you evaluate the news articles. We need you to install the web extension and then search on Google for relevant information pertaining to each article in order for us to compensate you”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate the “Search Engine Results Saver”, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-engine-results-sav/mjdfiochiimhfgbdgkielodbojlpfcbl?hl=en&authuser=2). Those assigned to the control group were also asked to install a web extension that collected their digital trace data, but not any search engine results. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. You must install the extension, log in and keep this extension on for the whole survey to be fully compensated”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate URL Historian, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-historian/imdfbahhoamgbblienjdoeafphlngdim). Both those in the control and treatment group were asked to download and install a web extension that tracked their web behaviour to limit varying levels of attrition across both groups, due to the unwillingness or inability of respondents to install this kind of extension. After the respondents downloaded their respective web extension, the study ran identical to study 1.\n\nDigital trace data\n\nBy asking individuals to download and activate web browsers that collected their URL history and scraped their search engine results, we were able to measure the quality of news they were exposed to when they searched online. We were unable to collect this data if respondents did not search on Google, deactivated their web browser while they were taking the survey, or did not wait on a search engine result page for at least 5 s. Thus, in total for the 653 evaluations of misinformation in our treatment group, we collected Google search results for 508 evaluations (78% of all evaluations). We also collected the URL history of those in the control group, but did not use these data in our analyses. For most demographic characteristics (age, gender, income and education), we have statistically significant evidence that respondents from whom we were able to collect search engine results were slightly different compared with those from whom we were not able to collect these results. We find that participants from whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.8 on a seven-point scale, more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy and less likely to self-identify as female. Supplementary Table 100 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the treatment group. Those compliant in the treatment group were slightly younger by two and a half years and slightly more likely to be male.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nWhen we analysed the effect of the quality of online information, we included only those in the control group who kept their web extension on during the survey to limit possible selection bias effects. In the control group, 93% of the respondents evaluated a false/misleading article in the control group installed the web extension that tracked their own digital trace data throughout the whole survey. Similar to the treatment group, we do find that those for whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.55 on a seven-point scale and more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy. The magnitude of these differences are modest and the direction of these differences are identical to the differences in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 101 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the control group. We do not see large differences in how those who are compliant in the control group differ from those who are compliant in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 102 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying individuals in the treatment and control groups.\n\nTo measure the quality of search results, we use scores from Newsguard, an internet plug-in that informs users whether a site that they are viewing is reliable. NewsGuard employs a team of trained journalists and experienced editors to review and rate news and information websites based on nine criteria. The criteria assess basic practices of journalistic credibility and transparency, assigning a score from 0 to 100. Sites with a score below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score of above 60 are deemed to be reliable. NewsGuard has ratings for over 5,000 online news domains, responsible for about 95% of all the news consumed in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy. More information is available online (https://www.newsguardtech.com). A sample of their ratings can be found online (https://www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/sample-nutrition-labels/). The full list of online news domains and their ratings is licensed by NewsGuard to approved researchers.\n\nStudy 6\n\nStudy 6 tests whether the search effects that we identify on belief in false/misleading and true articles still hold when we change the instructions we present to respondents. To this end, we ran an experiment similar to study 1, but we added two other treatment arms in which we encouraged individuals to search online to evaluate news. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nEthics\n\nWe complied with all relevant ethical regulations. All of the studies were reviewed and approved by the NYU Institutional Review Board (IRB). Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 were approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-351. Study 5 was approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2021-5608. Study 6 was approved by a modified NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-3511. All of the experimental participants provided informed consent before taking part. The participants were given the option to withdraw from the study while the experiment was ongoing as well as to withdraw their data at any time.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/scicheck-what-weve-learned-about-so-called-lockdowns-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/', 'Headline': ""What We've Learned About So-Called 'Lockdowns' and the COVID-19 ..."", 'Snippet': 'Herby, Jonas et al. “A Literature Review and Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Lockdowns on COVID-19 Mortality.” Studies in Applied Economics, Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and ...', 'Full_text': ""The working paper calculates mortality impact estimates for each of the seven studies aiming to show the effect of the average mandated restrictions in Europe and the United States early in the pandemic compared with a policy of only recommendations. The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

But the government is not planning to implement mask mandates or “lockdowns,” despite claims from the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n\nFull Story\n\nIn recent weeks, COVID-19 cases, as estimated from wastewater data, and COVID-19 hospitalizations have been on the rise in the U.S. This comes as the omicron variant EG.5, recently designated as a “variant of interest” by the World Health Organization, became the newly dominant variant in the country.\n\nThis has led some public health experts to suggest that some people — especially those at higher risk of severe COVID-19 — wear masks when out in public, and to be a bit more cautious about contracting the coronavirus.\n\nIn a few limited instances, colleges and companies have announced they will be requiring masks for the time being.\n\nBut contrary to many viral social media posts, there is no indication that any kind of government-ordered COVID-19 restrictions are about to begin.\n\nIn an Aug. 18 episode of “The Alex Jones Show,” the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed sources within the federal government told him “new lockdowns are coming.”\n\nSpecifically, he said a “high level manager” in the Transportation Security Administration told him that by mid-September, TSA and airport employees would be required to wear masks due to concerns over “the new variant in Canada.” By mid-October, everyone would have to wear masks on airplanes, he said. He added that the public should expect by December a return to “full COVID protocols.”\n\nJones then claimed that he called a source within Customs and Border Protection after hearing this, and the source allegedly told him to expect “COVID protocols” to begin rolling out in mid-September and to “get ready for a whole new rollout of what happened before.”\n\nThe episode was headlined on Jones’ website InfoWars as “Federal Officials Blow the Whistle on Biden’s Plan for New COVID Lockdowns.”\n\nJones is best known for his false claim that the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 was fake. Last fall, he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamatory damages to the families of the victims as a result of his falsehoods. Jones is also a prolific spreader of COVID-19 misinformation, among other topics.\n\nClips of Jones’ show began circulating online, and dubious websites such as the Gateway Pundit, which frequently traffics in misinformation, and others reported on the “news,” helping to spread the claims on social media. An associated rallying cry, “do not comply,” briefly trended on X, the platform previously known as Twitter. Others have since repeated the claims.\n\nWhether from Jones or not, the rumor that COVID-19 restrictions might be coming back has since been picked up by some politicians.\n\n“If bureaucrats try to reinstate any COVID tyranny measures, resist them with a vengeance,” tweeted Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky on Aug. 25. “Do not comply.”\n\nNo Basis for Returning COVID-19 Restrictions\n\nA TSA spokesperson denied Jones’ claims, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — not TSA — is the federal agency responsible for transportation mask requirements.\n\n“TSA is unaware of such a requirement,” the spokesperson told us in an email. “There was no TSA meeting on the topic.”\n\nThe CDC similarly said the claims were untrue. “These rumors are utterly false,” Nick Spinelli, a CDC spokesperson, told us in an email.\n\nMoreover, all the talk of the Biden administration reimposing “lockdowns” is not even legally feasible. “The restrictions that were put into place on businesses, on going to the movie theater, on going to the retail mall … all of those were done by states and local governments, not the federal government,” Wendy E. Parmet, a public health law expert at Northeastern University, told us in a phone interview.\n\nThe federal government did advise states on restrictions, including when to lift them, and guided Americans on what they should and should not do to stay safe. But ultimately, these were just suggestions.\n\n“It’s conspiracy thinking and it’s catastrophizing,” Parmet said of Jones’ claims.\n\nParmet added that the restrictions in the U.S., which included business closures and limits on gathering sizes, were not true lockdowns, such as those imposed in China. “The ‘lockdown’ terminology is certainly a misnomer,” she said.\n\nParmet said that legally, TSA probably could impose mask mandates on its employees, but those would not extend to all airport workers or to passengers. That would be a “labor law issue,” she said, and there might be pushback from the union.\n\nThe CDC’s ability to impose a face mask mandate during travel has been contested in court. (Parmet is one of many public health and public health law experts who signed an amicus brief supporting the CDC on this issue.)\n\nThe CDC’s previous order expired due to the end of the public health emergency in May and had already become unenforceable in April 2022 due to a court order.\n\n“I think CDC would be extremely wary, and I suspect that the Biden administration will be exceptionally wary right now … for both litigation and political reasons to go down that route unless they feel it is absolutely essential,” Parmet said.\n\nSpinelli noted that the CDC “continues to recommend that all people—passengers and transportation workers, alike—are up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines before they travel and take steps to protect yourself and others.” That can include wearing a mask, if you so choose, when using public transit — but it is not mandated.\n\nThe agency currently advises higher-risk people and their contacts to mask up when a person’s county-level hospital admission level is “medium.” When it’s “high,” everyone is advised to wear a high-quality mask or respirator, such as an N95, and higher-risk people are advised to avoid “non-essential indoor activities in public.” But again, these are just recommendations.\n\nAs of Aug. 12, no counties are listed as “high,” and fewer than 3% are “medium.”\n\nSome experts have criticized tying public health recommendations to hospital admissions, as this is a lagging indicator, and the warning to take more precautions may come too late for many people.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection did not respond to an inquiry about Jones’ claims with any information by the time of publication.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 28: CBP told us the agency follows CDC guidelines and that “[c]laims that CBP has plans to independently reintroduce COVID-19 protocols are false.”\n\nSome Concern from New Variants, But No Expectation of a Return to 2020\n\nScientists and public health officials have been watching two newer coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, variants: EG.5 and BA.2.86.\n\nEG.5, which the CDC estimates made up about a fifth of all coronavirus cases in the U.S. in the past couple of weeks, is a spinoff of XBB.1.9.2, another omicron variant. In this regard, it doesn’t appear to be that different from its immediate predecessors, although it may be a bit more transmissible and more readily able to evade immunity, which could explain its current rise. There isn’t evidence that the variant causes more severe disease.\n\n“Collectively, available evidence does not suggest that EG.5 has additional public health risks relative to the other currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 descendent lineages,” the WHO concluded in an Aug. 9 risk evaluation report.\n\nAn updated COVID-19 booster, which targets the XBB.1.5 variant, is expected to be available in late September or early October. Because EG.5 is quite similar to XBB.1.5, experts anticipate that the updated vaccine will provide good protection against this variant.\n\nThe other variant, BA.2.86, is an omicron descendant, but has many more mutations that make it considerably different. As Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, put it on X, its high number of mutations “makes it an evolutionary jump comparable in size to that which originally gave rise to Omicron.”\n\nOnly a small number of BA.2.86 cases have been identified in the U.S. or elsewhere, but mutation analyses indicate the variant may be especially able to evade immune defenses. It is still too soon to know whether the variant causes more severe disease or is more transmissible, according to the CDC. The variant, however, has been identified in many countries, suggesting it has some ability to spread.\n\nEven if BA.2.86 does turn out to be the next big variant, it would not be the same as 2020, when the entire world was susceptible to the coronavirus, with no kind of prior immunity and no vaccine available.\n\nThe forthcoming updated vaccine may be less effective against BA.2.86 than against other variants, but the CDC expects it will still work to reduce severe disease and hospitalization, which is the primary goal. This makes it highly unlikely that the U.S. would have to impose restrictions similar to those early in the pandemic, even if there is a bad COVID-19 surge and public health officials encourage people to take extra precautions.\n\n“We aren’t returning to March 2020; our immune systems will still recognize the highly mutated variant, albeit suboptimally,” epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina wrote in her Substack about the possible risks of BA.2.86. “This will protect a lot of us from severe disease.”\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s articles providing accurate health information and correcting health misinformation are made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Hanke\n\nhttps://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Perspectives-_1_Did-lockdowns-work__June_web.pdf\n\nAbstract\n\nThe purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the effect of lockdowns, also referred to as ‘Covid restrictions’, ‘social distancing measures’ etc., on COVID-19 mortality based on available empirical evidence. We define lockdowns as the imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). We employ a systematic search and screening procedure in which 19,646 studies are identified that could potentially address the purpose of our study. After three levels of screening, 32 studies qualified. Of those, estimates from 22 studies could be converted to standardised measures for inclusion in the metaanalysis.\n\nThey are separated into three groups: lockdown stringency index studies, shelter-in-place-order (SIPO) studies, and specific NPI studies. Stringency index studies find that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 3.2 per cent. This translates into approximately 6,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 4,000 in the United States. SIPOs were also relatively ineffective in the spring of 2020, only reducing COVID-19 mortality by 2.0 per cent. This translates into approximately 4,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 3,000 in the United States. Based on specific NPIs, we estimate that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 reduced COVID-19 mortality by 10.7 per cent. This translates into approximately 23,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 16,000 in the United States. In comparison, there are approximately 72,000 flu deaths in Europe and 38,000 flu deaths in the United States each year. When checked for potential biases, our results are robust. Our results are also supported by the natural experiments we have been able to identify. The results of our meta-analysis support the conclusion that lockdowns in the spring of 2020 had a negligible effect on COVID-19 mortality. This result is consistent with the view that voluntary changes in behaviour, such as social distancing, did play an important role in mitigating the pandemic.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Herby-Jonung-Hanke meta-analysis found that lockdowns, as reported in studies based on stringency indices in the spring of 2020, reduced mortality by 3.2 per cent when compared to less strict lockdown policies adopted by the likes of Sweden\n\nThis means lockdowns prevented 1,700 deaths in England and Wales, 6,000 deaths across Europe, and 4,000 deaths in the United States.\n\nLockdowns prevented relatively few deaths compared to a typical flu season – in England and Wales, 18,500–24,800 flu deaths occur, in Europe 72,000 flu deaths occur, and in the United States 38,000 flu deaths occur in a typical flu season\n\nThese results pale in comparison to the Imperial College of London’s modelling exercises (March 2020), which predicted that lockdowns would save over 400,000 lives in the United Kingdom and over 2 million lives in the United States\n\nHerby, Jonung, and Hanke conclude that voluntary changes in behaviour, such as social distancing, played a significant role in mitigating the pandemic – but harsher restrictions, like stay-at-home rules and school closures, generated very high costs but produced only negligible health benefits\n\nCOVID-19 lockdowns were “a global policy failure of gigantic proportions,” according to this peer-reviewed new academic study. The draconian policy failed to significantly reduce deaths while imposing substantial social, cultural, and economic costs.\n\nThe comprehensive 220-page book, began with a systematic review of 19,646 potentially relevant studies. For their meta-analysis, the authors’ screening resulted in the choice of 22 studies that are based on actual, measured mortality data, not on results derived from modelling exercises. A meta-analysis is considered the ‘gold-standard’ for evidence, as it combines comparable, independent studies to determine overall trends.\n\nThe authors, including Professor Steve H. Hanke of the Johns Hopkins University, also consider a range of studies that determined the impact of individual lockdown restrictions, including stay at-home rules to school closures and travel restrictions.\n\nIn each case, the restrictions did little to reduce COVID-19 mortality:\n\nShelter-in-place (stay at home) orders in Europe and the United States reduced COVID mortality by between 1.4 and 4.1 per cent;\n\nBusiness closures reduced mortality by 7.5 per cent;\n\nGathering limits likely increased COVID mortality by almost six per cent;\n\nMask mandates, which most countries avoided in Spring 2020, reduced mortality by 18.7 per cent, particularly mandates in workplaces; and\n\nSchool closures resulted in a between 2.5 per cent and 6.2 per cent mortality reduction.\n\nA second approach employed by the authors to estimate the effects of lockdowns on mortality combined studies that looked at specific lockdown measures (such as school closures, mask wearing, etc.) on how single non-pharmaceutical interventions were actually used in Europe and the United States. Using this approach, the authors estimate that lockdowns reduced mortality by 10.7 per cent in the spring of 2020 – significantly less than estimates produced by epidemiological modelling.\n\nThe study compares the effect of lockdown measures against the effect of ‘doing the least,’ rather than doing nothing at all. Sweden’s response to COVID was among the least stringent in Europe, but still imposed some legal restrictions and included an extensive public information campaign.\n\nYou can read the press release for the book here.\n\nFullscreen Mode'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://health.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2022-02-02/a-johns-hopkins-study-says-ill-founded-lockdowns-did-little-to-limit-covid-deaths', 'Headline': ""A Johns Hopkins study says 'ill-founded' COVID lockdowns did more harm ..."", 'Snippet': 'Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have concluded that lockdowns have done little to reduce COVID deaths but have had “devastating effects” on economies and numerous social ills.

Scientists and health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health have been lying about COVID-19 the entire time, they say.\n\n""When the talking heads come out and say that we can ease up on restrictions because ‘The science is changing’ understand that the science never supported any of their measures all along,"" said one viral post by a chiropractor who has made false claims about the pandemic in the past.

Changing guidelines impact people’s daily lives. But the claims ignore the realities and challenges presented by a global pandemic caused by an emerging virus, researchers and science experts told us.\n\nScientists and doctors are worn down by the narrative.\n\n""These kinds of charges are frustrating,"" said Sarah Richardson, a science historian at Harvard University. ""They reflect a misunderstanding of how science works, how public health policy is created, and how empirical science and public health policy relate to one another.""\n\nScientific findings are often confusing and conflicting. But evolving research and changing guidelines aren’t unprecedented or shocking, nor are they indicative of something nefarious.\n\n""I can hardly blame people for feeling confused, but the problem is how this has been used politically,"" said Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.

Scientists analyze samples for genetic changes, watching for mutations. (AP)\n\nScience is hard. COVID-19 made it harder. One reason is simply the unusually lengthy timeline of this pandemic.\n\nMost traditional epidemics run though communities over intervals of several months, said Dr. David Jones, an epidemiology professor at Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health and professor of the culture of medicine at the university’s history of science department.\n\n""Too short of a time for researchers to launch and analyze studies that could have changed their thinking,"" he said.\n\nThe scientific process takes time. It involves a series of observations and hypotheses that are followed up with tests and experiments that are tweaked and fine-tuned along the way. Heading into three years of COVID-19, it’s to be expected that scientific consensus — when it can be achieved — would change. When you add in a rapidly-evolving virus like SARS-CoV-2 which has impacted vaccine efficacy and the need for boosters, things get more complicated.\n\n""Someone has an observation, they do a study to test it, they learn something about it. And, as we learn more over time, we find out nuances,"" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director at the American Public Health Association. ""With COVID-19, we didn\'t have a static physical or biological object. It has been changing rapidly and we are altering the research along with it. The facts of the science haven\'t changed, the experiments and the virus have.""\n\nAs scientists did their work, thousands were dying every day. Public health officials still had to give guidance with the goal of trying to keep as many people as safe as possible.\n\nThere were so many mysteries to solve when SARS-CoV-2 first emerged. No. 1: How was it transmitted? At first, many scientists believed, wrongly in hindsight, that it would behave similarly to SARS, a coronavirus that caused an outbreak in 2003. That virus, formally called SARS-CoV-1, caused an outbreak that lasted a short period. This is due, in part, to the fact that asymptomatic people could not spread it.\n\nWith its asymptomatic spread, COVID-19 turned out to be to SARS what a fox is to a dog, Goldman said: ""They\'re both canines, but they’re very different animals.""\n\nThere was no handbook for this new virus.\n\n""Even just logically giving advice on how other members of the very same family of coronaviruses — a lot of that didn’t work,"" Goldman said. ""Controlling those viruses is completely different from controlling COVID. But I think people tried very hard to do everything they could to save lives.""\n\nAmong pandemics in history, COVID-19 stands alone. But experts said the 1918 influenza pandemic provides a good example of how scientific understanding develops in such a crisis.\n\nThe 1918 pandemic had three main waves spanning one to two years. Scientists kept trying to identify its cause. At the time, they believed that a number of bacteria were responsible for the outbreak, only to discover years later in the 1930s that the cause was a virus.\n\nBut the scientists who had incorrectly proposed a bacterial origin weren’t ""lying,"" experts said. They were doing hard science in a crisis setting with inadequate tools, which can lead to wrong answers.\n\nIt’s also important to acknowledge the role that interest groups play in challenging what are sometimes unpopular scientific findings. There is a long history, going back to tobacco in the 1950s or climate change in the 1980s, where interest groups highlighted the imperfections of the scientific process in order to advance their own interests.\n\nScience is easy to critique as studies vary in terms of scale and robustness, Jones said. If science is used to regulate interests that profit from lack of regulation, it makes sense that those groups would characterize the scientists as liars.\n\n""Messaging from the CDC and NIH has left a lot to be desired, and political interests shape it, but that doesn’t mean that Fauci was ‘lying,’"" Jones said.\n\nConfusion over masks\n\nKindergarten teacher Karen Drolet, left, works with a student at Raices Dual Language Academy, a public school in Central Falls, R.I., Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2022. (AP)\n\nMask-wearing quickly became one of the most volatile aspects of the pandemic. Answers to questions about which masks to wear, where to wear them and who should wear them have fluctuated with time and understanding.\n\nBefore COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, Fauci advised the general public against wearing masks. This was due to initial confusion about how COVID-19 was transmitted and concerns about mask shortages for essential workers. When it became clear that there wouldn’t be a shortage and that public mask-wearing, along with social distancing, could greatly reduce transmission, recommendations changed.\n\nScientists still believe that masks are effective at preventing illness — that hasn’t changed. But public health guidance around masks has. That’s because scientific understanding has changed about what types of masks are most effective in the face of different COVID-19 variants and in different settings. Once used widely outside, masks are now known to be most useful indoors and in crowded spaces, where risk of transmission is far higher.\n\n""The first message of no masks was absolutely wrong, because (not wearing a) mask completely exposes you. Cloth masks that are multi-layered offer better protection, but the best is a well-fitting N95 mask,"" Benjamin said. ""But it’s a spectrum of protections, and we really need to talk about this in terms of risk and degrees of protection.""\n\nAlso at play in masking recommendations: rises and falls in infection rates and an upward trend in vaccination rates. With the CDC poised in late February to again revise its masking guidelines amid dropping COVID-19 infections, Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said it makes sense to think about masks as we think about raincoats.\n\n""You wear it when it\'s raining,"" he said in a Feb. 23 interview with NPR. ""You take it off when it stops raining. And if we think of masks in that way, then yeah, during surges, we should have masks, and everybody should be wearing them. And when the surge ends, we should take off our masks.""\n\nMasks have also been hard to study, experts said\n\nMasking can be ""highly context-specific,"" Harvard’s Richardson said: ""Are other people masking? Are they vaccinated and boosted? What kinds of masks? What is the level of transmission in the community? Are they mandated? Are other mitigation policies in place?""\n\nThe question gets more complicated when it’s about masking in schools.\n\n""Do mask mandates in elementary schools help? I suspect you could find scientific articles that have drawn different conclusions from their data,"" Jones said. ""This is in part because good science is hard to do — some studies might be methodologically better than others and therefore closer to the ‘right answer’ — in part because contexts matter. Was the study done in warm or cold weather? Were the students indoors for eight hours at a stretch, or for less time? etc. Will a clear answer ever emerge? I’m really not sure.""\n\nThese uncertainties are essential to the scientific process, but are like firewood for skeptics.\n\nThen there’s political pressure. As public sentiment about the pandemic shifts, we’ve seen a number of Democratic lawmakers take action to lift mask mandates and ease other restrictions.\n\nWhile politics most certainly plays a role in some of these decisions, criticism of those actions fails to recognize that the landscape looks different now than it did when these rules were put in place. Among the many new factors are vaccines, case declines, optimism over news of milder variants, and mounting public concern about mental health struggles.\n\n""Creating public health policy requires uniting a wide range of constituencies around a shared platform, weighing costs and benefits,"" Richardson said. ""This is a slow-moving process, embedded in our democratic systems of governance, with its own constraints and inertias.""\n\nPublic messaging errors\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021. (AP)\n\nPublic health officials have attempted to alter their messaging in response to the science, but the end result hasn’t always been very effective or clear.\n\n""If we could go back, I think people would have given a lot more caution in their responses,"" Benjamin said. ""I think we would\'ve seen officials say, ‘This is what we know today, but it may be different later.’ There would be a lot more humility and detailed explanations about why things change.""\n\nIt’s all had an impact on how Americans view science. A Pew Research Center survey published Feb. 15 found 29% of U.S. adults said they have a great deal of confidence in medical scientists to act in the best interests of the public, down from 40% in November 2020.\n\nAnd a 2021 study by sociologists at the University of New Hampshire found that 31% of Americans surveyed said they believe scientists ""adjust their findings to get the answer they want."" Another 16% weren’t sure.\n\nWhat seems to be behind that belief, according to the sociologists? A ""misunderstanding of scientific methods, uncertainty, and the incremental nature of scientific inquiry.""'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/10/opinions/covid-19-pandemic-lockdowns-sepkowitz/index.html', 'Headline': 'Opinion: No, Covid-19 lockdowns were not a mistake | CNN', 'Snippet': 'Responding to an excerpt from the book “The Big Fail,” which points to what the authors deem public health missteps during the Covid-19 pandemic — most notably lockdowns — Kent Sepkowitz ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: Kent Sepkowitz is a physician and infectious disease expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nAs the clear and present danger of the Covid-19 pandemic begins to fade, discussions and judgments have been swirling as to whether the various battlefield public health decisions to confront the crisis were effective.\n\nEarlier this year, an analysis of the efficacy of wearing a mask caused such an uproar that the estimable Cochrane Review issued a very unusual statement to clarify just what the article said (the study limitations were too great to conclude much) and didn’t say (masks don’t work, full stop).\n\nMore recently, a British government inquiry into the country’s day-to-day pandemic management has suggested that decisions (“over-confidence and lack of planning”) and attitude (“misogyny and lack of humanity in the government’s response”) were sorely lacking.\n\nAnd now, business reporters Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera have published a book, “The Big Fail,” excerpted in a New York Magazine article headlined: “Covid Lockdowns were a Giant Experiment. It was a Failure.” (Full disclosure: I have read only the magazine excerpt, not the full book.) Given this provocative title, it is unsurprising to find a withering assessment of the lockdowns used in the US and many other countries as a means to control Covid-19.\n\nThe authors make some good points: The lockdown dislocated students from schools and customers from places of business. Medical care was delayed for some (though needed surgeries continued when hospital beds were available). And, most dramatically, young students lost the educational and social advantage of a physical classroom. (As for the students, by some accounts, the academic impact seems to have been transient.)\n\nThey summarize the issue this way: “Did the many social, economic, and medical downsides make [lockdowns], in the aggregate, not worth whatever short-term benefits they might yield?” Their answer is a loud “no.”\n\nTo which I, having read the same dozens of primary articles they did, say: You bet it was worth it.\n\nYes, lockdown was a blunt instrument that caused a great deal of collateral damage. The difference between my view and theirs, I think, is that they consider the lockdown a single activity stretched across the entire pandemic; in contrast, I would distinguish the initial lockdown, which was crucial, from the off-and-on lockdowns as therapies, vaccines and overall care improved. There is an argument to be made that these were not anywhere near as effective.\n\nIn other words, I consider the “short-term benefits” to be absolutely critical in allowing the medical world to steady itself and gain a much firmer grasp of the task at hand. One only had to work in health care in New York City to see the difference between early 2020, when the explosion of cases overwhelmed the city, versus later in 2020 when an effective therapy had been identified, supplies and diagnostic testing had been greatly improved (though still completely inadequate) and the makeshift ICUs and emergency rooms had been set in place.\n\nIt was still a nightmare to be sure, but it was a vastly more organized nightmare.\n\nThe “short-term benefits” at the start of the pandemic are simple to characterize: Every infection that was delayed due to the lockdowns was a day to the good, a day closer to the release of the mRNA vaccines in December 2020, a less-hectic day for the health care workers, a day for clinical trials to mature. Therefore, the authors’ statement that lockdowns “were a mistake that should not be repeated” because they had no “purpose other than keeping hospitals from being overrun in the short-term” is to me a fundamental misunderstanding of the day-to-day work that was being done.\n\nMost disturbing to me about this assessment and the others that have come along are the minimal mention of the death and debility the infection caused. A reminder for those who have forgotten just how brutal the pandemic was: Worldwide there have been 7 million deaths. In the US, there have been more than a million deaths, millions have some post-infection debility and many health care workers remain profoundly demoralized.\n\nIn this context, many of the outcomes of concern listed by Nocera and McLean — suicidal thoughts in teens, alcoholism and drug use increases, violence — are as easily explained by this staggering death toll as by the cabin fever brought on by lockdowns. Once again: About 1 out of every 350 Americans died in the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnother way to consider the impact of so many deaths is examination of life expectancy. Of note, life expectancy in the US fell in 2020 (1.8 years) and 2021 (0.6 years), the sharpest drop since the 1920s; per the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 74% of the drop was attributed to Covid-19. This perspective makes a simple point for those who consider many deaths among the elderly and very elderly as sad but without larger societal implications. From the society perspective, if only the old and very old die, there should be little if any impact on life expectancy. To fall more than two years so precipitously requires the deaths of many in their 30s and 40s and 50s, as occurred with the first year of the pandemic.\n\nDespite endless studies, the debate about lockdowns will continue. The data is not clean. Real data — not prissy data from a generic randomized placebo controlled double-blind trial run by a pharma company with deep pockets (albeit with a desired outcome as well) — is never clean. Therefore, in its uncertainty there is room for all sorts of interpretations, crazy and not, and the issue will not be settled, though I agree that we must try.\n\nI do think that a practical conclusion that we may send to those caught up in a future pandemic of respiratory virus is this: Lock down hard and quickly until you and the world can get your bearings. Maintaining a functional health care system is crucial.\n\nThis of course shifts the hard debate to follow-up decisions. Once started, how quickly can one lift a lockdown? For me, this is the very unclear and very difficult problem and one that can frustrate an already overwhelmed public. The back and forth of the lockdown edicts seemed like more governmental dithering to many and requires a great deal of focused consideration.\n\nBut one large caveat to making the decisions that lie ahead: Historians — the tweedy tenured types — understand they stand at a safe remove from the events they are recounting. They acknowledge that being in the middle of total chaos is very different than writing about those who were in the middle of total chaos. The eminent historian Bernard Bailyn warned against the distortion this can impose: “The fact — the inescapable fact — is that we [historians] know how it all came out…and they [those involved in the events] did not.”\n\nTrue, those of us now giving our own analyses on the effectiveness of lockdowns lived through the pandemic. But still, we should consider context of the Covid reality that we are now somewhat removed from in our assessments. We now know that Covid-19 faded slowly in 2023; the public health experts in the center of the crisis did not. They followed what little science was available and made their best judgments. So let’s perhaps follow the decent path and evaluate but not castigate as we together try to understand just what happened.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02823-4', 'Headline': 'What scientists have learnt from COVID lockdowns - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Most scientists agree that lockdowns did curb COVID-19 deaths and that governments had little option but to restrict people’s social contacts in early 2020, to stem SARS-CoV-2’s spread and ...', 'Full_text': 'In March 2021, a doctor in Brazil named Ricardo Savaris published a now-discredited research paper that went viral on social media1.\n\nIt had been a year since the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic forced governments to apply the desperate measures collectively known as lockdowns — cancelling sporting and cultural events, closing retail outlets, restaurants, schools and universities, and ordering people to stay at home. At the time, countries were once again dialling lockdown policies up or down, as the Alpha variant of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 surged in different places.\n\nLockdown measures did what they were supposed to. When they were enforced rigorously enough to reduce people’s social contacts sharply, they shrank COVID-19 outbreaks; several studies had demonstrated this.\n\nBut Savaris, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, tried a fresh analysis together with three colleagues (who worked in statistics, computer science and informatics). They compared 87 locations around the world, in pairs, to see whether a lower rate of COVID-19 deaths correlated with greater time spent at home, assessed using anonymized cellphone data released by Google. In most cases, their paper in Scientific Reports concluded, it didn’t.\n\nThe paper was highlighted by prominent lockdown sceptics and some news sites and swiftly gained notoriety. “The findings were quite remarkable, on the face of it,” says Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist at the University of Wollongong, Australia. As he and others would show, the results were wrong, because of errors in the paper’s choice of statistical methods.\n\nWithin a week, Scientific Reports added an ‘editor’s note’ to the paper, alerting readers to criticisms. Nine months later, the journal published two letters2,3 that laid out the paper’s errors. A week after that, it retracted the work, although neither Savaris nor his co-authors agreed with the retraction. (Scientific Reports is published by Springer Nature; Nature’s reporting is editorially independent of its publisher.)\n\nThe retracted paper is not the only one to contend that lockdowns failed to save lives. But these analyses are out of step with the majority of studies. Most scientists agree that lockdowns did curb COVID-19 deaths and that governments had little option but to restrict people’s social contacts in early 2020, to stem SARS-CoV-2’s spread and avert the collapse of health-care systems. “We needed to buy ourselves some time,” says Lauren Meyers, a biological data scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThe pandemic’s true health cost: how much of our lives has COVID stolen?\n\nAt the same time, it’s clear that lockdowns had huge costs, and there is debate about the utility of any subsequent lockdown measures. School and university closures disrupted education. Closing businesses contributed to financial and social hardship, mental ill health and economic downturns. “There’s costs and benefits,” says Samir Bhatt, a public-health statistician at Imperial College London and the University of Copenhagen.\n\nScientists have been studying the effects of lockdowns during the pandemic in the hope that their findings could inform the response to future crises. They have reached some conclusions: countries that acted quickly to bring in stringent measures did best at preserving both lives and their economies, for instance. But researchers have also encountered difficulties. Analysing competing harms and benefits often comes down not to scientific calculations, but to value judgements, such as how to weigh costs that fall on some sections of society more than others. That is what makes lockdowns so hard to study — and can lead to bitter disagreement.\n\nTricky calculation\n\nThere’s a fundamental difficulty with analysing the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns: it is hard to know what would have happened in their absence.\n\nLockdowns do reduce viral transmission, as the shutdown of Wuhan, China, showed when SARS-CoV-2 first emerged. Even in countries that didn’t emulate China’s all-in approach of closing borders, ordering citizens to stay at home and isolating people with COVID in central facilities, lockdown measures still cut disease spread. In May 2020, for instance, Bhatt and others analysed lockdowns in 11 European countries and extrapolated from the fall in viral transmission that these measures alone had saved more than 3 million lives4.\n\nThat paper’s methodology has also been questioned, however. One issue is that it could have overstated the size of the benefit because it assumes that without lockdown mandates, people wouldn’t have reduced their social contacts. In reality, rising deaths would probably have changed people’s behaviour.\n\nThat happened in Florida, for instance, where data show a reduction in mobility during the first wave about two weeks before lockdowns, says health-policy researcher Thomas Tsai at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. “People were watching the news in New York and Boston and seeing how severe COVID could be,” he says.\n\nOne analysis5 by political scientist Christopher Berry and his colleagues at the University of Chicago, Illinois, supports this. It suggests that US states’ shelter-in-place orders did little to further reduce COVID-19 cases and deaths, not because social distancing doesn’t work, but because people were already avoiding contact before the orders were imposed.\n\nOther researchers have tried instead to compare whether countries with stricter lockdown policies performed better than those with more relaxed ones on measures such as disease transmission rates or deaths. This isn’t simple, either: enforcement, levels of government aid and compliance with official policies differed from one region to another — as did cultural context and a host of other factors, including population densities, levels of social contact and viral prevalence.\n\nTake Sweden, for instance, which imposed relatively light restrictions in early 2020, keeping schools open for all but the oldest students. It experienced a lower rate of excess deaths in 2020 than did many other western European nations. But it is also a country where many people live alone (the average household size in Sweden is the lowest in the European Union), and where people have high trust in government, making it much easier for official recommendations alone — rather than mandates — to reduce social contacts and slow disease spread. Far from carrying on life as normal, Swedes reduced their mobility, as shown by mobile-phone data. Even so, its Nordic neighbours that imposed lockdowns performed better in 2020: age-standardized mortality rates show that Denmark, Finland and Norway experienced fewer deaths than normal that year, whereas Sweden experienced slightly more than usual. (As in other countries, Sweden also failed to prevent the most vulnerable people, such as those in elder-care homes, from dying of COVID-19.)\n\n“It wasn’t really clear what is the best way of estimating the effectiveness of [lockdown] measures,” says Peter Klimek, a data scientist at the Medical University of Vienna. Still, by tracking the stringency and timing of government policies in more than 100 countries, researchers at the University of Oxford, UK, and their colleagues did find6 that the more stringent a nation’s containment policies, the more successful it was at averting deaths from COVID-19.\n\nIt is even harder to tease out subtler insights, such as which of the grab bag of lockdown policies — from closing schools to ordering people to stay at home — had the most effect, especially because policies were often announced in quick succession.\n\nAfter the first wave of COVID-19, Klimek’s team analysed thousands of government interventions. The group noted that some measures seemed effective according to one modelling approach, but not according to others, and that their effectiveness estimates came with wide uncertainty ranges. But the researchers were able to produce an overall ranking (see ‘How effective were COVID-19 interventions?’). The most effective measures were policies banning small gatherings and closing businesses and schools, closely followed by land-border restrictions and national lockdowns. Less-intrusive measures — such as government support for vulnerable populations, and risk-communication strategies — also had an impact. Airport health checks, however, had no discernible benefit7.\n\nOther studies have tried to put more precise figures on the effects of lockdown policies, but their findings differ. An analysis8 of 41 countries in Europe and elsewhere found that stay-at-home orders had a relatively small impact on transmission, reducing R — the average number of people that one person with COVID-19 will go on to infect — by just 13% beyond what could be achieved by closing schools and universities (38%) or limiting gatherings to 10 people or fewer (42%). Yet Bhatt’s analysis4 of 11 countries suggested that stay-at-home orders cut R by 81%, with school closures, public-event bans and other measures being less important. Klimek warns against generalizing about the effectiveness of lockdown policies on the basis of figures such as these. “The effectiveness of each intervention is highly context dependent,” he says. What several analyses suggest is that no single intervention can reduce R to below 1 (signifying that infections are declining): multiple measures achieve this by working in concert.\n\nGo hard, go fast\n\nThe pre-vaccine period of the pandemic does show that countries that acted harshly and swiftly — the ‘go hard, go fast’ approach — often fared better than those that waited to implement lockdown policies. China’s harsh lockdowns eliminated COVID-19 locally, for a time. Successful countries that learnt from this were “proactive”, according to a May 2021 report9 by the Independent Panel on Pandemic Preparedness & Response, established by the World Health Organization in September 2020 to review the global response. Examples include island nations such as Iceland, Australia and New Zealand, which also benefited from being able to close their borders and take action before many people with the virus arrived.\n\nOthers have echoed this. Epidemiologist Edward Knock and other members of the Imperial College COVID-19 response team concluded that nationwide lockdown was the only measure that consistently took R below 1 in England. And the earlier that strict measures were imposed, the better. Knock estimated that had England introduced a nationwide lockdown one week earlier in March 2020, it would have halved deaths during the first wave10. A study11 of government responses in Asia also suggested that a ‘go hard, go fast’ approach was best.\n\nBut harsher lockdowns aren’t always more effective by themselves, especially in countries where it is difficult for people to stay at home. Peru is an example. It imposed early and strict lockdown measures, but experienced an excess death rate much higher than did other countries in the region that used less draconian measures. Peru is still held up as evidence that lockdowns don’t work — but in fact it struggled to enforce them. The country has a large informal workforce, combined with expensive and inadequate health infrastructure. Despite lockdowns, many Peruvians continued to venture out to shop and to work, and so transmission remained stubbornly high, says Camila Gianella Malca, a public-policy researcher at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in Lima.\n\nSecond wave\n\nThe impacts of lockdowns also differed from one pandemic wave to the next. By the time second waves emerged, so much had been learnt about the virus that people’s behaviour was quite different. By October 2020, population-wide masking policies had become common. Schools and other settings established physical-distancing measures to keep people apart, and people took more precautions when local transmission increased. Hospitals also learnt quickly how best to treat COVID-19: death rates after the first wave decreased by 20% owing to improved treatment alone.\n\nTogether, these changes dampened the extent to which countries benefited from lockdowns. For example, several studies found that school closures during the first wave reduced the spread of COVID-19. Yet Bhatt’s analysis12 suggests that second-wave school closures had a much smaller effect. “We were surprised by that, to be honest,” he says.\n\nOnly a handful of countries continued to take a ’go hard, go fast’ approach after the first wave. Countries that had aimed for elimination — China, Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam, for example — saw that it worked and then went harder and faster, according to research by Anna Petherick, a public-policy researcher at the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government and her colleagues, who tracked government policies in more than 180 countries13. But in countries where belated first-wave lockdowns had merely lessened transmission, governments became less likely to take early action, tolerating higher case numbers in subsequent waves before ordering lockdowns (see ‘Thresholds for lockdown’).\n\nBlunt tool?\n\nSome researchers argue that countries could have avoided blunt all-of-society lockdowns, especially after the measures taken early in 2020. Among them is Mark Woolhouse, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, who advised the Scottish government during the pandemic. He argues that it might have been possible to avoid the closing of schools and cooping-up of younger people — who were at lower risk of COVID-19 — while focusing efforts on protecting vulnerable and older people as soon as high-risk individuals and settings were identified. “This pandemic was crying out for [a] precision public-health response, because the risks associated with the public-health threat with the virus were so focused on a small minority, and the harms done by things like lockdown were not focused on the same people,” he says.\n\nBut many researchers have pushed back against the idea that a more targeted approach was ever possible. Klimek says that roughly one-third of the population in wealthy nations was vulnerable because of underlying health conditions, so targeted measures would have been difficult to implement. And the virus has caused not only deaths but also post-infection illnesses such as long COVID — which has emerged as a health burden even for people who had mild disease.\n\nAnother targeted option for governments considering how to reopen societies might have been to keep only high-risk locations closed — restaurants and bars, say, or even neighbourhoods with high population mobility, says Serina Chang at Stanford University in California, who worked with colleagues to identify such places using cellphone data14. But shutting down neighbourhoods would probably disproportionately affect socially disadvantaged communities. “Fairness is such an important question here,” she says.\n\nBenefits versus harms\n\nWoolhouse says there was scant effort to debate the scale of potential harms caused by lockdowns, meaning that policymakers were unable to weigh up costs and benefits properly. Indeed, early on, many countries adopted a ‘save lives at any cost’ approach, he says.\n\nAnd lockdown policies did bring costs. Although they delayed outbreaks, saving lives by allowing countries to hang on for vaccines and drugs, they also brought significant social isolation and associated mental-health problems, rising rates of domestic violence and violence against women, cancelled medical appointments and disruption to education for children and university students. And they were often (although not always) accompanied by economic downturns.\n\nBut the common refrain that lockdowns involved a choice — saving lives versus livelihoods, or lives versus the economy — is a false dichotomy, says Stuart McDonald, an actuary and founder of the UK-based COVID-19 Actuaries Response Group, a community of specialists who have carried out regular analyses of mortality during the pandemic. If the UK government had not imposed belated lockdowns in 2020, hospital systems would have been overrun, death rates for all kinds of illnesses would have rocketed and economies and livelihoods would have collapsed anyway, he says. One analysis15 up to November 2021 estimated that the United States lost US$65.3 billion a month during lockdowns. But another16 estimated that US lockdowns from early March until the end of July 2020 added between $632.5 billion and $765 billion to the economy, compared with the alternative of no lockdowns. Unsurprisingly, the countries that did best in terms of saving lives and protecting the economy were those that acted fast with strict lockdowns.\n\nThe pandemic derailed learning for 1.6 billion students. Here’s how to help them catch up\n\nWhat is more, some governments did at least try to consider various harms, McDonald says. In July 2020, for instance, McDonald attended a meeting of the UK government’s COVID-19 advisory group to discuss efforts to model the direct and indirect health impacts of lockdowns, measured by the preservation or loss of quality-adjusted life years — QALYs. (This measure gives more weight to younger lives than the lives of older people, who are judged to have lost fewer QALYs if they die.) Fewer deaths from road accidents were tallied as a benefit of lockdown, for instance; QALYs lost owing to delayed cancer diagnoses, or poorer health owing to loss of income, were harms. In August 2020, the report discussed at the meeting was publicly released17: it argued that QALYs lost would have been three times higher had there been no mitigation measures, such as lockdowns, in place. (McDonald was not involved in writing it, but contributed to subsequent versions of the report.)\n\nNot all harms can be accounted for in this way. Loss of education because of school closures might indirectly harm children in the long run, potentially decreasing their future earnings and placing them at greater risk of poorer health outcomes. McDonald says that such harms are so far off — decades, in some cases — that they can’t readily be factored into a QALY ledger.\n\nValue judgements\n\nPure economic analyses of whether lockdowns were worth it generally try to estimate the value of lives saved and compare that with the costs of economic downturns. But there is no consensus on how to make this comparison. Tweaks to the value placed on human life in these analyses can alter conclusions about whether lockdowns were worth it, found Lisa Robinson, a public-policy analyst at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and her colleagues18. If older lives are assigned a lower monetary value than younger ones, for instance, then — because COVID-19 disproportionately affected older people — lockdowns might be judged to have provided less benefit than if all lives are valued equally.\n\nJonathan Aldred, an economist at the University of Cambridge, UK, says that cost–benefit calculations of this kind are ill-suited to decision-making during an emergency, given the numerous sources of uncertainty. Putting monetary values on everything — from lives lost to the economic hit caused by shop closures — can give the impression that decisions about lockdowns are objective. But, says Aldred, the upshot is that “you’re hiding the fact that there are ethical judgements that have been made”. Policymakers should instead have a transparent discussion about the ethics of weighing costs and benefits, says Aldred, rather than suggest there is a ‘scientific’ answer. Without this kind of reckoning, we could be “back to square one” in a future pandemic, he says, with the same contentious debates about whether to close schools and at what harm to other sections of society.\n\nThe next pandemic\n\nNow that COVID-19 vaccines and treatments for severe disease are widely available, most countries that have taken full advantage of them are unlikely to return to lockdowns. So what have researchers learnt that can inform decisions when another viral pandemic arrives?\n\nOne lesson that Klimek takes from lockdown studies is that there was an early window of opportunity when the virus could have been eliminated — as it was, in effect, in countries such as China, Australia and New Zealand. Had harsher measures been adopted sooner, and more widely, the pandemic might have played out very differently. “I think this is the big learning that we need to take away,” he says.\n\nThe paradox is that a successful early clampdown, or hard and fast action against a virus that turns out to be milder than initial indications suggest, could lead to complaints of overreaction.\n\nA future threat might, of course, also spread in a completely different way from COVID-19. Ethical choices could look very different if the next pandemic is caused by an influenza virus that predominantly affects and is spread by young children.\n\nLockdowns hold another clear lesson: they exacerbate inequalities that already exist in society. Those already living in poverty and insecurity are hit hardest. Guarding against these unequal impacts requires improved health access and financial safeguards when times are good.\n\nAnd transparency is key, too: the public needs to know more about how pandemic-control policies are decided, says Tsai. “That makes public-health policymaking seem less capricious,” he says, “because it’s reactive to both the science and values.”'}}",98.21428571428571,1

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-did-it-robby-mook-michael-sussmann-donald-trump-russia-collusion-alfa-bank-11653084709', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton Did It - WSJ - The Wall Street Journal', 'Snippet': 'The Russia-Trump collusion narrative of 2016 and beyond was a dirty trick for the ages, and now we know it came from the top—candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.', 'Full_text': ''}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60868795', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton over Russian collusion allegations - BBC', 'Snippet': ""Donald Trump's campaign was accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the 2016 election. ...

when then-Attorney-General William Barr appointed Mr Durham, a veteran prosecutor, to probe potential missteps by the FBI when it launched its early stage Crossfire Hurricane inquiry into potential contacts between Mr Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nMr Durham said there were a series of missteps by the FBI and Justice Department as investigators undertook a politically explosive probe in the heat of the 2016 election into whether the Trump campaign was colluding with Russia to tip the outcome.\n\nBut the report fell far short of the former president\'s prediction he would uncover the ""crime of the century"".\n\nThat Crossfire Hurricane investigation would later be handed over to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who in March 2019 concluded there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump\'s 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nIn his new 306-page report, Mr Durham concluded that US intelligence and law enforcement did not possess any ""actual evidence"" of collusion between Mr Trump\'s campaign and Russia prior to launching Crossfire Hurricane.\n\nHe also accused the bureau of treating the 2016 Trump probe differently from other politically sensitive investigations, including several involving Mr Trump\'s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nFor instance, he said Ms Clinton and other officials received defensive briefings about being the possible targets of foreign interference, whereas Mr Trump received no such briefing before the FBI opened probes into four members of his campaign.\n\n""Senior FBI personnel displayed a serious lack of analytical rigour towards the information that they received, especially information from politically affiliated persons and entities.""\n\nIn response to the report, the FBI said it has already implemented dozens of corrective actions that have been in place for some time.\n\nThe report criticised the FBI for opening a full-fledged investigation based on ""raw, unanalysed and uncorroborated intelligence,"" saying the speed at which it did so was a departure from the norm.\n\nIt said investigators repeatedly relied on ""confirmation bias"", ignoring or rationalising away evidence that undercut their premise of a Trump-Russia conspiracy as they pushed the probe forward.\n\nPolitical implications of report\n\nMr Durham\'s report was released to Congress on Monday without redactions, after it was delivered to Attorney-General Merrick Garland on Friday.\n\nMr Durham and his team cast a broad net, interviewing top officials at the FBI, Justice Department and CIA.\n\nIn his first year on the job, he travelled with Mr Barr to Italy to meet with government officials as Mr Trump himself asked then-Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and other leaders to help with the probe.\n\nHis findings are likely to become political fodder for Mr Trump, who is planning to run for re-election in 2024 despite facing criminal charges in New York and two federal investigations by Special Counsel Jack Smith that are looking both at Mr Trump\'s retention of classified records and his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMr Trump had hoped Mr Durham would release his report ahead of the 2020 election, in what he thought would be a blow to President Joe Biden\'s campaign.\n\nBut Mr Durham\'s investigation has largely failed to produce a meaningful impact, after two separate juries acquitted both defendants he tried to prosecute in 2022.\n\nIn one case Mr Durham brought, a Washington DC jury acquitted Hillary Clinton\'s former campaign attorney Michael Sussmann on charges he lied to the FBI when he met with the bureau in September 2016 to share a tip about possible communications between Mr Trump\'s business and a Russian bank.\n\nMr Durham\'s investigation was dealt yet another major set-back just a few months later, when a jury in Virginia acquitted Russian researcher Igor Danchenko of charges that he lied to the FBI

Christopher Steele, made allegations about ties between Mr Trump\'s 2016 election campaign and Russia and contained salacious details — many of which were never substantiated.\n\nAn investigation by

inspector general previously raised about the rigour of the FBI\'s process for applying to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for wiretap applications.\n\nThe FBI has since implemented

Donald J. Trump is a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States and current president-elect. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels as hush money to buy her silence over a sexual encounter between them; with costs related to the transaction included, the payments totaled $420,000. The Manhattan District Attorney (DA), Alvin Bragg, accused Trump of falsifying these business records with the intent to commit other crimes: violation of federal campaign finance limits, unlawfully influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and tax fraud.[a]\n\nThe indictment, the first of a former U.S. president, was approved by a Manhattan grand jury on March 30, 2023. On April 3, Trump traveled from his residence in Florida to New York City, where he surrendered to the Manhattan DA\'s office and was arraigned the next day. Trump pleaded not guilty and stated that he would continue to campaign for the 2024 presidential election, even if convicted. The trial began on April 15, 2024. On April 30, Trump also became the first U.S. president to be held in criminal contempt of court, due to comments he made earlier in the month about individuals involved with the trial.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Trump\'s 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the payment of hush money to Daniels through Trump\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who was reimbursed via a false retainer agreement. The prosecution rested on May 20, 2024, after calling 20 witnesses. The defense argued that Trump was unaware of any allegedly unlawful scheme, that Cohen was unreliable as a witness, and that the retainer agreement between them was valid. The defense rested on May 21 after calling two witnesses. Throughout proceedings, the defense also made unsuccessful requests for the case to be delayed or dismissed, for the judge to recuse himself, and for a mistrial.\n\nTrump was convicted on all counts on May 30, 2024, becoming the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. On November 19, the Manhattan DA agreed to postpone sentencing until after Trump\'s second presidency; Trump has said that he will appeal the ruling, which cannot take place until after sentencing.\n\nBackground\n\nStormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn July 2006, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known professionally as ""Stormy Daniels"", met Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. At the time, Trump was the host of the reality TV series The Apprentice and was married to Melania Trump.[4] According to Daniels, Trump invited her to his penthouse at Harrah\'s Lake Tahoe[5] where the two had sex and talked about making her a guest on The Apprentice.[6][7]\n\nIn 2011, Daniels considered selling the story to the celebrity magazine Life & Style for US$15,000 as Trump began exploring a potential presidential bid. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened to sue Life & Style when it asked the Trump Organization for comment. Daniels\' agent, Gina Rodriguez, leaked the story to the gossip blog The Dirty in October. The post was taken down following complaints by Trump\'s lawyers, and Daniels disputed the story\'s veracity.[8] Cohen acknowledged during court testimony in May 2024 that he advised for the story\'s removal.[9]\n\nAs Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign began, Rodriguez approached multiple publications—including the National Enquirer—and attempted to sell the story. Following the publication of a controversial recording of Trump and Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, the National Enquirer sought to suppress the story. Rather than paying Daniels, the National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard negotiated a $130,000 non-disclosure agreement between Daniels and Michael Cohen. Cohen attempted to find the money as the election neared and repeatedly delayed her payment. Keith Davidson, Daniels\' lawyer, canceled the deal in October 2016.[5][8]\n\nUltimately, Cohen drew the money from his home equity line of credit and sent it through a shell company incorporated in Delaware.[5][8] Trump initially denied knowing about the check made out to Daniels. In April 2018, aboard Air Force One, he told a reporter he did not know where Cohen got the money.[10] Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post described this statement as a lie,[11] as Trump had personally reimbursed Cohen for the payment.[12][11][13] Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, also refuted Trump\'s claims in a Fox News interview, saying that Trump was aware of the payments.[14]\n\nTrump wrote several checks totaling $420,000 to Cohen. The checks reimbursed him for the non-disclosure agreement and covered the costs for Cohen to manipulate online polls to boost Trump\'s status. The $180,000 paid to Cohen was doubled to offset taxes, and $60,000 was added. These payments were made throughout 2017, during Trump\'s first year of presidency.[15] The payments made to Cohen were declared as a legal expense.[16] Nine monthly checks from Trump to Cohen, dated April to December 2017, exist as evidence.[17]\n\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported on Cohen\'s payment to Daniels.[18] Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts relating to the payment—as well as another payment made to Karen McDougal—in August. In his admission of guilt, Cohen stated that he acted ""at the direction of a candidate for federal office"", implicating Trump.[19][20] In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison.[21]\n\nOn May 2, 2024, The Daily Beast broke a story that Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg had assisted the 2016 campaign with its finance reports.[22]\n\nManhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nFollowing Cohen\'s August 2018 admission of guilt, Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance Jr. opened an investigation against the Trump Organization and two of its executives.[23] The office paused its inquiry when the office of the federal U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York began a separate investigation into the payments,[24] but the federal inquiry concluded without charges in July 2019.[25][b]\n\nThe Manhattan DA\'s office then issued a subpoena for the Trump Organization in August, seeking documents relating to the payments.[27] Additionally, the office subpoenaed accounting firm Mazars USA, demanding eight years of Trump\'s corporate tax returns.[28] Trump\'s lawyers sued Vance to block the subpoena, citing Trump\'s immunity from criminal inquiries as the president of the United States.[29] In Trump v. Vance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7–2 in favor of Vance, allowing the subpoena to continue.[30]\n\nFollowing the 2021 New York County District Attorney election, Alvin Bragg succeeded Vance as the Manhattan DA.[31] In early 2021, Mark Pomerantz, a Manhattan prosecutor, sought to revive the case under the theory that if Daniels had extorted Trump, the money would be criminal proceeds, and efforts to conceal its source would constitute money laundering.[32] On further examination, Pomerantz found that the money laundering statute would not apply, and colleagues were skeptical that the hush money would qualify as extortion.[32] With no path to felony charges, Pomerantz abandoned the inquiry and subsequently resigned in February 2022.[32] In January 2023, the Manhattan DA\'s office impaneled a grand jury, and began presenting evidence of Trump\'s role in the Stormy Daniels payment.[33] Cohen met extensively with the DA\'s office and the grand jury,[34][35][36] and by March 3, Cohen had met with the DA\'s office 18 times[37][38][39] and had given his cellphones to the DA\'s prosecutors, who wanted evidence of communications including voice recordings of Daniels\' former lawyer Keith Davidson.[40] Several other witnesses met with the DA\'s office or the grand jury in March 2023, including Kellyanne Conway,[41] Hope Hicks, two Trump Organization employees, two former National Enquirer executives who helped broker the hush-money deal, a lawyer for Daniels,[42][43] Daniels herself,[44] Trump-aligned lawyer Robert Costello (who provided testimony, including emails, in which he attempted to discredit Cohen\'s reliability),[45][46] and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.[47][48][c] As early as that February, prosecutors confirmed that they might leverage additional charges, including insurance fraud, against Allen Weisselberg to pressure him to testify against Trump,[51] and in May, The New York Times reported that they were considering perjury charges against him.[52]\n\nIn March 2023, District Attorney Alvin Bragg\'s office indicated that an indictment was likely.[53] By March 9, 2023, prosecutors had offered Trump a chance to testify before the grand jury the following week, indicating that they were likely preparing to indict him.[54][55] Around that time, Trump and his spokesperson began referring to both Daniels\' allegation and the DA\'s proceedings as ""extortion"".[56] On March 10, 2023, Trump\'s lawyer Joe Tacopina asked New York City\'s Department of Investigation to review the criminal probe, asserting its ""weaponization"".[57] On March 13, Tacopina announced that Trump would not testify.[58] Early the next morning, The Guardian reported that Trump\'s lawyers had argued to the DA that Trump should not be indicted on the basis that the payment did not draw from campaign funds and would have been made regardless of his candidacy.[59]\n\nIn late March 2023, there was reporting around Daniels having reportedly unsuccessfully communicated in 2018 with Tacopina about possibly representing her in the scandal, for which the DA could move to disqualify the lawyer due to attorney–client privilege and because she reputedly disclosed confidential information to his firm.[60][61][62][63] Additionally, it reemerged that, in 2018, Tacopina had called the hush-money payment ""an illegal agreement"", ""a fraud"", and ""a potential campaign finance issue"".[60]\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Trump claimed on his social-media platform, Truth Social, that he was to be arrested on March 21[d][e] and that the proceedings were disinformation backed by President Joe Biden, calling for protests in anticipation of a possible indictment.[66][67][68][69][70] Law enforcement and security agencies prepared for potential reactions to an indictment of Trump that week, especially in the areas of the Manhattan Criminal Court and Trump Tower, including by monitoring online threats.[69][71][72][f] New York City Police began to increase security in preparation for the expected indictment on March 21, and a second time for the second expected indictment on March 30.[74] Metal barriers were set up around Trump Tower and the district Criminal Court Building.[75] On March 24, Trump, citing his presidential prospects, insinuated that ""potential death & destruction"" could result from Bragg\'s allegedly false charge.[76][g]\n\nTrump has called the investigation a ""witch hunt"", claiming political persecution.[81] Trump proponents have referred to the case as harassment, calling it a ""political hack job"".[82] The trial and accompanying political theatrics have been described as a ""circus"" by the media.[83][84][85] Due to multiple investigation revivals, the case earned the moniker of ""zombie case"".[32][86]\n\nEligibility for president\n\nThe Article II of the U.S. Constitution does not have any rules blocking presidential candidates with criminal records.[87] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier in Trump v. Anderson that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking the prohibition in section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which states ""no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US"".[88]\n\nInitial proceedings\n\nIndictment and charges\n\nThe Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on March 30, 2023.[89] The indictment was filed with the New York Supreme Court (the ordinary trial court for felonies in the state of New York and not the final court of appeal for the state) the same day.[90] The charges were under seal until published when Trump was arraigned.[91][92]\n\nThe indictment charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law §175.10.[93][94] Each count is related to a specific business document, each having a date ranging from February 14 through December 5, 2017:[95]\n\n11 for invoices from Michael Cohen\n\n9 for general ledger entries for Donald J. Trump\n\n9 for checks from Donald J. Trump\n\n3 for general ledger entries for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\n2 for checks from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\nThe allegedly falsified documents are related to Trump\'s payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money. The payments were listed in the business records as a legal expense payable to Michael Cohen, whereas the indictment alleges that they were actually to reimburse Cohen for the earlier, allegedly illicit, payment to Daniels.[96][97]\n\nFalsifying business records in the first degree is a felony under New York state law that requires that the ""intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof"". This is in contrast to falsifying business records in the second degree, which is a misdemeanor that does not have that requirement.[95][96][97] The charges neither include, nor even identify, the additional crimes, constituting a relatively unusual strategy for the DA:[98][95]\n\nA New York Times analysis of about 30 false business records cases brought by Mr. Bragg and his predecessor — based on court records, interviews and information the office provided — shows that in this respect, the case against Mr. Trump stands apart. In all but two of the indictments reviewed by The Times, the defendant was charged with an additional crime on top of the false records charge.\n\nIn later filings, Bragg listed (but still did not charge) three general types of crime that Trump allegedly intended to commit: violation of federal campaign finance limits, violation of state election laws by unlawfully influencing the 2016 election, and violation of state tax laws regarding the reimbursement.[99] Trump could have moved to allow the jury to convict on the misdemeanor charges as a lesser included offense, but he did not.[100][101]\n\nEach count for which Trump was convicted could result in a prison sentence of up to four years, to be served consecutively, with a maximum sentence of 20 years.[102][95][103][104] He is permitted to assume the presidency even should he be in prison.[105] The judge may also choose to impose no prison sentence.[106]\n\nThe conviction did not legally prohibit Trump from continuing his campaign in the 2024 presidential election, which he won.[105] (Trump had stated in an April 2023 Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson that he would continue his candidacy even if convicted.)[107][108]\n\nArraignment\n\nTrump was arraigned on April 4, 2023. A law enforcement source told Reuters that police would close streets around the courthouse in advance of Trump\'s expected appearance.[109] On April 3, Trump flew from Palm Beach International Airport into LaGuardia Airport on his private plane, and took his motorcade to Trump Tower, where he stayed the night.[110][111] Todd Blanche, a lawyer who had defended Paul Manafort during his 2016 fraud trial, had recently resigned from his law firm to aid Trump\'s case.[112] Police increased security in and around Manhattan ahead of the arraignment; authorities said there were no credible threats of violence or organized plans of protests.[111] Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, warned protestors to be peaceful.[113] Acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is presiding over the case.[114] Merchan denied a motion filed by media organizations to allow a television broadcast of the arraignment or to allow electronic devices to be used in the courtroom, but allowed five press pool still photographers.[115][116] Courtroom sketch artists also documented the proceedings.[117] The courtroom\'s glass doors were covered as a security measure.[118]\n\nUpon entering the courthouse, he was put in police custody and placed under arrest.[119][120] He was booked and fingerprinted, but he was not handcuffed, nor was a mug shot taken.[121][122] Trump entered the courtroom an hour later,[123] pleading not guilty to 34 felony charges.[124] The indictment was unsealed (publicly released) shortly thereafter, charging Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree as part of a ""conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election"".[125][126] This marked the first indictment of a former U.S. president.[127][128][129] At the arraignment, Merchan warned Trump not to use social media to incite violence.[130]\n\nPossible trial dates were discussed; prosecutors proposed January 2024, but Trump\'s defense team objected, saying that the trial should be set for later in 2024.[131]\n\nImmediately after the arraignment, Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago and addressed a crowd of supporters in the evening.[132][110] Trump made several false claims about topics such as his handling of government documents, District Attorney Bragg, and the Trump–Raffensperger phone call.[133]\n\nPre-trial proceedings\n\nDuring Trump\'s arraignment, the court set deadlines for pre-trial proceedings, including for prosecutors to provide discovery to the defense.[131] The court set a deadline of August 8, 2023, for pre-trial motions to be filed.[131]\n\nAs he had done in other cases, Trump used ""attack-and-delay"" tactics, targeting the prosecutors and the judge while prolonging proceedings, with the aim that the case might continue into late 2024, near the presidential election.[134][135]\n\nTrump\'s lawyers maintained that he was unaware of any allegedly unlawful schemes that his allies or associates may have engaged in.[136] On March 12, 2024, the defense team filed their strategy writing ""President Trump lacked the requisite intent to commit the conduct charged in the Indictment because of his awareness that various lawyers were involved in the underlying conduct giving rise to the charges.""[137] The defense counsel stated that they would not invoke the formal ""advice of counsel"" defense, but that Trump would ""elicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges"".[137][138][h]\n\nRequest for indictment dismissal\n\nOn September 29, 2023, Trump\'s team submitted omnibus motions to dismiss the indictment and requesting clarification of the charges.[140]\n\nOn April 27, Trump\'s team had asked for the charges to be explained in full.[141] It was possible that the second crime(s) would eventually be specified in a bill of particulars,[142] but according to a governing appeals case from c. 1980 this is not necessary.[143] On May 16, the DA\'s office argued that it did not need to elaborate further on the basis that Trump already ""has more than sufficient information to prepare his defense"", while reiterating possible secondary charges.[144][145][i] Trump\'s team was reportedly considering invoking a 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision which emphasizes the importance of specifying punishable criminal charges; additionally, a 1999 decision states that ""any fact ... that increases the maximum penalty for [one] crime must be charged in an indictment ... and proved"".[141]\n\nOn February 15, 2024, the court denied the motions to dismiss.[146][147][148] However, the court did partially grant Trump\'s request seeking clarification of the charges. Trump is not only accused of falsifying business records, but doing so with the intention to commit or conceal some other crime. Holding it would be unfair to expect Trump to prepare a defense to a newly raised theory mid-trial, the court limited the prosecution to just three theories of ""other crimes"" that had already been identified during pre-trial procedure.[146][149]\n\nDiscovery materials and witnesses\n\nAs of Trump\'s arraignment on April 4, 2023, it was expected that the discovery process would take several months.[150]\n\nOn April 17, 2023, the DA\'s office requested that Merchan obtain further information from Tacopina, including his firm\'s correspondence with Daniels, to determine whether their history constituted a conflict of interest.[63] On September 1, Merchan ruled that it did not.[151]\n\nOn May 4, Merchan heard arguments about the DA office\'s request to restrict information it turns over to Trump\'s lawyers from being shared with Trump himself (at least until the trial), citing his past social-media posts attacking Bragg and witnesses. The defense has argued that the government should be equally restrained from discussing information publicly and that Trump should be allowed to defend himself politically.[152][153] On May 8, Merchan ruled in favor of the order, barring evidence from being shared on social media.[154] The judge instructed Trump and his lawyers on their conduct on May 23, informing them that violations could incur a ""wide range of sanctions"" including being held in contempt of court.[155]\n\nOn May 26, prosecutors stated that they had informed Trump\'s lawyers that evidence in the hush-money case includes various audio recordings, including one of Trump and a witness. It was unclear if this was in reference to secretly recorded audio from September 2016 which Cohen had previously released.[156][157][158][159]\n\nOn August 3, federal judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversaw E. Jean Carroll\'s civil lawsuits against Trump alleging sexual assault and defamation,[j] ruled that Carroll\'s lawyers could provide video of Trump being deposed to Manhattan prosecutors.[162]\n\nOn January 15, 2024, Tacopina withdrew from Trump\'s counsel[163] and Daniels said she expected to testify.[164] Later in the month, the DA was reportedly beginning to meet with witnesses ahead of the trial.[165]\n\nOn March 18, the judge ruled that both Daniels and Cohen could testify, placing some restrictions on Daniels (as well as Karen McDougal). The defense had requested that the two be blocked from testifying the previous month. Additionally, the judge ruled that Trump\'s Access Hollywood tape could not be played during the trial but that it could be discussed.[166]\n\nOn April 22, Merchan ruled on what prosecutors may ask Trump if he testified,[167] following a pretrial Sandoval hearing held on April 19.[168][169][170]\n\nOn May 10, Judge Juan Merchan suggested that Allen Weisselberg could be called to testify in court after the defense objected to the prosecution\'s plan to show the jury a $750,000 severance agreement.[171] Neither the defense nor the prosecution had subpoenaed Weisselberg, and there were procedural concerns about adding him to the witness list so late in the trial.[171] Furthermore, Weisselberg\'s testimony could be in violation of the non-disparagement clause of his severance agreement and he would likely invoke the fifth amendment.[172][173]\n\nRequests for recusal\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, who has experience with financial cases,[174] was randomly assigned to oversee the grand jury proceedings in Trump\'s case, and continued to oversee handling of the charges approved by the grand jury.[175]\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers filed a motion asking Judge Merchan to recuse himself from the case citing his daughter\'s position as partner and COO of Authentic Campaigns, a consulting firm that serviced Biden\'s 2020 presidential campaign. The motion additionally alleged that Merchan had encouraged former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg to cooperate with the prosecution against Trump in a previous case he had presided over, and that Merchan had made three $10–15 donations to various Democratic causes.[176][177][k] On June 20, the DA\'s office argued against the recusal request, citing Trump\'s alleged ""prolific history of baselessly accusing state and federal judges around the country of bias"", saying he seemed to be trying to land a more favorable judge. Prosecutors further argued that there was a lack of hard evidence that a particular trial result would aid Merchan directly or greatly via his daughter\'s Democratic work,[180] which a state ethics panel had similarly concluded in early May.[181][l] The court denied the motion on August 11, 2023.[185]\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the defense asked Merchan for permission to file a motion repeating their prior request that he recuse himself for what the defense said was a conflict of interest due to his daughter\'s Democratic involvement.[186] On April 1, the New York City Bar Association issued a statement of ""unequivocal support"" for Merchan\'s handling of the recusal concerns.[m] On April 2, prosecutors pointed out that the court and an ethics panel had already found that the political activities of a relative are not grounds for questioning a judge\'s impartiality.[188][n]\n\nThe same day, Trump posted a Fox & Friends clip in which co-host Brian Kilmeade criticized the judge\'s daughter, although Trump highlighted another commentator\'s statement.[191] As of April 3, Trump had not deleted offending posts made prior to Merchan\'s expanded order;[192] that night, he linked to a report by far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Merchan\'s daughter and wife.[193] On April 5, Trump\'s campaign publicized their motion for Merchan to recuse himself (dated April 3),[188] which asserts numerous counts of bias, and falsely cites the state Office of Court Administration (OCA) as saying Merchan\'s daughter deleted her X account in April 2023, around when the judge ""solicited an ethics opinion regarding recusal in a letter ... that the Court declined to disclose"".[194][181][195][o][p]\n\nOn April 6, Trump posted online that if arrested for violating the gag order, he would consider it a ""great honor"" to ""become a Modern Day Nelson Mandela"", the former South African president jailed for anti-apartheid activism.[201] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked an appeals court to delay the trial and pause the gag order while they appeal the latter; this was denied the following day.[202][203] On April 10, an appeals judge denied another defense delay request which was based on Merchan having not yet ruled on the recusal motion.[204][202] On April 15, Merchan denied the recusal motion.[205] On April 30, an appellate court denied requests for both a recusal and a stay of proceedings.[206]\n\nRequest for removal to federal court\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers asked for the case to be moved to a federal court (though it would remain a state-law prosecution conducted by the Manhattan DA), arguing that it involved alleged conduct somehow ""performed while in office""—despite the potential federal election-law violations not being specified and occurring prior to Trump\'s inauguration.[153][145][q] As proceedings continued in the New York Supreme Court,[207] Bragg asked for the removal request to be dismissed, arguing that Trump had failed to establish that he was an officer of the United States during his presidency,[208][209] to which the defense expounded its initial argument.[210][153] Even if the case had been moved to federal court, New York state law would have continued to apply.[211]\n\nIn a hearing on June 27, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein opined that Trump\'s conduct likely did not constitute presidential activity.[212] On July 19, arguing that the matter was apparently a personal ""cover-up of an embarrassing event"", Hellerstein ruled that the case should remain in state court.[213] Trump appealed the decision on July 28,[214] but withdrew this on November 14.[215]\n\nTrial scheduling\n\nOn May 23, 2023, Justice Merchan set the trial for March 25, 2024.[216] Trump\'s team complained that he expected to have multiple trials around that time. Merchan said he would discuss rescheduling to another time.[217] At a February 15, 2024, hearing, which Trump attended,[218] Merchan reaffirmed the March 25 trial date.[219]\n\nIn early February 2024, Trump\'s federal election obstruction trial, originally set for early March, was postponed pending appeals, increasing the likelihood of the Manhattan criminal trial taking place as planned on March 25, 2024.[220][221]\n\nOn March 11, 2024, Trump\'s lawyers requested a delay of trial until after the federal election obstruction case on the basis that it would bolster his argument of presidential immunity, as some evidence and allegedly some acts overlapped with his time in office.[222] Trump\'s team cited, from April 2018, Trump\'s denying knowledge of the hush-money payment to reporters and tweeting in defense of Cohen\'s credibility.[223] Later on March 11, Merchan pointed out that Trump\'s team had missed the filing deadline and said either party would need his permission to file additional pretrial motions.[222] On March 3, the judge dismissed the request as untimely.[224]\n\nAlso on March 11, Trump asked to delay trial until after the Supreme Court decides whether he is generally immune from prosecution in the federal charges on election obstruction. Granting the motion would have delayed trial until mid-summer or later, as the Supreme Court had already scheduled those arguments for April 25[225] and may not rule until the end of the court\'s term in early July.[226] Merchan denied the motion on April 3,[227] saying that he doubted its ""sincerity and actual purpose"", given that Trump made this request only two weeks before trial.[228]\n\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office provided prosecutors with approximately 170,000 pages of documents, largely related to the 2017 federal probe of Cohen\'s payment to Daniels (and mostly reflecting evidence already turned over to Trump\'s lawyers in June 2023).[229][230][231] Trump\'s lawyers sought a delay in the trial on the basis of the newly produced records; the DA\'s office said in court that only 300 of the documents were relevant to Trump\'s defense.[232] On March 15, 2024, the judge delayed the start of trial until mid-April.[233] On March 25, 2024, the judge set a trial date of April 15, and denied a motion by Trump\'s team to further delay the trial.[232] On May 23, 2024, Merchan denied Trump\'s request to sanction prosecutors regarding the document release, ruling that the defense was provided sufficient time to respond.[234]\n\nOn March 18, Trump\'s team requested an additional delay on the basis that pretrial publicity and apparent anti-Trump bias in Manhattan would prohibit a fair jury from being selected in April, although only 35% in the cited poll said they were convinced Trump was guilty in the DA\'s case specifically. Trump\'s lawyers cited berating statements by Cohen, e.g. saying he served jail time because his ""lying"" former boss ""couldn\'t keep his mushroom dick in his pants"". On March 25, the assistant DA countered that ""publicity is not likely to abate [and] the pretrial publicity has been ... exacerbated by the defendant"".[235] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked the appeals court for a delay to allow an attempt to move the trial to a different county, which was denied the same day.[202]\n\nOn April 8, Trump requested to postpone the trial so the court could consider a change of venue, which was denied the same day,[236] and so he could appeal the gag order, which was denied the next day.[237] On April 10, the appeals court denied Trump\'s request to postpone trial on the basis of Merchan being unqualified.[238] On April 12, Merchan denied the defendant\'s request to delay trial on the basis of ""prejudicial"" media coverage.[239] On April 15, Merchan said Trump was ""required to be here"" on April 25 and ""not required to be at the Supreme Court"" that day, when it would hear arguments on his immunity claim in the federal election case.[240] Merchan said he was not yet prepared to say whether trial would be held on May 17 to allow Trump to attend his son Barron\'s high-school graduation, but indicated that he probably would grant him the day off if the proceedings progressed at an expected pace.[241] Trump subsequently complained that he would ""not be allowed"" to attend the graduation, but on April 30 the judge said he would be able to do so.[242] On May 17, Donald and Melania Trump attended their son\'s graduation from Oxbridge Academy at West Palm Beach, followed by a visit to Lincoln Reagan Dinner at the 2024 annual Minnesota Republican convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[243]\n\nGag order\n\nIn a May 2023 hearing and court filing, prosecutors expressed concern that Trump would misuse evidence obtained through pretrial discovery procedure to attack people involved in the case, including witnesses.[211] Justice Merchan declined to issue a gag order or prohibit Trump from publicly commenting about the case against him,[211] but issued a protective order setting rules for the use of social media involving elements of the case, and set a hearing (with Trump to appear remotely) to explain the rules.[244][245]\n\nAt Trump\'s arraignment, on April 4, 2023, Merchan instructed Blanche to ""speak to your client and anybody else you need to, and remind them to please refrain, please refrain from making statements that are likely to incite violence or civil unrest. Please refrain from making comments or engaging in conduct that has the potential to incite violence, create civil unrest, or jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals.""[246] Blanche had stated that Trump was ""frustrated, upset, and believes that there is a grave injustice happening with him being in this courtroom today"" which Merchan rebuked ""I don\'t share your view that certain language and certain rhetoric is just by frustration.""[246] Merchan did not seek to impose a gag order at the time.[247]\n\nOn February 26, 2024, the Manhattan DA asked for a gag order on Trump, noting that Trump has been fined $15,000 for two violations of a gag order in the civil fraud trial by disparaging the judge\'s law clerk on social media, and reporting that police had logged 89 threats to Bragg, his family, or staff in 2023 (as opposed to a single threat in 2022).[248] On March 7, Merchan ruled that the jury would be anonymous except to some involved in the trial, including Trump, his lawyers, and prosecutors.[249] On March 26, Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump, restricting what he could say publicly about people involved in the case.[250] Additionally, the judge warned the defense, under the threat of contempt, against dilatory tactics such as the late filing of pretrial motions or last-minute demands, pointing out that Trump had ""stated publicly that the defense goal is to delay these proceedings ... past the 2024 presidential election"".[251][252] On March 26, Trump made online posts attacking the judge, the gag order, and Merchan\'s daughter, the latter over an anti-Trump social-media post created by someone impersonating her on social media.[253][254][255] The same day, Merchan imposed a gag order forbidding Trump to publicly comment on court staff, prosecutors, prospective jurors, or their families, or to cause others to make such statements, in a way that interferes with the case. Bragg (as a public figure) and Merchan (as the judge) were specifically exempted from protection.[256][257] The court also ordered Trump not to comment on prospective trial witnesses concerning their potential participation in the criminal case.[258]\n\nOn March 27 and 28, Trump again attacked Merchan\'s daughter on social media.[257][259] On March 29, prosecutors requested that the limits of the gag order be explicated regarding family of court staff in hopes of terminating what they considered intentionally defiant behavior by Trump.[254][260] On April 1, Merchan expanded the gag order to protect his and Bragg\'s family members, saying attacks on them ""serve no legitimate purpose"".[261][262] He wrote that Trump\'s continued attacks posted a ""very real"" threat to the integrity of proceedings and could cause those involved in the case to fear for themselves and their families, which would ""undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself"".[263] On April 11, Trump disparaged expected witnesses Cohen and Daniels on social media, referring to them as dishonest ""sleaze bags"".[258] On May 6, Merchan found Trump in contempt of court for the tenth time, but stated that he did not wish to jail Trump due to the fact that Trump was a former and potentially the next president.[264]\n\nContempt hearings were later held concerning numerous alleged violations of the gag order. On May 14, a New York appeals court denied Trump\'s request to overturn the order.[265]\n\nAlso on May 14, United States Senator Tommy Tuberville called the gag order ""ridiculous"" for stopping Trump ""from having a say-so in his own trial""; Tuberville further said that members of Congress were attending the trial ""to speak our piece for President Trump"" and ""overcome this gag order"", and he hoped that ""more and more"" members of Congress would do so.[266] Republican members of Congress, including Tuberville, JD Vance, Cory Mills, Nicole Malliotakis and Speaker Mike Johnson, have criticized witness Michael Cohen, while Byron Donalds, Rick Scott, Vance, and Johnson have criticized Merchan\'s daughter.[267][268][269][270] New York magazine journalist Andrew Rice claimed that during Cohen\'s May 13 testimony, he saw Trump penning revision notes as to statements about the case from his Republican allies.[271] On May 14, Trump commented that ""I do have a lot of surrogates, and they\'re speaking very beautifully.""[272]\n\nOn May 20, speaking outside the courtroom, Trump mentioned witnesses Robert Costello and Michael Cohen.[273]\n\nOn June 25, Merchan lifted parts of Trump\'s gag order, allowing him to talk about the jury and witnesses who took the stand during the trial.[274] Merchan also stated that the gag order would be completely lifted following sentencing.[275]\n\nStatute of limitations\n\nIn New York, the statute of limitations is typically two years for misdemeanors and five years for felonies.[276] Though falsifying business records is typically a misdemeanor, in New York, the charges are upgraded to a felony when used to commit or conceal another crime.[276] Trump was charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, which is a Class E felony (the least severe), whose statute of limitations is five years.[276] On March 20, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued Executive Order No. 202.8 tolling (pausing) the statute of limitations for ""any specific time limit for the commencement, filing, or service of any legal action, notice, motion, or other process or proceeding, as prescribed by the procedural laws of the state"".[276]\n\nMerchan ruled the tolling deadline was through May 6, 2021, thus extending the deadline for the prosecution by one year and 47 days, allowing the felony prosecution to commence within 6 years and 47 days from when the crime was committed.[276] Trump\'s first indictment occurred on February 14, 2017, and the indictment was filed on March 3, 2023, within days of the deadline.[276] On February 14, 2024, Merchan ruled that the tolled period was sufficient.[276]\n\nThe New York statute of limitations provision, CPL§30.10, permits tolling of up to five years while the defendant is continuously outside the state.[276] During his presidency, Trump spent the majority of his time outside New York.[276] Merchan declined to address where this provision was applicable as the tolling occasioned by the Governor\'s Executive Order was sufficient.[277]\n\nOverview of witnesses\n\nProsecution witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Witness Date Function David Pecker April 22 Publisher of National Enquirer April 23 April 25 April 26 Rhona Graff April 26 Donald Trump executive assistant April 30 Gary Farro April 30 First Republic banker Robert Browning April 30 C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Phillip Thompson April 30 Regional Director of Esquire Deposition Solutions Keith Davidson April 30 Former attorney for Stormy Daniels May 2 Douglas Daus May 2 Computer forensics specialist in the Manhattan DA\'s office Hope Hicks May 3 Former White House Communications Director Jeffrey McConney May 6 Former Trump Organization comptroller Deborah Tarasoff May 6 Trump Organization accounting employee Sally Franklin May 7 Penguin Books executive Stormy Daniels May 7 Hush money recipient May 9 Rebecca Manochio May 9 Trump Organization bookkeeper Tracey Menzies May 9 Senior vice president at HarperCollins Madeleine Westerhout May 9 Former Director of Oval Office Operations May 10 Jennie Tomalin May 10 Verizon senior analyst Daniel Dixon May 10 AT&T compliance analyst Jaden Jarmel-Schneider May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Georgia Longstreet May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Michael Cohen May 13 Hush money intermediary May 14 May 16 May 20\n\nDefense witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Date Witness Function Daniel Sitko May 20 Paralegal for defense attorney Robert Costello May 20 Associate of Michael Cohen May 21\n\nTrial\n\nThe trial began on April 15, 2024, with recessed Wednesdays.[278] Trump was required to attend every day of trial barring a court-approved absence.[279] If he chose to testify, prosecutors could have asked him about his civil lawsuits regarding business fraud, sexual abuse, and defamation as well as the 2018 dissolution of his charitable foundation.[280] Attorneys Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles represented him.[281]\n\nThe trial was not televised.[282] Initially, Merchan allowed photographers to stand at the front of the room for a few minutes each morning before the trial began to take photos of Trump seated. Merchan withdrew this permission on May 9 after at least one photo was taken from the side of the table.[283] There are courtroom sketch artists present to capture the milieu.[284][r]\n\nThe temperature in the trial courtroom was a point of contention, with Trump repeatedly complaining that it was too cold, akin to an icebox, possibly intentionally.[289][290][291] Judge Juan Merchan acknowledged that the courtroom was chilly, but has stated that he would rather it be a little cold than too hot, and that climate control is limited in the 80-year-old building.[292][291] Despite Trump\'s complaints, reporters in the courtroom noted that the temperature was not as cold as he claims.[293]\n\nJury selection and opening statements\n\nOn April 8, 2024, the judge gave attorneys a copy of the jury selection questionnaire,[294] with jury selection beginning on April 15[295][296] from a pool of over 500 candidates.[297]\n\nOver the first two days, 96 potential jurors appeared, of which more than half were immediately dismissed after indicating that they could not be impartial. Nine jurors provisionally qualified on the first day, and an additional ten on the second;[298][299][300] from these 19, seven jurors were selected and sworn in.[s]\n\nHowever, two were excused on April 18, one of whom complaining that her friends and family had recognized her from details published in the news.[300][303][304] Trump was reprimanded by the judge on April 16 for gesturing and audibly speaking in the direction of a potential juror.[305][306]\n\nAnother group of 96 potential jurors was brought in later in the week.[304] Twelve jurors, along with one alternate, were selected by April 18.[307] The selection of six alternate jurors concluded on April 19.[308][309] The jury reportedly comprised seven men and five women, who mostly had white-collar careers.[310] The jurors were allowed to tell their family and employers that they were on the jury but could not discuss the case with them.[311]\n\nTrump was described as falling asleep for brief intervals on four out of the first five days of the trial, ahead of opening statements,[312][313][314][315][316] and as being flatulent.[t] Trump has denied dozing off at his trial.[u]\n\nOn April 22, opening statements began.[328] Prosecutors accused Trump, Cohen, and Pecker of campaign finance violations, alleging they coordinated payments to two women and concealed them as part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.[329] During their opening statements, prosecutors said the jury would be presented with a document with a handwritten note in the margin by Allen Weisselberg outlining the hush-money payment scheme.[330][331]\n\nThe defense argued that the testimony of Cohen, a convicted felon, could not be trusted; that the payments were ordinary business transactions, akin to editorial decisions made by newspapers;[332] and that in democracies it is normal for candidates to attempt to influence an election.[329]\n\nContempt hearings\n\nOn April 15, prosecutors asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for three alleged violations of the gag order against him;[307] prosecutors also requested to use the attacks on Cohen as evidence.[298][258][333] By the morning of April 18, prosecutors alleged that Trump incurred seven further violations of the order and requested that he be fined another $7,000.[307]\n\nOn April 23, Merchan heard arguments about whether Trump had violated the earlier gag order when he made social-media posts about two expected witnesses.[334] Merchan criticized Trump\'s attorney Todd Blanche for failing to justify Trump\'s claim that he was merely responding to ""political attacks"" and for failing to provide any legal precedent supporting Trump\'s claim that reposting an article could not be a violation of a gag order; Merchan told Blanche, ""You\'re losing credibility.""[334][335] Merchan rejected Trump\'s position that reposting a news article to social media was a merely ""passive"" rather than active act.[336][v] The defense also declared that ""Trump absolutely knows what the gag order allows him to do and does not allow him to do.""[336]\n\nOn April 30, Trump became the first U.S. president ever to be held in criminal contempt of court, under NY Judiciary Law Section 750(3).[337] (Trump had previously been held in civil contempt, for withholding documents, in the New York business fraud case.)[338] Trump was found in contempt on nine of the ten counts, regarding statements made from April 10–17.[339] Over the next few days, he paid a $9,000 fine.[340][341][342] Merchan said he would consider jailing Trump for further violations ""if necessary and appropriate"".[343]\n\nOn May 2, a second hearing was held to consider four further violation claims.[w] The prosecution said it was ""not yet seeking jail"".[348][349] On May 6, Trump was found in contempt for one of those four claims (when he on April 22 commented on the jury) and was fined $1,000.[x] The judge again warned Trump of possible incarceration for further violations.[352]\n\nThe mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, said that corrections officials would be ""ready"" if the judge ordered incarceration.[353]\n\nProsecution witnesses\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nProsecutors called former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker to testify on April 22, 23, 25 and 26 as the trial\'s first witness, taking most of the first week of testimony.[354] He had been given immunity in 2018 in a federal investigation into Michael Cohen in exchange for information regarding hush money deals.[355] During Pecker\'s testimony, it was implied that former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, who Pecker stated was now living in Australia and suffering from a ""spinal condition"", would not testify.[354][356] It was previously reported that while Pecker and his company American Media Inc. (AMI), the National Enquirer\'s parent company, facilitated payment to McDougal,[357] Pecker refused to personally do the same with Daniels,[358][359] though he allegedly alerted Trump associates about Daniels\' decision to go public with her affair allegation.[360] On April 23, Pecker testified that Cohen used to feed him negative stories about Trump\'s enemies, which Pecker\'s staff would then ""embellish"" and show drafts to Cohen to get his feedback before publishing them.[361] Pecker also detailed how he offered to deploy the ""catch and kill"" scheme, stating that he offered in 2015 to suppress negative stories about Trump and flag efforts by women attempting to sell stories about him.[362] The prosecution cited a state election law regarding conspiracy to defend their questioning of Pecker about his contacts with Steve Bannon, the chief executive officer of Trump\'s 2016 campaign.[363]\n\nOn April 25, Pecker testified that AMI suppressed negative press about other celebrities, which was emphasized by Trump\'s team in their cross-examination.[364] Additionally, he stated that he did not believe Cohen was working for Trump\'s campaign.[365] Pecker discussed his relationship with Trump prior to the 2016 campaign, during which he suppressed other negative stories about him. Pecker detailed how his company, Trump and Cohen facilitated payment to McDougal in mid-2016, in tandem with promising her a ghostwritten monthly column in an attempt to disguise the contract\'s true nature.[364][282][366] In September 2016, Cohen asked to purchase the boxes of McDougal\'s source material (valued by Pecker at $25,000) on Trump\'s behalf. Pecker then told Cohen that he did not want to be reimbursed for the payment to McDougal. According to Pecker, an AMI staff member leaked details of the scheme on November 4, 2016, ahead of the election, after which Pecker released a false statement that AMI had never paid anyone to kill damaging stories about Trump. AMI then amended its contract with McDougal allowing her to speak to the press.[366] Pecker also described a January 2017 meeting in Trump Tower in which Trump thanked Pecker for his work regarding McDougal and another story.[366][367][y] Pecker said his decision not to facilitate payment to Daniels (because she was a porn star) led to it being done by Cohen.[364] Pecker testified he acted at Trump\'s behest and intended to help him win the presidency, despite his own doubts regarding campaign-finance laws.[366][368] Additionally, Pecker said that after receiving a letter from the Federal Election Commission about possible campaign violations in mid-2021, he signed a non-prosecution deal with federal prosecutors for his cooperation.[366]\n\nGraff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson\n\nFour witnesses testified over the latter part of April 26 through the earlier part of April 30.\n\nOn April 26, Trump\'s executive assistant Rhona Graff testified that when she worked outside Trump\'s office in Trump Tower, she maintained contact information for McDougal and Daniels,[369] and that she had a ""vague recollection"" of glimpsing Daniels at a Trump Tower reception area.[370] During her cross-examination by the defense, Graff said Trump was sometimes prone to multitasking while signing checks, depending ""what was going on ... and how important the checks were"".[17][371]\n\nAdditional testimony was also provided by former First Republic banker Gary Farro on April 26 and 30. He testified that on October 26, 2016, he helped Cohen open an account for a real-estate limited liability company. According to prosecutors, the same day, Cohen deposited $131,000 from his personal home-equity credit line, and the next day transferred $130,000 to Daniels\' lawyer, Keith Davidson.[370][372][373] He detailed how he assisted in setting up the bank account which enabled Cohen to make the hush money payment. Farro stated that Cohen was eager to connect with him, and would set up the account in October 2016. Farro also noted that the account was set up for Essential Consultants LLC, the company the payment was made from, and that it was funded through Cohen\'s home-equity line of credit at First Republic.[373][374] According to Farro, Cohen did not want addresses on the checks.[373] Prosecution also presented evidence showing emails to and from Cohen, which confirmed the $131,000 deposit to a checking account 20 minutes after it was opened.[374] In texts between Davidson and Cohen, Davidson provided wiring instructions for the $130,000 hush-money payment. According to Farro, First Republic closed Cohen\'s accounts after the payment to Daniels became public.[375]\n\nApril 30 also saw testimony from C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Robert Browning, who verified the authenticity of C-SPAN videos of Trump, as well as Phillip Thompson, a regional director of Esquire Deposition Solutions, which provided court reporter services for Trump\'s October 2022 deposition in one of the E. Jean Carroll defamation cases.[376][377]\n\nOn May 20, the prosecution tried to contact Browning to see if he would be available to testify again, this time regarding a photograph of Trump with his former bodyguard Keith Schiller.[378][379]\n\nKeith Davidson and Douglas Daus\n\nSee also: Keith Davidson § Stormy Daniels\n\nKeith Davidson, a former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, appeared on April 30 and May 2. He testified that the Access Hollywood tape helped influence Daniels to go forward with her story.[380] According to Davidson\'s testimony, he drafted the $130,000 hush-money agreement, in which he used the pseudonyms ""Peggy Peterson"" for Daniels and ""David Dennison"" for Trump.[381] The agreement called for payment by October 14, 2016. When the payment did not arrive, Davidson communicated with Cohen,[382] who told him that Trump was traveling.[383] On October 17, Davidson wrote to Cohen that the agreement was void and furthermore that he would no longer be representing Daniels.[384] (Cohen would wire his personal funds to Davidson on October 27.)[385]\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Trump was behind the hush-money talks.[386] However, he also acknowledged how Cohen wired the transfer and that he also had conversations with Howard as well as Daniels\' manager Gina Rodriguez regarding the deal. Howard and Rodriguez, who had no direct roles, would encourage Davidson to connect with Cohen. Daniels, Davidson and Rodriguez were also revealed to have received part of the $130,000 settlement payment. Davidson\'s role in the $150,000 deal with AMI for McDougal\'s story was noted as well.[375]\n\nOn May 2, the jury heard an audio recording of Cohen and Trump from September 6, 2016 appearing to discuss paying Pecker for McDougal\'s story, wherein Cohen mentions talking to Weisselberg about setting up the payment and Trump asks, ""So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?""[387] Further audio was played of a phone call in which Cohen tells Davidson that ""I can\'t even tell you how many times [Trump] said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it,"" apparently regarding the payment to Daniels.[157] Davidson acknowledged texting Howard on Election Night 2016: ""What have we done?"", to which Howard responded ""Oh my god.""[158] Davidson explained that this was a recognition that ""our activities may have assisted the presidential campaign"" and that it was ""sort of gallows humor"".[388] He also confirmed that, after texting with Cohen on February 13, 2018, he sent a statement to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo to corroborate Cohen\'s claim of having paid $130,000 to Daniels from his personal funds.[389] Davidson testified during his cross-examination that he had never personally met Trump.[157]\n\nOn May 2, prosecutors called Douglas Daus, a computer forensics specialist in the district attorney\'s office. Daus testified to examinations of Cohen\'s cell phones. Several of the prosecutions proposed exhibits were found by Daus.[390]\n\nHope Hicks\n\nSee also: Hope Hicks § Career\n\nOn May 3, former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified. She said a Wall Street Journal reporter asked her for comment on the alleged Trump–McDougal affair, which is how she learned that AMI had paid to catch and kill the story.[391] She stated that she drafted a statement to respond to The Wall Street Journal, with Cohen offering feedback, but Trump overrode them by telling Hicks to say that McDougal\'s allegations were ""totally untrue"",[392][393] which is how she was quoted by the Journal just days before the election.[394][357] Hicks also learned at this time that the Journal planned to publish details of Daniels\' allegations, with Trump instructing Hicks to deny any affair.[395] Hicks stated that Trump sought to hide news of both scandals from Melania,[396][395] and after the story of the payment to Daniels broke in early 2018, Trump told her that Cohen had voluntarily decided to pay Daniels to protect him; Hicks opined that this seemed out of character for Cohen.[395] Trump sought Hicks\'s opinion about how the Daniels story was being perceived, especially in relation to the negative impact it may have had if Cohen had not paid Daniels before the election.[393][397] Hicks further testified that she had heard Trump praise Pecker on multiple occasions for his negative reporting on his Republican rivals in the 2016 election.[395]\n\nAccording to Hicks, the Access Hollywood tape roiled the Trump campaign.[395] Though Trump tried to minimize its significance,[398] the campaign felt the tape was a ""crisis"".[399] Hicks stated that the tape\'s release stressed Trump because he wanted members of his family, including Melania, to be proud of him and not hurt or embarrassed.[400] In her cross-examination by the defense, Hicks stated that Trump ""is a very good multitasker [who] is always doing many things at once"".[371]\n\nMcConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin\n\nThree witnesses appeared during May 6 and the earlier part of May 7.\n\nOn May 6, former Trump Organization comptroller Jeffrey McConney testified about how Cohen was reimbursed.[401] He testified that Weisselberg instructed him in early 2017 to send the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401][402][403] McConney acknowledged that he told organization payroll specialist (and its accounts payable supervisor) Deborah Tarasoff to record the reimbursement payments as ""legal expenses""; he said he told her these payments were part of a retainer agreement between Cohen and Trump.[401] McConney further stated that starting in March 2017, the reimbursement checks for Cohen came from Trump\'s personal bank account.[401] In 2017, Cohen quit working for Trump after setting up shop at Squire Patton Boggs\'s offices in Midtown, but nevertheless still identified himself as Trump\'s personal lawyer.[401] Numerous invoice messages from Cohen and related emails between McConney, Tarasoff and Weisselberg were shown in the courtroom.[401] Several general ledger documents associated with Trump and his trust were reviewed which showed that Trump made the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401]\n\nFollowing McConney\'s testimony, Deborah Tarasoff, a 24-year employee of the Trump Organization who works in accounting, took the stand to testify. She said the organization was paying for her attorney.[404][401] She described her job duties: ""I get approved bills, I enter them into the system, and I cut checks.""[405] Tarasoff stated that she had no decision-making authority and merely followed instructions, but also acknowledged that she would approve invoices if she got them, including the ones which were sent to Cohen.[402] Tarasoff testified that while either Trump or one of his two older sons could approve invoices of over $10,000 since 2015, only Trump could access his personal checking account.[402] Twelve reimbursement checks for $35,000 were signed by Trump, and Tarasoff testified that they were mailed to Cohen.[402] Trump, who used a Sharpie pen when writing checks, could write ""void"" if he disapproved of checks Tarasoff created for the company[402] (e.g. a $70,000 check to Cohen signed by Eric Trump and Wiesselberg in February 2017, which was voided by Trump).[402] She testified that Weisselberg ""had his hands in everything"".[403] During cross-examination, Tarasoff acknowledged that she not was present for conversations between Trump and Weisselberg about the payments.[402]\n\nOn May 7, 2024, Penguin Books executive Sally Franklin testified. Franklin, whose company published a few Trump books, read excerpts from Trump: How to Get Rich and Trump: Think Like a Billionaire, including Trump quotes, ""If you don\'t know every aspect of what you\'re doing, down to the paper clips, you\'re setting yourself up for some unwanted surprises,"" and, ""For many years, I\'ve said that if someone screws you, screw them back.""[406]\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nStormy Daniels testified for five hours on May 7,[407] and for the earlier part of May 9.[408] She said she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 2006 and detailed a sexual encounter with Trump in his hotel suite after he invited her to dinner.[407][409] Daniels stated that Trump did not use a condom and that during the encounter, ""I was staring up at the ceiling, wondering how I got there,"" despite not having used drugs or alcohol.[407][z] She said she felt like she blacked out during the encounter and was traumatized by the experience.[411][409] It was the only time they reputedly had sex.[412] Daniels said Trump offered to make her a contestant on The Apprentice; she stated that he continued alluding to the idea for a time in subsequent phone conversations, in which he referred to her as ""honey bunch"" and asked when they could meet again.[406][409] Daniels noted that she met with Trump on multiple occasions, with dozens of witnesses,[409] including a visit to Trump Tower and a final encounter with Trump in Los Angeles in 2007.[409]\n\nIn accepting the hush money, Daniels stated that she was not motivated by money (although this appeared to be contradicted by a text message between her and her manager Gina Rodriguez which suggested she was willing to accept the payment).[409] She stated that she had no part in the hush-money negotiations.[409] Daniels also laid out key information about the payment.[409] She maintained her previous allegation that someone threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot, stating that she did not report it because it would have been upsetting to Trump.[409] Daniels stated that any violation of the hush-money agreement would have cost her a million dollars.[409]\n\nDuring Daniels\' testimony, Merchan sustained many defense objections.[409] He repeatedly admonished Daniels for giving answers that went beyond the scope of the question asked, and at one point interrupting Daniels\' testimony, stopping her from describing the sexual position she and Trump used.[407][409] Merchan criticized the ""degree of detail"" on matters such as the floor size of the hotel suite.[406] In a sidebar conference, Merchan agreed with defense arguments that Daniels described things which were ""better left unsaid"" regarding the sexual encounter, but denied the defense\'s request for a mistrial, noting that the defense would have the opportunity to cross-examine Daniels.[407][409] Merchan set confines for Daniels\' later testimony and directed the prosecution to encourage her to give shorter answers.[409] Afterward, Daniels gave shorter answers and hewed closer to the question asked.[407]\n\nWhen testimony resumed, Daniels stated that her lawyer Keith Davidson received the $130,000 hush-money payment, and that she got $96,000 of it. She also acknowledged that she signed a statement dated January 10, 2018, in which she denied the affair, but testified that she did not want to sign it and that it was untrue.[409]\n\nIn its cross-examination, the defense questioned Daniels about her account of being traumatized by her encounter with Trump, suggesting that her pornographic career would have made the event unsurprising. Daniels explained that the first time she realized the meeting was intended to be sexual was upon coming out of the bathroom inside Trump\'s hotel, finding him stripped to his boxers; she elaborated that she was ""not expecting [this from] a man twice [her] age"".[411] Daniels acknowledged that she had contacted renowned high-profile sexual harassment attorney Gloria Allred about potentially suing Trump for the encounter. Much of the cross-examination focused on questioning the accuracy of her allegation that she was threatened in a Las Vegas parking lot, which was revealed to have been disputed by Davidson via texts with Cohen. Despite accepting the hush money, Daniels maintained that her primary goal was to ""get the story out"".[409]\n\nOn May 9, Daniels concluded her testimony after hours of cross-examination.[408] Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Daniels on how she profited from her story and brought up minor inconsistencies in how she has told it.[408] Merchan again denied a defense motion for a mistrial, but would provide the jury instructions instructions limiting the use of her testimony.[413][414] [aa] Trump criticized Merchan for permitting the testimony stating ""He’s [Merchan] trying to make it as salacious as possible by allowing testimony that has nothing to do with the case.""[418]\n\nManochio, Menzies, and Westerhout\n\nOn May 9, Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper at the Trump Organization, testified for about a half-hour. She had provided evidence to the prosecution.[419][420] Tracy Menzies, a senior vice president at HarperCollins, then testified about the accuracy of certain excerpts from the book Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life, which Trump had co-authored.[421]\n\nTrump\'s director of Oval Office Operations in 2019 and former Secretary to the President between 2017 and 2019, Madeleine Westerhout, also began testifying the same day.[408][414] She stated that Republican National Committee officials she was working with in 2016 discussed how to replace Trump as the Republican presidential nominee due to concern about the damaging Access Hollywood tape.[422] She also noted how she set up a meeting between Cohen and Trump in February 2017, and how the meeting led to Trump Organization employees sending reimbursement checks to the White House—which Trump would then sign and send to Cohen—through a circuitous mail system.[423] She was in tears when discussing how Trump fired her, reportedly in response to her telling reporters that she had a better relationship with him than his daughters.[424]\n\nWesterhout resumed testifying on May 10.[423] During cross-examination, Westerhout appeared to side with defense arguments that Trump used alternatives to the White House mail system because he wanted to get mail to people more quickly.[423]\n\nDixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider\n\nFor the later part of May 10, four other witnesses testified.[425] Among these witnesses were Jennie Tomalin (a Verizon senior analyst), Daniel Dixon (an AT&T compliance analyst), and Jaden Jarmel-Schneider (a paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office).[423] In successive testimonies, Dixon and Tomalin would authenticate cell phone records which were used as trial evidence.[423] Georgia Longstreet, another paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office, again testified after previously doing so days prior.[423] Longstreet also showed some of Trump\'s old tweets, as well as texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard.[423] Jarmel-Schneider then showed a chart which summarized 34 business records which prosecutors say were falsified.[423]\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nOn May 13, Michael Cohen, Trump\'s former ""fixer"" and attorney (who is considered the case\'s star witness), began testifying.[426] He would give 17 hours of testimony over four days.[427]\n\nOn May 13, Cohen acknowledged that he, Trump and David Pecker conspired to suppress negative stories and promote positive stories about Trump during the 2016 election.[426] He said his work in this matter ""was at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump"", stating that ""Everything required Mr. Trump\'s sign-off.""[428] By email (shown as evidence), Cohen informed the National Enquirer that Trump did not want them to report his affair with a ""Penthouse Pet"".[426] Cohen specified his role in the Enquirer\'s first catch-and-kill story for Trump, about a Trump Tower doorman who alleged that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.[426] Cohen detailed his role in the hush-money payment to McDougal, stating that he monitored progress by text, phone and the Signal app.[426] He repeated that he communicated by ""phone, email and text"" with McDougal, Daniels and Keith Davidson.[426][9] By text message, Cohen told Dylan Howard that he was making the payments on Trump\'s behalf.[426] He further noted that after Pecker refused to pay for the Daniels story, he took over as funder of ""catch-and-kill operations"".[426]\n\nCohen acknowledged Hicks\'s testimony about the conversation over the McDougal payment press coverage.[426] According to Cohen, he and everybody at the organization had contact with Weisselberg.[426] He further accused Weisselberg of providing him with the financial advice concerning the payment to McDougal, stating that it foreshadowed the way he arranged for the Daniels payment.[426] Cohen said he first spoke to Trump about the Daniels allegation in 2011 after it was leaked to The Dirty, and that Trump called her ""a beautiful woman"" (having said the same about McDougal) and said they had met in 2006 at a golf outing and that she had liked him more than football star ""Big Ben"". Cohen said Trump did not respond when he asked if he had had sex with her and that Trump took him up on his offer to get the story taken down.[9]\n\nCohen said the release of the Access Hollywood tape was viewed as a campaign liability and that Trump afterwards directed him to pay Daniels to avoid ""catastrophic"" damage.[426][9] Cohen said that he viewed supermarket tabloids like the National Enquirer to be influential in reaching voters[426] and that Trump was concerned about the effect Daniels\' story could have had on female voters.[426] Cohen stated that Trump told him: ""Just pay it. There\'s no reason to keep this thing out there. Just do it.""[429] Cohen testified that Weisselberg told him to not make the payment through the Trump Organization and instead to come up with a more creative way to do it.[426] Cohen said that he and Weisselberg discussed processing the $130,000 through one of Trump\'s golf courses as if it were a membership or event fee but they decided against it. When Weisselberg said he lacked the personal finances, Cohen agreed to pay it.[429] Cohen said he suggested the idea of including a clause in the nondisclosure agreement penalizing Daniels $1,000,000 every time she told her story.[426] After Trump\'s 2016 election victory, Weisselberg and Cohen discussed the reimbursement plan in Trump\'s 26th-floor office, and Weisselberg coordinated the repayments to Cohen.[426] A bank statement for Essential Consultants LLC from the end of October 2016 was presented, which showed the $130,000 sent to Keith Davidson and featured a note Cohen said was handwritten by Weisselberg. It showed the doubling of the $180,000 reimbursement—$130,000 for Daniels plus $50,000 for money Trump owed Cohen for paying tech company Red Finch (to poll for the Trump campaign and promote Cohen on Twitter as something of a sex symbol)—so that Cohen would receive the full amount after paying 50% in taxes, plus a $60,000 year-end bonus, totaling $420,000. Cohen said it occurred to him that Weisselberg and Trump had planned this reimbursement scheme in advance and that Weisselberg had said in Trump\'s presence that the monthly payments would function in the guise of a retainer agreement.[430][401]\n\nCohen testified that he aspired to be a personal lawyer to the president but that Trump, instead of granting him this role, significantly cut his 2016 bonus. Cohen said his relationship with Trump was falling apart at this time. He said his work for Trump boosted his personal career, including by securing more prominent clients.[426]\n\nOn May 14, Cohen said he sent the Trump Organization false invoices requesting money for ""services rendered"". He said that, in February 2017, he confronted Trump in the Oval Office over his lack of repayment.[431] He said he lied about Daniels to protect Trump (while also ""staying on Trump\'s message"" by lying about the Trump Tower Moscow project).[432] Cohen testified that, in January 2018, he pressured Davidson to have Daniels sign a false statement denying the affair and payment, which Daniels signed on January 30, and also offered her an appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity.[433][434] Cohen testified that Daniels also wanted an appearance on Fox News\' Hannity, which she did not go through with.[435][434] Cohen also testified that he decided to stop lying for Trump following a meeting he had with his family shortly before his 2018 guilty plea.[435] Before the day concluded, Cohen began defense cross-examination.[435] On May 16, a Trump lawyer accused Cohen of lying that on October 26, 2016, he was on the phone with Trump\'s personal bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and had him hand the phone to Trump, who then approved the hush-money deal. The defense cited phone records as showing that a series of prank calls to Cohen had prompted him to contact Schiller for a call lasting one minute and 36 seconds, which Cohen defended as enough time to handle both matters.[436]\n\nOn May 20, during cross-examination, Cohen confirmed that around October 26, 2016, he helped Tiffany Trump regarding an extortion issue she faced. He said he was also working with David Pecker that month.[437] Cohen made two brief calls to Donald Trump on the morning of October 26,[438] which he said were about Daniels.[439] On January 27, 2017, Cohen told the Trump Organization he would no longer be working at Trump Tower because he was now Trump\'s ""personal attorney"".[440] On January 31, 2017, Weisselberg emailed Cohen with the subject: ""Note and mortgage modification agreement for Trump Park Avenue Condominium."" Weisselberg asked Cohen to ""prepare the agreement discussed"" so Weisselberg could start sending monthly payments.[441] Cohen said that Donald Jr. and Eric Trump signed the checks ""because they were the trustees"".[442] In 2017, he received nine checks for $35,000 apiece directly from Trump, plus two checks from the trust.[443] Cohen confirmed that he lied to Weisselberg about how much he had paid Red Finch, and that his false reimbursement request amounted to theft from the organization.[444][445][446][447] He said he lied in 2018 when he said that Trump had been unaware of the Daniels payment.[448] He said he had no income between his 2018 guilty plea[449] and the publication of his 2020 memoir,[450] but that since then he had earned $4.4 million from podcasts and books.[451] Asked whether he has a ""financial interest in the outcome of this case"", Cohen said he expected to make more money if Trump was found not guilty, since ""it gives me more to talk about"".[452][453] He acknowledged that his name recognition comes from his frequent criticism of Trump and that he was even interested in running for Congress.[446]\n\nDefense cross-examination of Cohen concluded on May 20. Cohen testified that the retainer agreement Weisselberg proposed he maintain with Trump to conceal the monthly reimbursements was fraudulent in nature.[454][430]\n\nThe defense pointed to occasions when Cohen did legal work, and said this was evidence that he was retained as a lawyer under a valid retainer agreement, as Cohen would not do legal work for free, nor would Trump pay in excess of reimbursements. Additionally, the defense pointed out that CFO Weisselberg requested from Cohen an agreement without suggesting it would be a fake agreement: ""please prepare the agreement we discussed so we can pay you monthly.""[455][456][457]\n\nThe prosecution then conducted redirect examination. The prosecution rested its case the same day.[458][459][460]\n\nDefense witnesses\n\nThe defense began its case on May 20, 2024, and rested its case on May 21 after calling two witnesses.[427][461] Trump did not testify.[462][463][ab] On May 22, he stated (in a press interview outside the court proceedings) that he did not testify because (1) he disagreed with Merchan\'s past rulings, (2) he was concerned about being questioned about his own past, and (3) there was ""no case"".[464][471][ac]\n\nThe defense team had initially planned to call Bradley Smith, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as an expert witness on campaign finance law.[473] Smith had argued that the payments to Daniels were not campaign payments and not illegal.[474] However, on May 20, Judge Merchan ruled that Smith\'s testimony would be limited to ""general definitions and terms"" so as to not supplant the judge\'s role to determine what the law is.[475][476] Smith was prohibited from mentioning ""there had never been a case in which anyone had been convicted of a federal campaign finance law violation for the making of \'hush money payments\'"" and from discussing ""that the FEC dismissed the complaint against defendant and the DOJ decided against prosecuting defendant for potential FECA violations"" due to irrelevance.[477] In February 2024, prosecutors pointed out that Smith had previously been barred from testifying for the defense in two unrelated federal cases in Manhattan where the defense had improperly sought to have Smith interpret campaign finance law for the jury: United States v. Bankman-Fried and United States v. Suarez.[476] As a result, the defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.[478][479] Trump then falsely stated that Merchan had not allowed Smith to be called,[480] and Smith wrote that the ""judge\'s bias is very evident.""[481]\n\nDaniel Sitko\n\nOn May 20, Daniel Sitko, a paralegal for Todd Blanche, provided testimony.[482] A chart of phone calls between Cohen and Robert Costello, the lawyer that Giuliani suggested Cohen hire in 2018, was submitted into evidence.[483]\n\nRobert Costello\n\nOn May 20, Robert Costello also testified.[484] Merchan admonished the witness for making comments on the stand objecting to rulings, staring at the judge, and rolling his eyes.[485]\n\nOn May 21, Costello was cross-examined by the prosecution.[486] Emails from Costello to his law partner Jeff Citron and Cohen were shown. In a May 2018 email to Citron, Costello said it was a goal to get Cohen ""on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president"" and said he believed it was ""the clear and correct strategy"".[486][487] When asked if ""the email speaks for itself"" as he had asserted the day before, Costello said ""Sometimes."" He also wrote to Citron about Cohen, ""What should I say to this asshole? He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet."" (Cohen testified that Costello and Trump\'s campaign had attempted to pressure him to realign to their interests.)[486] In an email to Cohen, Costello wrote: ""You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these \'journalists\' are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed. If you really believe you are not being supported properly by your former boss, then you should make your opinion known.""[486] The defense rested its case thereafter.[486]\n\nClosing arguments and jury instructions\n\nLater on May 21, arguments over jury instruction language were held.[486] Merchan announced that the jury would be excused until the beginning of summations on May 28.[486][463] Merchan stated that the closing arguments ""will not be quick"" and that he expected his final instructions to the jury to last an hour.[486] On Memorial Day, May 27, Trump complained that the prosecution would get the last word as ""very unfair"", though this is standard procedure in criminal trials where the state has the burden of proof.[488][ad]\n\nOn May 28, the defense gave a three-hour closing argument including breaks.[492] Trump lawyer Todd Blanche claimed Trump had nothing to do with checks which were written by Trump\'s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.[493] Blanche questioned why prosecutors did not call Donald Jr. and Eric as witnesses despite their signing payment checks to Cohen.[493] Blanche also showed an email revealing that McConnery sought approval from both Donald Jr. and Eric.[493] Blanche alleged that it was Cohen\'s decision to make the hush-money payment and variously branded him a prolific liar.[493] Blanche sought to discredit Daniels\' ambitions, noting (among other things) text messages between her manager and publicist Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard which showed that Howard believed Pecker would pay for her story shortly after the Access Hollywood tape was released.[493] Merchan admonished Blanche for telling the jury: ""You cannot send someone to prison, you cannot convict somebody, based upon the words of Michael Cohen."" Merchan said this type of comment is ""highly inappropriate"" and ""not allowed"",[494] as the jury is instructed not to consider how Merchan might sentence Trump.[495][496][497]\n\nThe same day, the prosecution gave a four-hour and 41 minute closing argument including breaks.[493] Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass described Pecker\'s testimony as ""utterly damning"".[493] Steinglass noted that some key parts of Daniels\' story were proven true[493] and noted that the defense appeared to acknowledge that Trump knew about the Daniels payment as early as 2017.[493] Steinglass stated that it made sense that Cohen was interested in the outcome of the case, noting that Trump dropped him ""like a hot potato"" when their relationship soured.[498] Steinglass argued that Cohen was Trump\'s ""fixer"" and that his knowledge was ""limited to what actually happened"".[493] It was noted that Cohen did not work for the Trump Organization\'s legal department and answered directly to Trump.[493] A footnote from the 2018 Office of Government Ethics form was shown, which stated that ""In 2016 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump\'s attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.""[493]\n\nSteinglass went over phone conversations between Trump and Cohen regarding the hush-money payment and showed a December 2017 check to Cohen signed via Sharpie by Donald Trump,[493] arguing that the latter must have known the purpose of such checks, as his ""entire business philosophy was and is to be involved in everything"".[499] Steinglass cited a 2018 tweet by Trump in which he acknowledged that Cohen was reimbursed for an NDA via a retainer agreement, but said it had ""nothing to do with the campaign"".[499] Steinglass said the defense\'s characterization of the payments to Cohen was undermined by his lack of pay from Trump in 2018 despite Cohen doing legal work for him that year.[499] Steinglass further stated that the payment was made to ""hoodwink the American voter"".[493][500] At the end of closing arguments, Merchan said that jury instructions would be read on May 29 and were expected to last an hour.[493] Trump described the closing arguments as ""BORING!"" on Truth Social.[501][502][503]\n\nJury deliberations and verdict\n\nOn May 29, the jury began deliberations.[504] A few hours in, they asked to hear a readback of about 30 minutes of testimony by Pecker and Cohen; the readback was held the following day.[505] It regarded an August 2015 meeting between Pecker, Cohen, Trump, and Hicks, in which Pecker pledged to be Trump\'s ""eyes and ears"" regarding negative stories about him; additionally, the jury wanted to hear Pecker\'s testimony regarding an alleged phone call from Trump in which the two discussed a rumor that McDougal had gone to another outlet to publish her story.[506][507][508]\n\nOn May 30 at 5:07 pm EDT, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts,[1][509] making him the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony.[510] Merchan denied a defense motion for an acquittal.[511]\n\nPost-trial proceedings\n\nGag order\n\nOn May 31, 2024, the day after the trial ended, Trump told reporters he wanted to have the ""nasty gag order"" lifted.[512] On June 4, Blanche filed a motion to have the gag order lifted, stating: ""Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the government and the Court do not justify restrictions on the First Amendment rights of President Trump"".[513] On June 5, Matthew Colangelo asked that the gag order remain in place to ""to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.""[514][515] Many expected Trump, had the gag order been lifted, to assail trial participants including the witnesses, jury, and court staff, as well as their families.[516][517]\n\nOn June 18, the New York Court of Appeals said it would not hear an earlier appeal by Trump on the gag order, leaving it in place.[518]\n\nOn June 25, two days before the first 2024 United States presidential debates, Merchan partially lifted the gag order permitting Trump to comment on witnesses and jurors, but Trump cannot reveal the jurors\' identities, nor comment about court staffers, the prosecution team nor their families until after sentencing.[519][520][521]\n\nIn July 2024, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a lawsuit against New York State in an attempt to invoke the Supreme Court\'s exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes between two states.[522] The lawsuit sought to block Trump\'s gag order and sentencing until after the November election, accusing New York of interfering with the presidential election in Missouri and violating Missourians\' First Amendment rights.[522] On August 5, the Supreme Court ruled against intervening in the case.[523]\n\nImmunity ruling\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States, supporting presidential immunity for official acts committed by the seated president. Later that day, Trump\'s counsel requested permission to move to dismiss the conviction on the basis that some evidence presented in the trial constituted official actions by Trump.[222][524] This includes 2018 social media posts by Trump, phone records between Trump and Cohen, a government ethics disclosure referencing the hush money payment, and some of Hicks\' and Westerhout\'s testimony.[525][526][527]\n\nTrump\'s motion was formally made on July 11.[527] Merchan\'s ruling will center on whether the evidence presented constituted official actions, and whether it influenced the verdict.[525] If the conviction is overturned, prosecutors would need to convene another grand jury to issue a new indictment.[527]\n\nJudge Hellerstein had previously rejected defense arguments to this effect in July 2023 when Trump attempted to remove the case to federal court, saying that ""the matter was purely a personal item of the President.""[352]\n\nMerchan\'s ruling on immunity was initially expected by September 6. It was postponed so he could consider Trump\'s third recusal motion, which he denied on August 13.[528] The immunity ruling was expected by September 16.[529][530] On September 3, hours before Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request to remove his case to federal court, prosecutors urged Merchan to rule swiftly on the immunity question, expressing concern that Hellerstein might pause state court proceedings.[531] On September 6, Merchan postponed the immunity ruling to November 12.[532] On that day, Merchan agreed to a request from prosecutors to pause the case for a week while they considered how Trump\'s election could impact proceedings.[533][534] On November 19, the Manhattan DA argued that the conviction should stand because no law states that temporary presidential immunity nullifies—post-trial—proceedings conducted during the president\'s time outside of office and regarding activities deemed unofficial to that post.[535]\n\nDelayed sentencing hearing\n\nBefore his conviction, officials in state and federal agencies began preparing for possible incarceration.[536][537] Trump\'s rhetoric and lack of acknowledgement of any wrongdoing is expected to negatively impact the leniency of his sentence.[538] Trump\'s proponents have argued that any sentence restricting Trump\'s mobility or communication with voters could undermine confidence in the 2024 election.[539] Trump was the presumptive 2024 Republican Party nominee leading up to the 2024 Republican National Convention, and the party prepared for a prison nomination broadcast were he to be incarcerated before the start of the Republican National Convention on July 15.[540]\n\nTrump\'s sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for July 11.[541] However, Trump\'s counsel requested on July 1 to delay sentencing to consider the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States released that day.[222][524] The Manhattan DA\'s office agreed to the delay, though it said the Trump team\'s position lacked merit.[542] On July 2, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to September 18.[543] In August, Trump\'s team asked Merchan to again postpone the sentencing hearing until after the election,[544] and the Manhattan DA stated that it would defer to Merchan on this matter.[545] On September 6, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to November 26.[532][546]\n\nOn August 29, Trump\'s lawyers asked the federal court for the Southern District of New York to seize control of the case, complaining that a September sentencing date would amount to election interference.[547] On September 3, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request on the basis that the payments were an unofficial act.[548][549] Hours later, Trump\'s attorneys filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.[550] Although Merchan granted the sentencing delay, on October 14 Trump\'s counsel asked the Second Circuit to reconsider Hellerstein\'s rejection, arguing that it was based upon ""profoundly flawed analysis"" and continuing to assert that instead of being personally prosecuted, Trump was being politically persecuted.[549]\n\nOn November 12, the immunity hearing was delayed a week, to November 19.[551] On that day, the Manhattan DA agreed to postpone sentencing until Trump leaves office.[535] The appeal cannot take place until after sentencing.[462]\n\nProhibitory consequences\n\nTrump had turned over two of the three pistols he was licensed for to the New York Police Department (NYPD) on March 31, 2023, with a third pistol moved to Florida.[552] Trump\'s New York State concealed carry license was suspended on April 1, 2023, following his indictment on criminal charges.[553] New York state law and federal law prohibit people with felony convictions from possessing firearms, and federal law even prohibits people under indictment or information for a felony (but not convicted) from possessing firearms, a violation of which can result in up to 15 years imprisonment, or life imprisonment if one is subject to the enhanced penalties imposed by the Armed Career Criminal Act.[554] [555] As of June 5, 2024, Trump\'s New York firearm license is expected to be revoked after the NYPD\'s legal bureau completes its investigation.[556] At Trump\'s pre-sentence hearing on June 10, 2024, CNN reported that Trump was still in possession of the third firearm in Florida.[557][558]\n\nOn June 10, 2024, Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche attended his probation interview via videoconference.[559][ae] If placed on probation, Trump cannot associate with other convicted felons.[560][564]\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control declined to renew the liquor licenses for Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and Colts Neck, instead issuing temporary permits.[565] The alcohol laws of New Jersey prohibit a liquor license from being issued to ""any person who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude"", typically involving a serious crime involving ""dishonesty, fraud or depravity"".[565][566][567] Though the Trump Organization has stated that Trump is not connected with the liquor licenses, New Jersey attorney general pointed out that Trump is the sole beneficiary of his revocable trust, which owns the licenses.[565][568] A hearing for the licenses was expected to be held on July 19, but was delayed until after Trump\'s sentencing.[569][565]\n\nPotential appeal of conviction\n\nTrump has a right to one level of appeal for the conviction itself, which he is expected to use.[570][462] The appeal would be heard by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, which is the intermediate state appellate court covering Manhattan and the Bronx. If unsuccessful, the next step would be the New York Court of Appeals, the state\'s highest court, which has discretion whether to hear an appeal.[571]\n\nReactions\n\nSee also\n\nArrests of Ulysses S.

Eventually, the judge stropped trying to control Trump – he and the attorney general’s lawyer questioning Trump let him rant, and then mostly disregarded the missives.\n\nThe high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. Engoron has already ruled Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The New York attorney general’s office said they will rest their case after Ivanka Trump’s testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand:\n\nTrump’s campaign comes to the courtroom: The former president’s rhetoric at times during his testimony might as well have been at one of his rallies in front of supporters. He went after the attorney general. The judge. And the “political witch hunt” that he’s been railing against for years now. On the witness stand, the charged rhetoric was even more remarkable, as he attacked the judge sitting right next to him, with James in the courtroom watching his testimony just feet away. “The fraud is on the court, not on me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump gets an angry response from the judge: Judge Engoron tried at the outset of Trump’s testimony to stop the former president from making speeches and instead answer the questions, but it did little to change Trump’s approach. The judge responded by threatening to remove Trump from the witness stand, though that didn’t deter the former president either. “This is not a political rally,” Engoron said to Trump, telling Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise to “control your client.”\n\nTrump acknowledges changing valuation of Trump Tower triplex: The attorney general’s office pressed Trump on the properties central to his identity and brand: Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and other key parts of his real estate empire. The AG’s office attorney Kevin Wallace also pressed Trump on why valuations of properties were changed, such as his Trump Tower triplex, which was devalued on his financial statement in 2017 after a Forbes article found he had dramatically exaggerated the size of the apartment. Trump acknowledged there had on occasion been mistakes, such as the Trump Tower apartment valuation.\n\nTrump’s descriptions of his properties: The former president’s rhetorical flourishes went beyond attacking those who are investigating him. He also took the opportunity to play salesman and play up his properties. One of his chief complaints about the judge is a citation in his decision that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18 million, a number based on Florida tax appraisal records “It’s much more valuable,” Trump said of Mar-a-Lago, “and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes, that it’s biggest value is using it as a club.” Wallace took the answer to pin him down on that valuation. “You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” Wallace asked. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here.\n\nTrump finishes testimony in fraud trial; Ivanka Trump to testify Wednesday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has stepped down from the stand after nearly four hours of testimony in the civil fraud trial against him and his company.\n\nThe next witness will be his daughter Ivanka Trump on Wednesday, after which the attorney general’s office plans to rest its case.\n\nTrump’s attorney Chris Kise said he believes the trial should end in mid-December.\n\nTrump on whether he maintained accurate records from August 2014 onward: ""I hope so""\n\nWhen asked by the Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office whether he “maintained accurate books and records” from August 2014 going forward, Donald Trump said “I hope so.”\n\n“I hope so, I didn’t keep them myself. I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nJudge interrupts Trump\'s ""irrelevant"" answer to questions about Scotland golf course valuation\n\nAs testimony began centering on the valuation of Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland — Trump lobbed an answer that Judge Arthur Engoron audibly deemed “irrelevant” to the question.\n\nThe New York assistant attorney general asked Trump if the description in his 2014 financial statement was accurate for the property — which followed by Trump touting Aberdeen as a oil capitol making the property more valuable.\n\n“Irrelevant, irrelevant, answer the question,” Engoron said speaking over Trump, one of the few times that’s happened since returning from the break.\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to boast about the course.\n\nAs Trump gave a long-winded answer about the beauty of the course, Engoron said he would be following the assistant attorney general’s lead: “If you want to let the witness ramble on, non responsive, repeat himself.”\n\nThe assistant attorney general was trying, unsuccessfully, to get Trump to acknowledge a discrepancy on the number of properties that could be built in Aberdeen.\n\n“It’s sort of like a painting. You can do pretty much what you want to do. The land is there and you can do what you want to do,” Trump said.\n\nTrump questioned about the value of Mar-a-Lago\n\nDonald Trump says he believes Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\n“You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” asked Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nThe valuation of Mar-a-Lago has been one of Trump’s complaints about the judge in the trial, after the judge cited a Florida tax appraisal of $18 million for the property in his decision finding Trump, his adult sons and his company committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nWallace asked Trump if he approved of valuing Mar-a-Lago as if it would be sold to an individual as a resident. “Did I approve it on this? I don’t know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump replied, “I don’t remember that, no” when asked if he explicitly told former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg or former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney to value the property that way.\n\nWallace confronted Trump with a 2002 deed of development rights that shows Trump deeded away his right to use the property as anything other than a social club.\n\nTrump then gave a long aside about Mar-a-Lago when Wallace asked him about not being able to use it as anything but a social club.\n\n“I don’t mind leaving it as a club. In fact, if somebody wanted it, smartest thing to do, have a club and have one member and that would be the member that lives in the club. But it’s much more valuable — and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes — that its biggest value is using it as a club,” Trump said.\n\nWallace showed Trump a 2003 article in which the former president told a reporter Mar-A-Lago will always be a club.\n\n“I think that was said with bravado more than legal intent,” Trump said on the stand.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nTrump says he would on occasion make suggestions on financial docs at heart of the trial\n\nFurther questioning in today’s civil fraud trial turned toward the financial documents at the heart of the trial, with Donald Trump saying he would look at financial statements, and on occasion make suggestions.\n\nTrump says of his statements of financial condition, “I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions.”\n\nThe former president says that bankers didn’t pay much attention to his financial statements, and says that is going to be part of their defense.\n\n“We’ll explain that as this trial goes along. This crazy trial goes along. Because we’re bringing in the bankers. Very big bankers,” Trump says. “They will explain exactly what their process is.”\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to. They looked at the deal,” he testified.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump arrives to court ahead of testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has arrived at a New York courthouse to face questions in the $250 million civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nJudge overseeing Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order on Friday\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order in the trial to extend to Trump’s attorneys after they raised multiple questions about the judge’s communications with his law clerk.\n\nIn a written order Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron prohibited Trump’s attorneys from making any further comments about confidential communications between the judge and his staff inside or outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe judge said violating the order would result in “serious sanctions.”\n\nAnalysis: Trump heads to the witness stand as the latest polls show him leaping past Biden in key swing states\n\nA year away from Election Day 2024, former President Donald Trump is set to testify in a civil fraud trial and separately faces more than 90 criminal charges, setting up the possibility that a convicted felon tops the Republican ticket next November.\n\nBut it’s President Joe Biden’s political prospects that are plunging.\n\nIn another extraordinary twist to a 2024 campaign season that is more notable for court hearings than treks through early voting states, Trump is expected to be called to the witness stand in New York on Monday. This is hardly typical activity during a post-presidency. But Trump was, after all, the most unconventional president.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is absorbing brutal new polls showing him losing to GOP front-runner Trump in multiple key swing states. The numbers will likely ignite panic among Democrats and renew doubts among Americans that the soon-to-be-81-year-old is up to a full second term. If the New York Times/Siena College survey is borne out in 2024, there would be no electoral path to victory for Biden. And an increasingly authoritarian Trump – who is promising a second term of “retribution” – could pull off a White House comeback in spite of sparking a Capitol insurrection with his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020.\n\n“I was concerned before these polls, and I’m concerned now,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“These presidential races over the last couple of terms have been very tight. No one is going to have a runaway election here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, concentration, resources. And so we have our work cut out for us.”\n\nThe coinciding crises facing both Trump and Biden belie the fact that, for all their deficiencies, neither is yet to face a serious challenger from within their parties as they seek the nomination.\n\nBiden’s position is weakening as he tackles cascading global threats such as the war in the Middle East, sheds support over his handling of the economy and sees cracks in the multiracial coalition that first elected him. It also reflects a nation that is divided and disconsolate, and groping for the elusive normality that the president promised three years ago after the pandemic and the historic turbulence of the Trump administration.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nHas a former president ever given testimony in his own civil trial?\n\nWhen Donald Trump takes the stand in his New York civil fraud trial Monday, it won’t be the first time a former president will have given testimony in his own defense in a lawsuit.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did it twice more than a hundred years ago, both when he sued a Michigan newspaper that accused him of being a drunk and later when he was sued by a fellow New York Republican whom Roosevelt had called a corrupt political boss.\n\nRoosevelt won both cases. Trump, by contrast, has already been found liable for fraud by the judge in New York.\n\nThose Roosevelt trials, separated by two years, were each sensational at the time, and they came after Roosevelt’s final campaign for the White House, when he placed second to Democrat Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after splitting with Republicans and running as a Progressive.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is very much still in the arena, and his legal strategy in a slew of civil and criminal cases is tied to his concurrent presidential campaign. He has argued that two gag orders – the one issued against him by a federal judge in Washington, DC, and the other by the civil trial judge in New York – hinder his ability to speak as a candidate.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_investigations_of_the_Trump_Organization', 'Headline': 'New York investigations of the Trump Organization - Wikipedia', 'Snippet': ""In the city case Trump's only witness was the lawyer and accountant who prepared his returns for over 20 years, ...

One of these is a criminal case being conducted by the Manhattan district attorney (DA) and the other is a civil case being conducted by the New York State Attorney General (AG). The DA\'s case has led to two of the organization\'s subsidiary companies being found guilty of 17 charges including tax fraud and the indictment of Donald Trump, while the AG has succeeded in imposing an independent monitor to prevent future fraud by the organization.\n\nBy mid-2021, New York AG Letitia James had joined the DA\'s criminal probe, with the latter convening a grand jury. Prosecutors filed 10 charges against the organization, alleging that it had conducted a 15-year ""scheme to defraud"" the government, and 15 felony counts against longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg—who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 500 times in his testimony. In August 2022, Weisselberg pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against the organization in exchange for a reduced sentence. In December, the organization was convicted of all 17 criminal charges it faced. Evidence including the testimonies of Weisselberg and others indicate that he and other executives—as well as the two subsidiaries—participated in fraudulent schemes, including recording some employee bonuses as pay for contract work. A number of illegal practices were ceased around the time of Trump\'s election as U.S. president.\n\nIn 2020, Eric Trump pleaded the Fifth over 500 times in his testimony for the AG. In November 2021, The Washington Post reported that between 2011 and 2015 the organization presented several properties as being worth far more to potential lenders than to tax officials. Donald Trump reportedly pleaded the Fifth more than 400 times in his August 2022 deposition. In September, James filed a civil lawsuit against Trump, his three oldest children, and the organization for alleged fraud. Additionally, she referred the case to federal criminal prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service. In November, the New York judge overseeing the lawsuit appointed retired judge Barbara S. Jones to monitor the organization, with a trial being held from late 2023 to early 2024.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe financial statements of the Trump Organization\'s holdings are private, and there exist a wide range of estimates of the organization\'s true value. Donald Trump has been accused on several occasions of deliberately inflating the valuation of Trump Organization properties through the aggressive lobbying of the media, in particular the authors of the annual Forbes 400 list, in order to bolster his perceived net worth among the public over several decades.[1] He has released little definitive financial documentation to the public to confirm his valuation claims.[2][3][4][5] It is difficult to determine a net value for the Trump Organization\'s real-estate holdings independently since each individual property may be encumbered by debt.[1] In October 2015, Forbes published an article detailing its decades-long struggle to estimate the true net worth of Trump and the organization.[6] In 2018, a former Forbes journalist who had worked on the Forbes list claimed in an op-ed to The Washington Post that Trump had lied about his wealth to Forbes to get on the list repeatedly and suggested that Forbes\'s previous low-end estimates of Trump\'s net worth were still well above his true net worth.[1]\n\nOn a Schedule C form filed in 1984 for a purported consulting business, Trump reported no income but over $600,000 in unknown expenses. After New York State and City auditors rejected the unexplained expenses, Trump requested a tax trial. In separate 1992 trials, state and city judges ruled against Trump.[7] In the city case Trump\'s only witness was the lawyer and accountant who prepared his returns for over 20 years, who testified that although it had his signature he did not prepare the 1984 return he was presented a photocopy of (the original copy being unavailable); Trump asserted that he had been subjected to double taxation, in response to which the judge wrote that ""The problem at issue is [instead one] of no taxation.""[8] In June 2016 (during Trump\'s presidential campaign), investigative journalist David Cay Johnston argued that the proceedings demonstrated evidence of intentional tax fraud and that Trump should release his tax returns to disclose whether he had repeated such behavior.[7]\n\nIn a defamation case against TrumpNation author Timothy L. O\'Brien, Donald Trump testified in 2007 that ""I think everybody"" exaggerates their property values and that he did not do so ""beyond reason"". He said he would give his opinion to chief financial officer (CFO) Allen Weisselberg, who ""predominately"" determined final values, which Trump called ""conservative"". Regarding one case in which a property increased from $80 million in 2005 to $150 million in 2006, Trump stated, ""The property was valued very low, in my opinion, then and it became very—it just has gone up."" He was unable to provide a reason for this other than his opinion.[9] Between 2011 and 2015, the Trump Organization presented several properties as being worth millions of dollars—in one case over $500 million—more to potential lenders than to tax officials;[10] this was reported by The Washington Post in November 2021.[10] In January 2017, ahead of Trump\'s inauguration as U.S. president, his attorney Sheri Dillon announced that the organization\'s businesses would be transferred to a trust controlled by Trump\'s sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as Weisselberg.[11]\n\nIn October 2018, The New York Times published a lengthy exposé concerning Donald Trump\'s inheritance from his parents, Fred and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. It includes detailed analyses of Trump family financial records.[a] The article describes an alleged tax fraud scheme conducted by Trump and his siblings related to their joint inheritance of their parents\'s real estate holdings, effectively evading over $500 million in gift and estate taxes. The alleged schemes involve money from the companies being siphoned to the children throughout their lives and understating the value of transferred properties.[12][b] The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance announced on the day of the exposé\'s publication that it would review the allegations.[16][17] In mid-2021, Mary L. Trump (a primary source for the exposé) elaborated on how the organization used a shell corporation to siphon money, devaluing Fred Trump\'s ""core business"" to $30 million at the time of his death.[18]\n\nIn August 2018, Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance Jr. was reportedly considering a criminal investigation of the organization and two of its senior executives for their reimbursement of then-Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen for his hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels; the organization recorded the reimbursement as a legal expense although Cohen did no legal work in the matter.[19] In August 2019, Vance subpoenaed the organization\'s accountants, Mazars, for Trump\'s tax returns.[20] In July 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Trump\'s tax records could be released to prosecutors,[21] producing millions of pages of documents, reportedly including Trump\'s returns from January 2011 to August 2019.[22] In November 2022, the DA\'s office (then under Alvin Bragg) was reportedly again scrutinizing the hush-money affair, leading to Trump\'s indictment.[23] Following a Supreme Court ruling, the U.S. Treasury Department released Trump\'s returns from 2015 to 2020 to the House Ways and Means Committee,[24][25][26] and following the committee\'s vote,[26] the returns were released to the public before the end of the year.[27]\n\nIn February 2019, prompted by U.S. House Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) asking whether Trump had ever presented inflated assets to an insurance company,[28] Cohen testified to Congress that Trump ""inflated [the organization\'s] total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed amongst the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.""[29] Following Cohen\'s testimony, in March, the New York State Department of Financial Services issued a subpoena to Aon, the organization\'s longtime insurance broker.[30] The same month, the office of New York Attorney General (AG) Letitia James began investigating the organization,[31] having stated that she intended to do so during her 2018 campaign.[32] By September 2019, the organization was under federal investigation by the Southern District of New York regarding inflated insurance claims allegations.[33] By December, James\'s office had subpoenaed the organization for some records which it subsequently failed to provide for at least 21 months.[34]\n\nCriminal investigation\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 2020, the Manhattan district attorney (DA) had opened a criminal investigation to determine whether The Trump Organization, including any individuals or business entities associated with it, had committed financial fraud. The investigation led to three grand juries being convened, two of which approved indictments.\n\nThe first indictment named longtime Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and two Trump Organization business entities. Evidence against the organization indicated that Weisselberg and other executives—as well as the two subsidiaries—participated in fraudulent schemes, including recording some employee bonuses as pay for contract work.[35] Prosecutors filed 10 charges against the organization, alleging that it had conducted a 15-year ""scheme to defraud"" the government, and 15 felony counts against Weisselberg, who agreed to a plea deal in August 2022, during Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg\'s tenure. Both business entities were convicted of 17 charges including tax fraud in a trial in late 2022.[36][37]\n\nThe second indictment charged Donald Trump was criminally indicted with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in tandem with an alleged catch and kill operation to suppress negative press during his 2016 campaign, largely revolving around the hush-money payment to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.[c] On April 4, 2023, he pleaded not guilty. The trial began in April 2024, and in May a jury convicted Trump on all 34 counts.[40] The judge consented to two defense sentencing delay requests, resulting in it being scheduled for after the 2024 election.[41][42]\n\nSome conservative pundits denounced the investigation, with the Republican National Committee paying some of Trump\'s legal fees, while Democrats generally endorsed it.[citation needed] After Trump\'s indictment, Republican U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan organized a hearing against Bragg, leading the DA to sue him for alleged interference.[citation needed]\n\nTrump Corporation case\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople v. Trump Corporation is a state criminal case in New York. In July 2021, an indictment was issued against three defendants: the Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation, both constituent entities of the Trump Organization; and Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. All defendants were charged with scheming to defraud, conspiracy, tax fraud, and falsifying business records, and Weisselberg was additionally charged with grand larceny and offering a false instrument for filing.[43][44][45]\n\nIn August 2022, Weisselberg pleaded guilty to 15 felonies and agreed to testify against the organization in a plea deal.[46] On December 6, the organization was convicted of all 17 criminal charges it faced, and the organization was fined the maximum allowable $1.6 million.[47][48][49][50]\n\nAsset valuation investigation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Manhattan DA convened a second grand jury the last week of October 2021; it began to hear evidence on November 4, reportedly to consider charges related to the company\'s valuation of assets.[51] By November 22, prosecutors were scrutinizing several of the organization\'s properties for which, between 2011 and 2015, far higher values were presented to potential lenders than were reported to tax officials. In the most extreme case, in 2012, the 40 Wall Street building was cited as being worth $527 million to the former, but only $16.7 million to the latter.[52] Michael Cohen subsequently stated that prosecutors could ""indict Donald Trump tomorrow if they really wanted, and be successful"".[53]\n\nBy mid-December, an accountant for Trump had testified before the grand jury.[54] Prosecutors were reportedly examining whether the organization provided its outside accountants, Mazars USA, with cherry-picked information with which to prepare favorable financial statements to present to prospective lenders. Mazars provided disclaimers with its financial statements for the organization, indicating that the firm had not audited, reviewed, or given any assurances about them, and noting that ""Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.""[55] On February 9, 2022, Mazars informed the organization that it would no longer support the financial statements it had prepared for the organization from mid-2010 to mid-2020.[56]\n\nAlso on February 22, 2022, Bragg told two of his lead prosecutors, Mark F. Pomerantz and Carey R. Dunne, that he was not ready to indict Trump based on the difficulty of proving that he had criminal intent.[57] The two prosecutors resigned the following day,[58] with Pomerantz writing in his resignation letter that there is ""evidence sufficient to establish Mr. Trump\'s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt"" regarding ""numerous felony violations"" and that Vance had directed his deputies to seek indictments ""as soon as reasonably possible"".[59] The New York Times reported that the resignations followed a monthlong pause of evidence being presented to the jury, which was expected to remain seated until the end of April,[60][61] as well as discussions about charging Trump with conspiracy and falsifying financial records (instead of a fraud charge).[57] The most recent evidence heard was reportedly from Trump\'s Mazars accountant and an expert in real-estate property valuation from FTI Consulting.[60]\n\nOn February 24, Bragg recruited his investigations chief to the lead prosecutor role. The DA\'s office was expected to continue debating the strength of the case.[62][63] On April 7, Bragg issued a statement insisting that the investigation was still ongoing, with new evidence being reviewed, and pledged to make the findings public whether or not indictments were made.[64][65] Witnesses were still being interviewed as of late April, shortly before the jury expired.[61][66]\n\nAccording to Pomerantz\'s 2023 book on the investigation, racketeering charges were considered for Trump, with Pomerantz comparing the real-estate mogul to mob boss John Gotti. Trump\'s lawyer Joe Tacopina rejected the comparison.[67][d] Pomerantz also stated that ""To rebut the claim that Trump believed his own \'hype\'... we would have to show, and stress, that Donald Trump was not legally insane.""[69] According to Pomerantz, prosecutors were weeks away from charging Trump in late 2020 for the discrepancy in 40 Wall Street\'s valuation (with the ""absurd"" value reported to tax officials under penalty of perjury being less than the building\'s total annual rent), but the New York City Law Department downplayed this as a standard negotiating tactic.[70] Pomerantz compared Bragg\'s decision not to follow his predecessor\'s lead in prosecuting Trump to a plane crash. Bragg defended himself by stating that ""Mr. Pomerantz\'s plane wasn\'t ready for takeoff.""[71] Pomerantz further argued that if anyone else besides Trump or another former president had carried out the same conduct, charges would have immediately been brought against them.[72]\n\nHush money business records case\n\n[edit]\n\nThe People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump was a criminal case against Trump. On March 30, 2023, he was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury for his role in a scandal relating to hush money payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 U.S. presidential election,[73][74][75] making him the first U.S. president to be indicted.[e][77][78][79]\n\nOn April 4, 2023, he pleaded not guilty. The trial began in April 2024, and in May a jury convicted Trump on all 34 counts.[80] Sentencing was postponed until November 26, 2024. Trump faces a maximum sentence of 136 years in prison.[81][82][83][f]\n\nThroughout the investigation that led to the indictment, Trump accused district attorney Alvin Bragg—the case\'s prosecutor—of having political motivations.[85] Months before he was indicted, Trump declared that he would run in the 2024 presidential election.[86][87] The U.S. Constitution does not disqualify a convicted felon from being president.[88][89]\n\nCivil investigation\n\n[edit]\n\nNew York v. Trump is a civil investigation and lawsuit by the office of the New York Attorney General (AG) alleging that The Trump Organization and several individuals (including operative members of the Trump family) engaged in financial fraud by presenting vastly disparate property values to potential lenders and tax officials, in violation of New York Executive Law § 63(12). A trial took place from October 2023 to January 2024. As a result of the trial, the presiding judge Arthur Engoron ordered the defendants to disgorge a total of US$364 million of ill-gotten gains, among other penalties.\n\nAG Letitia James began investigating the organization in early 2019, with public litigation beginning in August 2020 to support her subpoenas in the inquiry. In February 2022, Engoron ruled in favor of James\'s subpoenas, and that April, Donald Trump was found in contempt of court for not complying with them and Trump was fined $110,000.\n\nIn September 2022, the AG sued Donald, his three oldest children (Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric), former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, former controller Jeffrey McConney, and ten related companies. That November, Engoron appointed retired judge Barbara S. Jones to monitor the organization regarding potential future fraud. In 2023, Ivanka was released as a defendant due to an expired statute of limitations.\n\nIn September 2023, Engoron issued a summary judgment that Trump and his company had committed fraud for years. The judge ordered the termination of the defendants\' state business licenses and the dissolution of pertinent limited liability companies (pending appeal). The trial covered six additional claims by the AG and considered further penalties. In October, a gag order was placed on Trump, forbidding him from publicly disparaging court staff; the judge fined Trump $5,000 and $10,000 for two violations of the order that same month. The defense unsuccessfully sought to dismiss the case, as well as related subpoenas and rulings.\n\nIn February 2024, Engoron concluded that the ""defendants failed to accept responsibility or to impose internal controls to prevent future recurrences"" of having ""submitted blatantly false financial data"" to ""borrow more and at lower rates"". Engoron assessed Donald Trump and his companies $354 million of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (not including interest), while Eric and Donald Jr. were assessed $4 million each, and Weisselberg $1 million. These four and McConney were also banned from leading New York organizations from two to three years; Weisselberg and McConney were also permanently banned from having any financial control in such organizations. The judgment was appealed.\n\nIn March 2024, the New York Appellate Division, First Department lowered the defendants\' required bond from $464 million to $175 million, which would be posted in early April, while staying the bans ordered by Engoron. The bond would later be approved on April 22, 2024.[90] This ruling which approved the bond also resulted in Trump avoiding legal challenges.[91]\n\nReactions\n\n[edit]\n\nSome commenters pointed out the irony of Donald Trump being faced with pleading the Fifth Amendment, which he has expressed disdain for doing, saying it implies a party\'s guilt.[92][93][g] In December 2020, Fox News host Sean Hannity stated that ""The president out the door needs to pardon his whole family and himself because they want this witch hunt to go on in perpetuity, they\'re so full of rage and insanity against the president.""[95] Some news outlets speculated that the president might preemptively pardon his children in connection with the criminal case, although the power only applies to federal crimes.[96] At a political rally on July 3, 2021, Trump appeared to acknowledge the truth of the New York prosecutors\' criminal charges against his company, then described filing taxes as generally confusing; journalist Andrew Feinberg referred to these statements as an ""admission"". A Slate writer compared Trump\'s alleged confusion about taxes to his prior self-proclaimed expertise, for example saying he was ""smart"" for not paying income tax during certain years while debating Hillary Clinton in 2016.[15][97]\n\nIn mid-2021, the Republican National Committee (RNC) agreed to financially support Trump\'s legal defense in both inquiries.[98] In October, it paid $121,670 to a law firm employed by Trump. The next month, a Republican (GOP) spokesperson called Trump ""a leader of our party [whose] record of achievement is critical to the GOP"" and referred to the investigations as a ""never ending witch hunt"" by Democrats.[99] In December, it was reported that the RNC had agreed to pay up to $1.6 million of Trump\'s legal expenses for both cases.[98] Some sources have pointed out that the matters being investigated took place prior to Trump becoming president.[99] Speaking to Hannity on Fox News in February 2022, Eric Trump argued that the investigations were only being conducted because his father was ""clearly the frontrunner for 2024"".[100] In early July 2022, the Washington Examiner reported that Trump was considering announcing his presidential run soon, apparently in order to increase his sway against the ""scathing hearings"" in the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[101] The RNC indicated that it would cut off legal funding for Trump as required if he officially announced his candidacy.[101][h] Later in July, Rolling Stone reported that Trump hoped to use the executive office to protect him from federal prosecution, but ""The law is less clear on whether a president can face prosecution from states while in office.""[103]\n\nIn January 2022, NBC News cited a criminal defense lawyer it employs as a legal analyst, who observed: ""Generally, lying to a bank to obtain a loan can be a crime.""[104] A New York defense lawyer who worked for Cyrus Vance Jr. called a potential trial against Trump a ""logistical nightmare"" and ""unprecedented in a courthouse that has seen many, many high-profile cases over the decades.""[105][i] The director of public information for New York\'s state courts points out that 4,000 court officers (with training similar to police) are employed to uphold public safety if necessary.[105] In the wake of the two lead prosecutors resigning from the criminal case, media outlets and a lawyer for Trump opined that the investigation seemed to be unwinding; some noted that while Vance had confidence in the criminal case, his successor, Bragg, exhibited less interest.[60][63][106] On April 25, Rise and Resist protesters gathered outside New York County Courthouse with a large sign reading ""Indict Trump"".[107] According to a legal expert cited by The Guardian in May, the nature of grand juries often favors the prosecution, with only a majority vote needed to secure an indictment, as well as ""legally sufficient evidence of a crime and ... reasonable cause to believe that the accused person committed that crime"".[108] On a July podcast with John C. Coffee, Pomerantz argued that Trump would have been charged if not for his ""financial and political influence"" and that such an outcome would ""vindicate the rule of law"".[109] In early 2023, Cohen opined that Bragg may not have followed in his predecessor\'s footsteps due to his need to catch up in his new role first.[110]\n\nIn early September, law professor Jessica Levinson stated on NPR that Trump\'s potential campaign for the 2024 presidential election ""will have no legal impact on any of the criminal investigations against him [but] will have a huge political impact"" regarding the rule of law and future elections.[111] On September 22, The Wall Street Journal editorial board—having written earlier in the year that the investigation ""looks like more evidence of the decline of America\'s rule of law""—stated that ""Trump has made a business and political career of getting away with whatever he can, and it\'s easy to imagine he crossed a line.""[112][113] Later in the month, a former assistant DA and asset forfeiture chief in the Manhattan DA\'s office argued, ""This is going to be a very difficult case for the defendants to win. One of the best defenses to this matter is to delay.""[114] New York Times columnist Gail Collins opined that Trump supporters would not be alienated by the former president\'s apparent fraud due to his already being well-known for distorting the truth.[115]\n\nA Curbed article from October about the state of Trump\'s real-estate empire in New York City concludes that ""In effect, his footprint in New York has already been shrinking for years, and James\'s lawsuit, while it may never come to fruition, has already laid that bare.""[116] Michael Cohen predicted that the lawsuit would ""financially destroy"" Trump and lead to his being perp walked.[117]\n\nOn November 4, 2022, citing McConney\'s stated involvement in providing fringe benefits, Andrea Bernstein stated on NPR that ""under New York law, the company is criminally liable if high managerial agents commit crimes.""[118] On November 14, CBS News cited a former employee of the organization\'s accounting department as saying that he knew about Allen and Barry Weisselberg\'s fringe benefits and that the former\'s propinquity with Trump was known within the department.[119] On November 15, New York Daily News asserted that the removal of Weisselberg\'s name from a copy of a page from Trump\'s ledger (provided to a New York City grand jury in 2021) might constitute obstruction of justice.[120] After the defense in the criminal trial rested its case, Reuters argued that the testimony of its witness Donald Bender ""appeared to backfire ... and bolster the prosecution\'s case"".[121]\n\nIn mid-November 2022, CBS News reported that three law firms involved in the criminal trial had received more than $500,000 from the Save America PAC and the RNC over the previous two months.[122] Some political experts have argued that the fallout of the criminal conviction would do little to damage Trump\'s political career due to his not being personally convicted.[123][j] Contrarily, some with inside knowledge of the investigations argue that Trump was personally implicated via the guilty verdict against his company, despite denials of wrongdoing made on his behalf.[125] An indictment or even a conviction would not constitutionally bar Trump from the presidential election.[126]\n\nIn February 2023, The New York Times reported that in 2021 and 2022, the Save America PAC spent $16 million in legal-related payments, some which were directed to firms representing Trump\'s company.[127]\n\nOn November 16, a New York appeals court ruled that Cohen could sue the organization to reimburse legal fees (in the range of millions of dollars) for Trump-related litigation including the investigations by the DA and AG.[128] After the organization\'s conviction in the criminal case, Cohen stated that Trump ""should be very uncomfortable"" regarding his own testimony to the DA\'s office.[129] Some speculated that the conviction would be highly damaging to the company\'s reputation, with a law professor at Pace University calling it a ""death knell"".[130][131] Bloomberg opined that the felony charges would be eclipsed by their impact.[132] New York City Councilmember Shekar Krishnan called for the city\'s parks department to terminate a golf-course contract with an organization affiliate (previously unsuccessfully attempted by former mayor Bill de Blasio in response to the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack), but a spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams pointed out that the affiliate itself was not convicted, so ""ending the contract we inherited would likely still require the city to pay up to tens of millions of dollars to the Trump affiliate"".[133][k] On January 1, 2023, an MSNBC opinion columnist cited the investigations amongst several others in arguing that Trump was likely to be charged that year.[135] Writing for New York Daily News, investigative journalist David Cay Johnston opined that Trump could be convicted on ""easy-to-prove state income tax fraud charges"" based on documents available to the DA\'s office, including Trump\'s publicly released tax returns which Johnston said were ""rich with what the IRS calls \'badges of fraud,\'"" such as ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in unexplained expenses"" on numerous Schedule C forms showing zero income and ""revenues and expenses that [suspiciously match] to the dollar"". Johnston pointed out that the former method was used by Trump in 1984 and (according to Johnston) found by New York judges to constitute civil tax fraud, which he argued that Trump undoubtedly knew before repeating 26 times, thus providing evidence of mens rea (knowledge of one\'s criminal intent).[136][l]\n\nThe Independent pointed out that hours after the organization was sentenced, Donald Trump Jr. made a social-media post ridiculing paying taxes, implying it supports foreign interests, namely Ukraine in its defense against Russian invasion.[137]\n\nSome political experts have argued that the fallout of the December 2022 criminal conviction would do little to damage Trump\'s political career due to his not being personally convicted.[124][m] Contrarily, some with inside knowledge of the investigations argue that Trump has been personally implicated via the guilty verdict against his company, despite denials of wrongdoing made on his behalf.[138]\n\nWriting for The New York Times, Maggie Haberman cited the investigations as being two of several against Trump highlighting his similar defensive tactics, summarized by former U.S. attorney and FBI official Chuck Rosenberg as being that ""he thinks that everything can be bought or fought.""[139]\n\nOn February 22, 2023, Forbes reported that ""new revelations about Trump Tower suggest that the building is—and always was—something of a fraud."" The article cites (1) ""Property records [showing] that [Trump] has been lying about the financial performance of the building since it first opened in 1983,"" (2) financial documents indicating that ""Trump lied about the square footage of the office and retail space at the base of the property"" (separate from the inflation of his penthouse), and (3) ""Portions of a [newly released] 2015 audio recording [which] prove that Trump was personally involved in the efforts to lie about the value of Trump Tower\'s commercial space"". Forbes concluded that ""The Trump Organization lied about the value of its properties to lenders for years, and although multiple people ... participated ... the person at the center of the deceit was Donald Trump.""[140]\n\nOn April 12, Trump sued Cohen for allegedly revealing his confidences and ""spreading falsehoods"" about him, citing the criminal case. Cohen\'s lawyer Lanny Davis argued that ""Trump appears once again to be using and abusing the judicial system as a form of harassment and intimidation,"" while Trump\'s lawyer Chris Kise argued that ""at some point someone needs to hold this serial liar [Cohen] accountable.""[141] However, on October 5, the charges were dropped ""without prejudice"" (reserving the right to reiterate them later).[142]\n\nHouse probe of Bragg\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 20, 2023, three House Republicans (Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, Oversight Committee Chair Jim Comer, and Administration Committee Chair Bryan Steil) sent Bragg a letter demanding documents and testimony related to the investigation. They called Trump\'s potential indictment ""an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority"" based on ""a novel legal theory"" including purportedly expired statutes of limitations,[143] saying the charge would ""erode confidence in the evenhanded application of justice and unalterably interfere in the ... 2024 presidential election"". They set a deadline of March 23 to discuss setting up a hearing before Congress they wanted Bragg to appear for.[144] Jordan defended Trump\'s alleged wrongdoing as a ""bookkeeping error""[145] and asserted that Bragg\'s office was subject to congressional oversight because it receives federal grants.[146] A DA spokesperson responded on March 20 that ""We will not be intimidated by attempts to undermine the justice process, nor will we let baseless accusations deter us from fairly applying the law.""[147][148] On March 23, a DA lawyer called the demand unprecedented and illegitimate, saying it was based on Trump\'s assertion he would be indicted on March 21 and arguing that compliance would reveal confidential information and interfere with the investigation.[149]\n\nThough Pomerantz said in March that he would not cooperate with the House probe,[150] on April 5, Jordan subpoenaed him for testimony about his resignation (initially scheduled for April 20);[151] Bragg denounced the effort as an ""attempt to undermine an active investigation"".[152] On April 11, Bragg sued Jordan over the House\'s efforts—calling them a ""transparent campaign to intimidate and attack"" his case as well as a ""fishing expedition""—seeking to block the subpoena of Pomerantz and requests for other confidential evidence. The same day, U.S. federal judge Mary Kay Vyskocil denied the DA\'s request for emergency relief.[150][n] On April 19, Vyskocil ruled that the subpoena of Pomerantz was valid on the basis that Congress was probing a legislative issue, namely the use of federal funding. Bragg\'s team argued that, though federal funds were used in the case against the organization, they were not used to indict Trump. A lawyer for Pomerantz said his client saw the subpoena as ""an improper attempt to obstruct and impede the pending prosecution"" of Trump. Vyskocil accused both sides of politically charged rhetoric and criticized Bragg\'s lawsuit of being excessively negative about Trump.[151][154][155] The same day, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted a temporary stay against the subpoena. Bragg and Pomerantz were given until April 21 to make further arguments,[155] but that day they recanted the appeal, agreeing that Pomerantz could be questioned on May 12 in the presence of their general counsel.[156] Pomerantz pleaded the Fifth in some of his answers that day.[157][158]\n\nJordan set a Judiciary Committee hearing about Bragg on April 17, broadly alleging that his ""pro-crime, anti-victim policies have led to an increase in violent crime"".[159][146] Mayor Adams and other city officials denounced the Judiciary Committee hearing, which Democrats painted as a Republican rouse against Bragg and C-SPAN opted not to televise.[146][o] Several witnesses were called, including individuals affected by actions of Bragg\'s they disagreed with.[146][160]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of lawsuits involving Donald Trump\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-witness-list-250-million-civil-fraud-trial-starting-week-rcna117958', 'Headline': 'Trump is on the witness list for $250 million civil fraud trial ...', 'Snippet': ""Donald Trump and his sons Don Jr. and Eric will be among the witnesses in next week's $250 million civil fraud trial against the former president and his companies, new court filings show..

He testified against the company in a criminal trial last year and was sentenced to five months in jail. The company was convicted and fined $1.6 million.\n\nThe witness list also named Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen as among the 28 witnesses the attorney general’s office intends to call.\n\nIvanka Trump, a former top executive at Trump’s company, was originally a defendant, but a state appeals court found the claims against her were too old and dismissed them.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, who will preside over the jury-less bench trial in Manhattan next week, partly sided with the AG\'s office in a ruling Tuesday when he found that Trump had committed repeated acts of fraud for years. Trump attorney Christopher Kise has said he plans to appeal the ruling, which he characterized as ""outrageous.""\n\nTrump, meanwhile, blasted the judge he\'ll be testifying before as a ""Trump hating"" judge who has violated his civil rights.\n\nThe state Appellate Division — the same appeals court that dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump — had issued a temporary stay of the trial date of Monday after Trump complained that Engoron hadn’t ruled on some of his arguments. Engoron ruled on the issues Tuesday, and the appeals court allowed the case to proceed to trial Monday.\n\nJames has said Cohen, a former Trump loyalist, sparked her office’s investigation when he testified before Congress that Trump routinely exaggerated his assets in financial documents. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal charges of tax evasion, violating campaign finance laws and lying to banks and to Congress, and he was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nTrump has filed a $500 million lawsuit against Cohen in Florida alleging he breached his fiduciary duty to Trump by ""both revealing Plaintiff’s confidences, and spreading falsehoods about Plaintiff."" Lawyers for Cohen were scheduled to depose Trump in Florida next week, but his attorney Alejandro Brito argued in court Thursday that Trump needs to be in New York because of the AG\'s case.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres will hold another hearing Friday to determine whether to keep the date or push it back to Oct. 8 or Oct. 9. There is also a possibility the deposition could be held in New York at Trump’s request, but that would have to be approved by Cohen’s attorney.\n\nA source with knowledge of the situation said the deposition would still happen — it’s just a matter of when and where. Donald Trump’s attorney didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe civil fraud trial that begins next week in Manhattan could last until Dec. 22, the judge has said. In addition to the 28 main witnesses, the AG\'s office listed 25 more people as potential rebuttal witnesses.\n\nTrump\'s witness list, meanwhile, included 127 names of fact and expert witnesses, in addition to ""Any witness included on Plaintiff’s Witness List.""\n\nEngoron said in a ruling this month that he\'ll hear the case five days a week. James’ office will have 90 minutes for an opening statement Monday, while lawyers for the multiple Trump defendants will have two hours.\n\nTrump and his two adult sons have denied any wrongdoing.

During the day he also called for Judge Arthur Engoron to be disbarred.\n\nThe morning session was a back and forward between sides, with the judge occasionally needing to interject to set things straight.\n\nIt\'s shaping up to be a fiery trial.\n\nIf you want more information about the fraud case, you can watch the video at the top of this post.\n\nAnd this article highlights five things you need to know about the court case.\n\nOur court reporters today have been Nada Tawfik and Madeline Halpert.\n\nAnd our writers were Brandon Drenon, Victoria Lindrea and Mike Wendling.\n\nThanks for joining us.\n\nTrump leaves court and once again gripes about having no jury\n\nDonald Trump seemed in a better mood at the conclusion of the day compared to his earlier statements.\n\nBut he did once again bring up his frustrations at not having a jury in this trial, which he called ""unusual"".\n\nThe judge had earlier told the court that there was no jury because the lawyers did not request a jury trial.\n\nTrump was also non-committal on if he would be back at court tomorrow, saying he might return but would rather be campaigning.\n\nWho is Alina Habba?\n\nDonald Bender is still giving testimony about being an accountant for Trump, but let\'s take a moment to talk about Alina Habba - a New Jersey-based lawyer who the New York Post labelled a ""firebrand"".\n\nHabba is the most Googled name of people involved in this trial (outside of Donald Trump, of course).\n\nHabba has become one of Trump\'s most trusted attorneys since she was hired in 2021.\n\nEarlier in her career, Habba worked as an executive at the renowned New York fashion designer Marc Jacobs. The 39-year-old mother-of-three was a relatively unknown civil litigation lawyer before working for Trump.\n\nSpeaking outside of a Miami courthouse in Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, she fiercely defended the former president.\n\n“The decision to pursue charges against President Trump while turning a blind eye to others is emblematic of the corruption that we have here,” Habba said.\n\nCurrently, Habba holds the managing partner position at Habba Madaio & Associates LLP, located near Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nWhat did Trump post online during the break?\n\nMike Wendling\n\nUS disinformation reporter\n\nWhen the court took a break, Trump took to his Truth Social network to once again rail against the judge and legal system.\n\nHe posted: “The highly political, Trump Hating Judge just stated that expert testimony is not evidence. Well, that means that every trial in American history has to be thrown out and started all over again!”\n\nTrump appears to be referring not to an actual ruling about the admissibility of expert testimony, but to a back-and-forth between the judge and his lawyer this morning about the weight to be given to a valuation by a specific expert.\n\nRemember, it’s the value of Trump’s properties that are key to this trial.\n\nTrump seems to be exaggerating for effect – it\'s hard to believe he really thinks the judge could invalidate the entire US legal system – but surely the former president and his lawyers will continue to disagree with the judge, both inside the court and online.\n\nMichael Cohen, the Trump supporter turned critic\n\nEarlier, the name Michael Cohen was brought up in court.\n\nSo who is he? Cohen is Donald Trump\'s former personal attorney, once known as his ""fixer"".\n\nCohen worked for Trump for more than a decade at the Trump Organization, as well as on the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and at the Republican National Committee.\n\nHe was sentenced to federal prison in December 2018 after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations and related crimes that happened while he was working for the ex-president.\n\nCohen then testified to a grand jury - transforming himself from Trump supporter to Trump critic.\n\nHe revealed details about alleged hush money payments he made to a porn star under Trump\'s instruction. His testimony led to Trump\'s eventual indictment on similar charges.\n\nIn a recent interview with MSNBC, Cohen said this New York civil fraud trial could be a “financial catastrophe” and a “deathblow to Donald”.\n\n“I can tell you this has always been his biggest fear. That he would lose all of his money and he would no longer be considered the mega-billionaire,” Cohen said.\n\nTrump hits out at judge before heading back into court\n\nThe former president just spoke to media for a brief moment outside the courtroom.\n\n""This judge should be disbarred. He shouldn\'t be allowed to be a judge,"" Trump says.\n\nIt\'s one of the same lines of attack he used in his statement this morning before court started.\n\nTrump has also been posting on his Truth Social media account in the past hour, saying once again that this is a ""witch hunt"".\n\nMar-a-Lago worth \'at least a billion\', Trump\'s lawyer says\n\nWhile court takes a break, let\'s look back at some more of what Trump\'s lawyer Alina Habba had to say.\n\nHabba was critical of the real estate valuations given to Trump\'s 17-acre Mar-a-Lago estate on the Florida coast.\n\nLast week, Judge Engoron ruled that the estate was over-valued by as much as 2,300% in one financial statement. He said the estate was likely valued between $18m and $27.6m.\n\nBut Habba says the value is whatever someone is willing to pay.\n\nShe says Mar-a-Lago would sell for ""at least a billion"".\n\nHubba said Trump\'s Doral golf course would also sell for at least a billion dollars.\n\nShe calls them ""Mona Lisa properties"" and says it\'s not fraud, it\'s just how real estate works.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-new-york-civil-criminal-cases-collide-michael-cohen-testifies-trial/', 'Headline': ""Trump's New York civil and criminal cases collide with Michael Cohen on ..."", 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump speaks to the media moments after he was fined $10,000 by a New York judge for his second violation of a partial gag order on Oct. 25, 2023. / Getty Images', 'Full_text': 'On the second day of Michael Cohen\'s testimony against former President Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial, a lawyer with the New York attorney general\'s office objected to a question from Trump attorney Alina Habba.\n\nThe prosecutor, Colleen Faherty, said Habba\'s questions appeared to be ""bleeding into"" issues related to a criminal case against the president, for which Cohen is also a key witness.\n\nCohen is a former Trump Organization executive who was for years among Trump\'s closest confidants. Now he\'s at the center of two cases, a criminal one brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and a civil one brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nIn the courtroom for Cohen\'s testimony Wednesday were Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles, two lawyers who represent Trump in his criminal case, in which he has entered a not guilty plea to 34 felony counts of falsification of business records. Several rows behind them was Susan Hoffinger, one of the lead prosecutors in that case, along with four others.\n\nCohen\'s 2019 congressional testimony, in which he said that Trump artificially inflated his wealth, spurred both of the New York investigations. In the civil case, James\' office is seeking $250 million in what it calls ""ill-gotten gains"" and sanctions that would hamper Trump\'s ability to do business in the state.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in both cases.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump\'s attorneys repeatedly attacked Cohen\'s credibility, continuing an effort that began Tuesday when Cohen acknowledged he lied when he entered a guilty plea to tax evasion in 2018.\n\nHabba said Cohen has ""interjected himself into many cases involving my client.""\n\nNot long after, she asked if Cohen was ever represented by Robert Costello, an attorney who appeared, at Trump\'s request, before the New York criminal grand jury that indicted Trump in March. Cohen said no.\n\nCostello has claimed that Cohen confided in him, and sought to discredit Cohen to the grand jury, saying Cohen was on a ""revenge tour"" against Trump.\n\nHabba asked if Cohen ever told Costello, ""I don\'t have anything on Donald Trump.""\n\nCohen said he didn\'t recall saying that.\n\nDid Cohen ever tell Costello that he would do whatever it takes to avoid jail time, Habba asked.\n\nCohen said he didn\'t recall saying that.\n\nAttorney general and Manhattan D.A. ""working in tandem""\n\nA few minutes later, Cohen testified that members of both James\' and Bragg\'s offices were in some meetings with him. Both offices have acknowledged previously that members of James\' office were assigned to work with Bragg\'s office.\n\n""So the A.G\'s office and the D.A.\'s office were working in tandem?"" Habba asked.\n\n""That is correct,"" Cohen says.\n\nSoon after that, Faherty told Judge Arthur Engoron that she was worried the questioning was ""bleeding into"" the other case.\n\nHabba was allowed to continue. She brought up a book by Mark Pomerantz, a former Manhattan prosecutor who previously led the D.A. office\'s investigation into Trump. The book describes some of what would ultimately be nearly two dozen meetings between Cohen and investigators for the Manhattan district attorney before Trump\'s indictment.\n\nPomerantz wrote that Cohen\'s criminal history raised potential credibility issues. Not mentioned during the testimony, Pomerantz also wrote that he ""thought [Cohen] was telling the truth.""\n\nA light moment came soon after Habba brought up that Cohen testified under oath that he assisted in falsifying valuations, but has neither been named as a defendant in the attorney general\'s case nor the district attorney\'s.\n\nHabba asked if that might be because James\' office didn\'t find him credible.\n\n""You\'re drawing a conclusion that I don\'t know, you can ask Ms. James,"" Cohen replied.\n\nFrom the front row of the gallery, James loudly said, ""objection,"" eliciting laughter.\n\nHabba also attacked Cohen\'s credibility by highlighting what the defense has argued are his motivations for testifying against Trump.\n\nHabba showed text messages entered into evidence in Cohen\'s federal criminal case. In the texts from early 2017, an unidentified person asks Cohen who will be White House chief of staff.\n\nThe unidentified person guessed Trump\'s daughter Ivanka, Jared Kushner and others.\n\n""Keep guessing dopey,"" Cohen wrote.\n\n""Stop!!! You???"" the person replied.\n\n""I will give you a hint….yes,"" Cohen texted.\n\n""omg,"" the person replied.\n\nCohen was not named chief of staff, but he testified that he didn\'t ask for that job.\n\n""I was given the position that I asked for. There\'s no shame to being personal attorney to the president,"" Cohen said.\n\nFrom adoration to animosity\n\nHabba later brought up Cohen\'s many media appearances criticizing Trump, contrasting his public animosity to Trump in recent years with his statements of adoration before Trump\'s election and during his first year in office — when Cohen famously once said he would ""take a bullet"" for Trump.\n\nHabba showed a 2015 television interview in which Cohen said $10 billion could be an underestimate of Trump\'s wealth, and an article from that same year in which he was quoted saying Trump had ""all the qualifications of a great president."" In another article, Cohen was quoted speaking glowingly of ""Mr. Trump\'s character and capabilities."" In a tweet, Cohen wrote he believed ""whole heartedly that only #Trump will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.""\n\nBut in recent years, Cohen has made a career out of criticizing Trump, he acknowledged on the stand Wednesday.\n\nHabba asked if Cohen talks about Trump during every episode of his podcast. He said he does.\n\n""Mr. Cohen, you have financial incentive to criticize Mr. Trump, correct?"" Habba asked.\n\n""Yes,"" Cohen said.\n\nShe finished her questioning by asking, ""Did you ever ask President Trump to pardon you while he was in the White House?""\n\n""No,"" Cohen replied.\n\nIn 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to campaign finance violations and lying to Congress.\n\nCohen was also repeatedly asked about 2019 Senate testimony in which he said Trump never asked him to inflate numbers for ""his personal statement."" On the stand Wednesday, Cohen initially called that a lie, before saying he was mistaken in calling it that. He said Trump never directly asked him.\n\nHis apparent uncertainty caused Clifford Robert, an attorney for Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., to ask Judge Engoron to summarily end the case.\n\nEngoron denied the request. Trump immediately stood up and walked out, his Secret Service detail in tow.\n\nMotion to dismiss ""absolutely denied""\n\nDuring redirect questioning by the state, Cohen was asked to explain further the issue with his Senate testimony.\n\n""He did not specifically state, \'Michael, go inflate the numbers,"" Cohen said. ""Donald Trump speaks like a mob boss. He tells you what he wants without explicitly telling you. We understood what he wanted.""\n\nBefore Cohen was excused, Robert moved again to dismiss the case on the grounds that Cohen, whom he called a key witness, had lied several times. ""End this once and for all,"" he asked the judge just before court was adjourned for the day.\n\n""Absolutely denied,"" Judge Engoron said, adding that there is plenty of evidence in the case, credible or not, and that he doesn\'t consider Cohen to be a key witness. ""No way, no how… there is enough evidence in this case to fill this courtroom.""\n\nCohen alleged in his first day of testimony Tuesday that Trump told him to adjust statements of financial conditions — documents at the core of the fraud case — to arrive at a net worth that Trump assigned himself ""arbitrarily.""\n\nCohen\'s testimony under cross-examination both days was often combative. Cohen several times replied to Habba\'s questions with the phrase, ""asked and answered"" — an objection lawyers sometimes raise, but witnesses cannot.\n\nAt one point Tuesday, Trump attorney Christopher Kise jumped out of his chair. He protested to the judge, saying, ""this witness is out of control.""\n\nTrump questioned on gag order, fined $10,000\n\nWhile Cohen was the focus of lawyers in the courtroom Wednesday, a statement made just outside the doors during a break brought the focus back to Trump.\n\nDuring a mid-morning break, Trump made a reference to reporters about ""a person who is very partisan sitting alongside"" the judge. The judge\'s clerk, Allison Greenfield, typically sits right next to the judge, and during pretrial hearings often questioned attorneys for the two sides herself.\n\nEarlier in the month, the judge imposed a limited gag order barring Trump from making inflammatory comments about court staff after he posted about Greenfield on social media.\n\nDuring the court\'s lunch break, after reporters were led from the room, lawyers from both sides and Trump remained inside for nearly an hour.\n\nWhen court resumed, Trump was immediately called to the stand and sworn in. Engoron questioned him.\n\nTrump acknowledged making the statement, but said it was about ""you and Cohen.""\n\n""You didn\'t mean the person on the other side of me?"" Engoron asked, referring to Greenfield.\n\n""Yes, I\'m sure,"" Trump said.\n\nSoon after, Trump was allowed off the stand. Engoron issued him a $10,000 fine.\n\nAttorneys for Trump protested, saying Greenfield\'s behavior was unusual for a law clerk.\n\nTrump attorney Alina Habba said she ""does not like being yelled at by law clerks who did not earn the robe,"" and said Greenfield\'s "" influence on the bench is completely inappropriate and it should stop.""\n\nEngoron countered that his practice is to consult with his law clerks.\n\n""I value input from both my law clerks,"" Engoron said. ""Every judge does things differently. I don\'t know if others have them sit on the bench, that\'s how I do things. I make the final decisions.""\n\nThis is the second time Trump has been fined since the gag order was put in place. He was fined $5,000 on Oct. 20, because a replication of the since-deleted social media post that sparked the order had never been taken down from a campaign site.\n\nEngoron implied Trump will be fined more if he breaks the gag order again.\n\n""Do it again, it\'ll be worse,"" Engoron said.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-fraud-trial-new-york-10-02-23/index.html', 'Headline': 'October 2, 2023 - Trump civil fraud trial in New York begins', 'Snippet': 'The New York attorney general’s first witness, Trump’s long-time accountant Donald Bender, testified about financial documents from 2011, including discrepancies in the price of Ivanka Trump ...', 'Full_text': 'Fact check: Trump’s inaccurate comments about a ""worthless clause""\n\nIn comments to reporters before the Monday hearing, Trump spoke at length about what he called a “worthless clause” disclaimer in the financial statements that are at issue in the trial.\n\nTrump said, “We have a clause in the contract, it’s like a buyer beware clause. It says, ‘When you take a look at the financial statement, don’t believe anything you read’ — this is up front. ‘Don’t believe anything you read.’ Some people call it a ‘worthless clause,’ because it makes the statement, and anything you read in the statement, worthless. It says, ‘Go out and do your own research, go out and do your own due diligence, you have to study the statement carefully. Do not believe anything.’”\n\nHe said moments later that the clause “immediately takes you out of any fraud situation and any litigation.”\n\nFacts First: Trump inaccurately described this clause, as Judge Arthur Engoron noted in a ruling last week in which he found Trump liable for fraud. The clause does not say “don’t believe anything you read,” its actual language is significantly softer than Trump claimed. And there is no apparent basis for Trump’s suggestion that the clause inoculates him against any litigation at all.\n\nEngoron wrote last week that “the ‘worthless clause’ does not say what defendants say it says, does not rise to the level of an enforceable disclaimer, and cannot be used to insulate fraud as to facts peculiarly within defendants’ knowledge, even vis-à-vis sophisticated recipients.”\n\nHe also wrote that “a defendant may not rely on a disclaimer for misrepresentation of facts peculiarly within the defendant’s knowledge” — and that “defendants’ reliance on these ‘worthless’ disclaimers is worthless.”\n\nHere’s the text of the clause:\n\nThere is certainly language in the clause that suggests that readers of the financial statements should use caution in relying on the listed asset valuations. But the clause doesn’t say the valuations are entirely worthless and does not tell readers that they should simply not believe anything they read in the statements. Rather, it suggests there had been a good-faith effort to value the assets using a variety of reasonable methods.\n\n“You can read it up and down; it doesn’t say, ‘I will lie to you, I will double or triple the value of these things — my statements in here are outright lies,’” CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen said last week.\n\nJudge asks whether testimony about 2011 documents was a ""waste of time""\n\nThe judge in former President Donald Trump’s civil trial Monday questioned whether lengthy witness testimony about 2011 financial documents was a “waste of time” because of statute of limitations applying to the case expired in 2014.\n\nAt the end of Monday’s court session, Judge Arthur Engoron responded to testimony from former Mazars account Donald Bender about the 2011 financial documents, acknowledging that a state appellate court had ruled the statute of limitations only allowed allegations from 2014 onward to apply in the case.\n\nThe defense agreed with Engoron’s assertion, prompting Trump to give a thumbs up.\n\nThe judge’s comment marked a small win for Trump because it showed the judge again recognizing the statute of limitations that had been decided by the appeals court.\n\nAt the same time, however, Engoron did allow the witness testimony about the 2011 financial documents on Monday over the objection of Trump’s attorneys, as the attorney general’s office indicated it would connect the testimony to allegations that fall within the statute of limitations.\n\nBender is returning for a second day of testimony on Tuesday.\n\nIn his ruling last week, Engoron wrote that the fraudulent statements of financial condition were still relevant in the case even if they’re for transactions completed before 2014 because they were submitted within the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nThe judge wrote that the attorney general’s office was not “challenging the loans, the closings, or the disbursements,” but was challenging the financial documents containing false and misleading information.\n\nMonday’s comments addressing admissible evidence do not indicate that Engoron will change that ruling.\n\nTrump\'s motorcade returns to Trump Tower after he attended first day of civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has returned to Trump Tower after spending the day attending his civil fraud trial in New York.\n\nThe trial is expected to last until December 22, according to Judge Arthur Engoron.\n\nAsked if he would return to court on Tuesday, Trump told reporters while leaving court for the day: “We may, I’d love not to. I’d love to be campaigning instead of doing this.”\n\nCivil fraud trial “took me off the campaign trail,"" Trump claims\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed that Monday’s civil fraud trial in New York took him “off the campaign trail” and cast the trial as a political attack against him.\n\nTrump was not required to attend the trial, which is a civil action — not a criminal case.\n\nDespite that the former president attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James’ $250 million lawsuit against him in the same manner that he has railed against the criminal charges he’s facing in four other jurisdictions.\n\nAsked whether he was returning for the trial on Tuesday, Trump said: “We may, I’d love not to. I’d love to be campaigning instead of doing this.”\n\nFact check: Trump baselessly claims federal Justice Department is behind New York civil fraud trial\n\nIn comments to reporters before Monday’s hearing, former President Donald Trump baselessly claimed that the federal Justice Department orchestrated the New York state civil fraud case and other cases against him.\n\n“It all comes down from the DOJ. They totally coordinate this in Washington,” Trump said. He added later in his remarks, “It’s all run by DOJ, which is corrupt, in Washington. Everything goes through them.”\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence that the Justice Department directed anyone to bring this state civil fraud case. The trial that began Monday stemmed from a lawsuit filed in 2022 by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who quickly began investigating Trump’s company upon being sworn in at the beginning of 2019 – when Trump still had two full years left in his presidency. Trump has correctly noted that James, a Democrat, herself ran on a campaign platform that included a vow to take on Trump.\n\nTrump also said in his Monday comments that “this trial could’ve been brought years ago, but they waited ‘til I was right in the middle of my campaign; the same with other trials and indictments.”\n\nIt’s true that a previous New York attorney general could conceivably have pursued the same case years ago, since the allegations pertain to conduct dating back more than a decade — but James brought the case in September 2022, roughly two months before Trump launched his 2024 campaign in November 2022.\n\nTrump faces two federal criminal cases that were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland; it’s fair to argue that the Justice Department is behind those cases.\n\nBut Trump has also baselessly alleged that the Justice Department is responsible for two criminal cases brought against him by local district attorneys in Manhattan, New York, and Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nTrump says he attended the civil trial because he wanted ""to watch this witch hunt"" himself\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he attended the civil fraud trial against him that began Monday in New York so he could “watch this witch hunt myself.”\n\nTrump was not required to appear in court Monday for the trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives. But he chose to attend and sit in the Manhattan courtroom – while giving multiple statements attacking the proceedings as he entered and exited.\n\nHe continued to rail against Arthur Engoron, the judge overseeing his civil trial, saying he should be disbarred after he ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case.\n\nTrump criticizes judge overseeing civil fraud case\n\nFormer President Donald Trump attacked Arthur Engoron, the judge overseeing his civil case, as he left the courtroom during a lunch break following opening statements this morning.\n\nTrump called Engoron a Democrat and “an operative,” saying that the case against him was a “disgrace.” He also attacked the New York Attorney General Letitia James for going after him instead of violent crime.\n\n“We’re going to be here for months with a judge that already made up his mind. It’s ridiculous,” Trump said.\n\n“They waste their time with this, with banks that were very happy that got all their money back. They weren’t defrauded. I’ve been defrauded,” Trump said.\n\nAsked if he was coming back to the courtroom after lunch, Trump said, “probably.”\n\nEngoron ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case, one of the seven claims that are a part of the lawsuit.\n\nWatching Trump\'s body language in court\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has not expressed much emotion in the courtroom for the first session of the criminal fraud trial.\n\nDuring the four opening statements, Trump sat at the defense table between two of his lawyers. He never spoke to the judge. Trump often faced forward, watching the small video monitor in front of him which displayed the opening presentations by the state and his defense lawyer.\n\nWhen Alina Habba and Cliff Robert, who are lawyers for Trump’s co-defendants, spoke without video presentations, Trump looked at them intently. Habba, who represents Allen Weiselberg, Jeff McConney and other employees of the Trump Organization, at times turned to Trump when she was discussing the valuation of his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nAs Trump’s lawyer, Christopher Kise, answered questions from the judge, Trump wrote notes and passed them to him. Eric Trump, who is also a defendant, sat in the front row of the courtroom gallery, on the defense side behind and to his father’s left. New York State Attorney General Letitia James sat in the front row on the other side of the courtroom, behind the former president and about 15 feet to his right.\n\nTrump only once looked at James, as he left the courtroom for the lunch break, turning his head as he walked past where she was seated. Eric Trump stopped and shook her hands using both of his hands as he followed his father out of the courtroom.\n\nJudge pushes back after Trump lawyer attacks New York attorney general in opening statement\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron rebutted attacks from Donald Trump’s attorney Alina Habba against New York Attorney General Letitia James, responding to her opening statement and getting into a debate with the attorney over her claims.\n\nIn her statement, Habba attacked James for saying in her campaign for attorney general that she was going to “get Trump.”\n\nEngoron, who ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case against Trump, responded by noting that the defense already tried to dismiss the case claiming that James brought it as a “witch hunt” against Trump.\n\nTrump intently watched Habba as she sparred with the judge.\n\n“These statements of financial condition were current, current market value. The point is what were they worth then,” Engoron said, pushing back on Habba’s assertion that the inflated values showed what they could be sold for at some point in the future.\n\nAn accounting disclaimer from Mazars, Trump’s former accounting firm, essentially said, “We’re relying on the Trump Organization,” Engoron said. “That’s how I read it.”\n\n“No, your honor,” Habba responded, arguing that the Trump Organization relied on Mazars and “they’re the accountants.”\n\nTrump lawyer claims Mar-a-Lago would sell for $1 billion in opening statement\n\nAlina Habba, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, Allen Weisselberg, former Trump Organization chief financial officer, and other Trump Organization employees, delivered an opening statement in court Monday attacking New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nHabba’s comments echoed Trump — who has tried to tie the civil case against him in New York as an effort to attack him and his presidential campaign.\n\n“Ms. James said she was going to come into office and ‘get Trump,’” Habba said, claiming that the case could have been brought three years ago before she took office.\n\nHabba also criticized the valuations the judge gave for properties like Mar-a-Lago, which the judge valued at $18 million in his ruling last week, finding Trump and his co-defendants liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nHabba argued that if Trump was trying to show a higher net worth, he would have included things like the rights to “The Apprentice” and the Trump brand.\n\n“There would have been the brand, the same brand that got that man elected for president,” she said. “There’s a lot of people in this room that probably don’t like that and that’s why we’re here.”\n\nTrump was looking at Habba as she spoke in the courtroom.\n\nFact check: The Trump campaign leaves out this year\'s crime declines while attacking Letitia James\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign deployed out-of-date crime data about New York City in a Monday attack on state Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the lawsuit in which the former president is now facing a civil fraud trial for inflating asset valuations on financial statements.\n\nIn a news release the campaign distributed shortly before Trump appeared in a New York courtroom for the start of the trial, the former president’s campaign delivered a variety of attacks against James — one of them pointing out that she received a campaign donation from liberal billionaire George Soros, a Jewish philanthropist and Democratic donor who has been a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories baselessly depicting him as a puppet master behind various domestic and international events.\n\nThe Trump campaign concluded the Monday release by claiming that New York crime has “skyrocketed” under James, who took office in 2019. But the campaign repeatedly used crime data from 2021 or 2022 even though more recent data is available — making the crime picture look worse than it is, since the situation with some major crime categories has improved markedly this year and last.\n\nFor example, the Trump campaign said, “In New York City, shootings increased by 71% from 2018 to 2022.”\n\nWhile that’s accurate, the campaign didn’t mention that the number of shootings in the city has plummeted by about 27% so far in 2023 compared to the same point in 2022 — after also falling about 17% for the full year of 2022 compared to the full year of 2021.\n\nIn other words, the Trump campaign didn’t explain that New York City is now well into a second straight year with an improving shootings trendline, and, if current trends roughly hold for the rest of the year, that 2023 will end with a much less than 71% increase over the number of shootings compared to 2018.\n\nSimilarly, the Trump campaign said, “Murders increased by 48% from 2018 to 2022 in New York City.” The Trump campaign didn’t mention that the number of murders in the city declined by about 10% in 2022 and has fallen by about 11% so far in 2023 compared to the same point in 2022. Again, the trendline is well into a second year of significant improvement.\n\nAnd the numbers aside, it’s also highly questionable at best to blame or credit an individual attorney general for the crime situation in their state.\n\nThe number of murders spiked around the country beginning in 2020, when there was widespread economic and social upheaval because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and has improved around the country in 2022 and 2023 — complicating attempts to assign blame for the increases or credit for the decreases to any particular state or local official.\n\nIn addition, the precise causes of crime fluctuations are difficult to pinpoint even decades after the fact; they are affected by numerous factors, from the economy to government policy to sociocultural factors to policing strategies to the corrections system.\n\nTrump posts clips of New York attorney general talking about suing the former president\n\nVideos of New York Attorney General Letitia James talking about suing Donald Trump were being posted on the former president’s social media account while he sat inside a Manhattan courtroom for the civil fraud trial that James brought against him.\n\nTrump is arguing that the case, which began Monday, is politically motivated.\n\nIn one video, James can be heard saying, “Oh we’re going to definitely sue him. We’re going to be a real pain in the ass.”\n\nIn another clip, she says, “What is fueling my soul right now is Trump.”\n\nThe videos are posted on social media platform Truth Social.\n\n“New York embarrassment Letitia James is politically targeting President Trump,” the text in one video reads. “Letitia James is abusing her office.”\n\nTrump\'s lawyer: ""He has made a fortune literally about being right about real estate""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s attorney Chris Kise began his opening statement with an understatement, saying their team has a “very different picture of the evidence.”\n\nKise said the former president’s real estate knowledge made him a billionaire.\n\nTrump continues to look ahead at the monitor displaying his organization’s loan agreements, and occasionally leaning over talking to his lawyer.\n\n“There may be wide variations between different valuations” of certain parts of the Trump Org.’s real estate portfolio, Kise said, but added the evidence at trial will show the asset valuations on Trump’s statements of financial condition comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nIn pictures: Trump in court for civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is at a New York City courthouse Monday for the start of a civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nLast week, a state Supreme Court judge found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The ruling was a significant victory for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a $250 million lawsuit last year alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nSee photos from inside and around the courthouse today:\n\nTrump claims civil fraud case is part of ""election interference"" against him\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed before walking into court Monday that the New York Attorney General’s civil case against him was part of an attempt to harm his campaign.\n\n“This has to do with election interference, plain and simple,” Trump said. “They’re trying to damage me, so I don’t do as well as I’m doing in the election.”\n\nTrump’s claims about election interference are the same attacks he’s made against all four of the criminal indictments against him.\n\nBefore entering the New York courtroom Monday, Trump attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, as well as Manhattan District Attorney General Alvin Bragg and the Justice Department, linking the civil action against him in New York with his criminal indictments, even though they are not related.\n\nTrump is surrounded by his attorneys in the courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is seated in a New York City courtroom flanked by his attorneys on each side of him.\n\nHis son Eric Trump is seated in the front row of the gallery on the defense side.\n\nThere are at least nine court officers in the room.\n\nTrump didn\'t look at Attorney General Letitia James as he entered the court\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is seated in the front row of the courtroom, on the prosecution’s side and next to one of the aisles.\n\nAfter speaking with reporters in the hallway and calling James a “racist,” Trump entered the courtroom through the main doors about 15 feet to her right. The former president walked directly in front of her and did not appear to look in her direction.\n\nHe is sitting with his attorneys Christopher Kise and Alina Habba.\n\nTrump calls the civil fraud trial ""a scam"" and ""a sham""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said Monday that the civil fraud trial against him and his associates that is set to begin soon is a “continuation of the single greatest witch hunt of all time.”\n\nHe made the comments as he made his way to the courtroom where the trial will begin.\n\nTrump went on to attack Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James, saying “she was going to ‘get Trump’ before she even knew anything about me.”\n\n“She used this to run for governor. She failed in her attempt to run for governor,” he said. “She had virtually no following. She came back and she said, ‘well, now I will go back to get Trump again.’ And this what we have. It is a scam and a sham.”\n\nTrump added that his financial statements “are phenomenal,” and claimed, “no bank was affected, no bank was hurt.”\n\nDonald Trump appears in courthouse hallway\n\nDonald Trump walked through the hallway in court ahead of his civil fraud trial. He is talking to reporters right now.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court gives one win to Trump today\n\nThere have been a smattering of attempts to remove Donald Trump from the ballot next year based on his alleged role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court said it won’t take up one of those longshot challenges, rejecting an appeal from John Anthony Castro, a little-known candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nCastro’s case against Trump leans on a post-Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment that says any American official who takes an oath to uphold the US Constitution is disqualified from holding future office if they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” or have “given aid or comfort” to insurrectionists.\n\nThe case was denied without any comment or recorded vote.\n\nThere are still 14th Amendment challenges against Trump in Minnesota and Colorado, which are scheduled for trials later this year.\n\nEric Trump arrives at court\n\nDonald Trump’s son, Eric Trump, has arrived at the New York City court ahead of the civil fraud trial against the former president, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nThe civil trial over inflated assets in fraudulent financial statements come less than a week after a ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron that found Trump and his co-defendants are liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nNew York attorney general: ""No matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law""\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said in a short statement Monday morning, “My message is simple: No matter how powerful you are, no matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law.”\n\nThe attorney general noted that last week, a state Supreme Court judge found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The trial that begins today will determine the amount of damages owed.\n\nWatch the moment here:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n980b6c7f-2a43-4e1c-8c67-e5eeeb5f987e.mp4\n\n00:44 - Source: CNN\n\nHere\'s what it\'s like inside the court where Trump\'s civil trial will play out\n\nThe civil fraud trial that former President Donald Trump will attend today is in the large third floor courtroom: room 300 of the 60 Centre Street building.\n\nPaintings on the wall depict the early courts of New York City, including the popular law courts of New Netherlands in the 1600s.\n\nThere are various computer display screens arranged for the parties, and two large screens for the court and the gallery.\n\nThere are nine rows of wood benches, with two aisles and some chairs on the side. Altogether, available seating exceeds 100 people.\n\nPeople are still arriving.\n\nTrump heads to court for first day of civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump departed from Trump Tower and is en route to a New York City courthouse to attend the first day of the civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nMore on the trial: Opening statements in the trial over inflated assets will begin today. The trial comes less than a week after a ruling that found Trump and his co-defendants liable for “repeated” fraud.\n\nThe former president, his adult children and his closest business advisers are all listed as potential witnesses for both the New York attorney general and the defense. Being listed as a potential witness, however, does not mean they will be called to testify.\n\nDonald Trump and his adult children on witness lists in New York civil fraud case\n\nDonald Trump, his adult children, and his closest business advisors could be called to testify during the civil fraud trial expected to begin Monday in New York.\n\nTrump is listed on the witness lists submitted by the New York Attorney General and Trump’s legal team. The state and Trump’s lawyers need to be inclusive on their witness lists of any potential person they might want to call, or the judge could exclude the testimony.\n\nTrump previously sat for a deposition in the case and said he had little “if any” role in preparing the financial statements that a New York judge ruled last week were fraudulent.\n\nAlso on both lists are Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, defendants in the case and numerous current and former Trump Organization employees, including former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Most of the witnesses have also testified in video depositions\n\nIn civil cases defendants can be called to testify and, if they refuse the jury, or in this case the judge, can use that against them in weighing the evidence.\n\nThe New York attorney general’s office identified 28 witnesses they could call in the case, including Michael Cohen and Ivanka Trump. Ivanka Trump was initially a defendant in the case, but a New York appeals court struck her from the lawsuit saying the claims brought against her were too old.\n\nTrump’s attorneys identified 127 possible witnesses that they would call, including some of the lenders behind the loans at issue in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump fraud trial in New York will start today after appeals court ruling\n\nThe trial in the New York attorney general’s civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump, his eldest sons, their companies and several executives, is set to begin Monday after a state appellate court denied Trump’s motion to stay the trial last week.\n\nThe trial comes in the wake of state Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron’s ruling Tuesday that Trump and his co-defendants are liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The judge will decide how much money the Trumps would pay the state.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James has alleged that Trump, three of his children, his companies and his business executives defrauded lenders, insurers and other entities.\n\nThe judge has set aside nearly three months for the trial.\n\nJudge finds Trump and his sons liable for fraud ahead of civil trial\n\nA New York judge found Donald Trump and his adult sons liable for fraud and canceled the Trump Organization’s business certification last week.\n\nThe ruling came in response to the lawsuit by New York Attorney General Letitia James — a case that is set to go to trial on Monday on the amount of damages owed.\n\nJames has alleged that Trump, three of his children, his companies and his business executives defrauded lenders, insurers and other entities. The state is seeking $250 million in damages, a ban on the Trumps from serving as officers of a business in New York and to stop the company from engaging in business transactions for five years.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron’s ruling is a complete rejection of Trump’s arguments that he didn’t inflate the values of his golf courses, hotels, homes at Mar-a-Lago and Seven Springs on financial statements.\n\nAmong other things, Trump is accused of inflating the value of his triplex apartment at Trump Tower by three times its size, resulting in an overvaluation of between $114 million to $207 million, Engoron wrote.\n\nThe judge canceled the business certifications of the Trump entities that are defendants in the case, including the Trump Organization — a major blow to the business that has been so synonymous with the former president’s personal brand.\n\nA receiver will be put in place to “manage the dissolution” of the corporate entities. There are two New York properties that are part of the lawsuit, the commercial tower at 40 Wall Street and the Trump family compound at Seven Springs.\n\nQuestions remain as to how the receiver would dissolve the properties, if the ruling would impact properties located outside of New York state, including Mar-a-Lago, and if the Trumps could transfer the New York-based assets into a new company located out of state.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1c247874-bca4-408d-a539-93f5f113ce0b', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump delivers heated testimony in New York civil fraud trial', 'Snippet': 'Michael Bachner, a New York defence attorney, said: “Prosecutors will be sitting in the courtroom waiting for Trump to state something under oath that can be used in the criminal prosecution ...', 'Full_text': 'The new FT Digital Edition: today’s FT, cover to cover on any device.

Tom Emmer.\n\nThe trial will resume with Cohen still on the stand Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nThe judge overseeing Trump’s trial said testimony and financial documents about Trump’s $1 billion bid to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2014 could be included as evidence because they support the attorney general’s claims that Trump had a fraudulent pattern and practice when reporting his worth.\n\nIn the July 2014 letter submitting a bid to buy the Bills, Trump claimed his net worth was $8 billion.\n\nThe financial documents with claims in them that Trump had an $8 billion net worth at the time “arguably tends to show pattern and practice of fraud, to use a loaded term,” Judge Arthur Engoron said, overruling the objection from Trump’s attorneys who said the document is not relevant to the case.\n\nBefore the judge’s ruling, the AG’s attorneys and Trump’s lawyers clashed over Michael Cohen’s testimony about the letter. Trump attorney Chris Kise objected to the line of questioning regarding internal preparations for Trump to bid on the Bills, arguing there was no transaction to buy the team, and it wasn’t the basis for any claims in the complaint.\n\nEngoron allowed the testimony involving the Bills documents to be admitted.\n\nDuring a break in the trial, Trump said there was “absolutely nothing wrong” with his bid to by the Bills.\n\n“I was going to buy it, but the team sold for a lot more money than I offered. I offered a billion dollars. The team sold for $1.4 billion as I understand it,” Trump said. “I was a bidder on the team. I had it all financed and everything else that you needed. There was absolutely nothing wrong, and we didn’t even make the deal. It was many years ago.”\n\n“I’m trying to figure out what relevance does this have to this scam case,” Trump continued “It’s a scam. It’s political interference. It’s a fight against a political opponent that’s leading him the polls. This is a scam case.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s office wrapped up its questions of Michael Cohen just after 4 p.m. ET, and Trump attorney Alina Habba is now questioning Cohen.\n\nHer cross-examination is expected to continue on Wednesday. Habba first asked Cohen if he had any medical conditions that would inhibit his ability to testify truthfully today.\n\nCohen responded, “Asked and answered.”\n\nHabba told him his job is to answer questions, and the judge told him to answer the question even if it was asked on direct.\n\nHabba then asked Cohen if he was taking any medications that would affect his ability to testify honestly. He said no. She then asked if any medication was altering his thinking at the present time. He said no.\n\nMichael Cohen’s demeanor in the courtroom completely changed from deliberate answers to questions from the attorney general’s office, and he took taken issue with questions at several points throughout cross-examination.\n\nCohen and Trump lawyer Alina Habba got into a heated exchange over Habba’s questioning about Cohen’s tax evasion charges, after she asked Cohen whether he told his wife about his tax crimes.\n\n“Did you ever tell your wife that you were committing tax evasion?” Habba asked.\n\nCohen loudly objected, raising his voice at Habba over the direction of her questions.\n\nLawyers from both sides also got involved as Trump lawyer Chris Kise objected to Cohen’s outburst and the New York attorney general’s office objected to the question, saying it covered spousal privilege.\n\n“This witness is completely out of control,” Kise said, prompting a laugh from the gallery.\n\nKise argued the question was relevant to impeach Cohen’s character as a serial liar, part of the Trump team’s strategy to discredit Cohen.\n\n“Asked and answered,” Cohen sneered in response to a question about losing his law license.\n\nHabba at one point told him to stop making speeches and answer her questions.\n\nMichael Cohen directly implicated Donald Trump in the inflation of asset valuations to reflect a higher net worth Trump would want to report.\n\n“I would receive a phone call,” generally from Trump’s executive assistant, Cohen said, and he and Allen Weisselberg, then-Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer, would go to Trump’s office.\n\nCohen testified that they would look at numbers “being achieved elsewhere” in New York and recalculate valuations using real estate as “comparables” that were achieving the highest prices per square foot in the city, even though those properties had different amenities from Trump’s assets.\n\nThe other properties would have different ceiling heights, unobstructed views, and were not inhibited by rent control, Cohen explained.\n\n“You could call them comparable, but comparable would imply that they are similar,” Cohen said. “No, they were not comparables. They were just different.”\n\nLooking at Trump’s 2012 statement of financial condition, Cohen said he recalled inflating assets including: Trump Tower, Trump Park Ave., Trump World Tower at United Nations Plaza, the commercial side of 100 Central Park South, the Mansion at Seven Springs, the Miss Universe Pageants and “possibly others.”\n\nCohen said that they would return to Trump “demonstrating that we achieved or close to the number he was seeking.”\n\n“He was the only one who could accept them,” Cohen said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this post misattributed a quote from Michael Cohen.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s attorneys in his New York civil fraud case are appealing the judge’s sanctions against them, which were handed down in late September for repeatedly making legal arguments against the New York attorney general’s lawsuit that were already denied by the judge.\n\nTrump’s attorneys filed a notice of appeal Tuesday following Judge Arthur Engoron’s $7,500 sanction last month, asking a state appellate court to reverse the judgment.\n\nIn his order finding Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud, Engoron also took issue with the defense attorneys continuing to argue the New York attorney general lacked standing, saying their arguments “invoke the time-loop in the film ‘Groundhog Day.’”\n\n“Exacerbating defendants’ obstreperous conduct is their continued reliance on bogus arguments, in papers and oral argument,” Engoron wrote. “Unfortunately, sanctions are the only way to impress upon defendants’ attorneys the consequences of engaging in repetitive, frivolous motion practice after this court.”\n\nTuesday, Engoron put one of Trump’s attorneys on a 15-minute timer.\n\nTrump’s attorneys have also filed a notice of appeal to reverse Engoron’s ruling that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud, which came before the trial kicked off.\n\nDonald Trump’s former attorney and “fixer” Michael Cohen testified Tuesday he and former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg would manipulate the statements of financial conditions, the documents at the center of the civil fraud trial, based on what Trump wanted his net worth to reflect.\n\nCohen testified that Trump would tell him and Weisselberg what he wanted his total net worth to be. Then Cohen and Weisselberg would reverse engineer the asset valuations in his statements of financial condition to achieve that number.\n\nThe net worth amount they’d back into on the statements was: “Whatever number Mr. Trump told us to,” Cohen said.\n\nWeisselberg testified earlier at trial that he doesn’t remember any meetings with Cohen and Trump to discuss Trump’s net worth or financial statements.\n\n“I don’t believe it ever happened, no,” the former CFO testified.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he is not worried about his former attorney’s testimony at his civil fraud trial, saying he’s not a credible witness.\n\n“He has a horrible record,” Trump said outside the courtroom as he exited for a lunch break. “It’s not going to end up very good for him. We’re not worried at all about his testimony.”\n\nTrump again said his assets are far above what his financial statements indicated, as he has done many times during the trial, which is in its fourth week.\n\nCohen, meanwhile, walking out for the lunch break, told reporters that his appearance is a “heck of a reunion.”\n\nHe will return to the stand when the hearing resumes.\n\nMichael Cohen began his testimony with questions from Colleen Faherty of the New York attorney general’s office about the crimes he pleaded guilty to in 2018, including tax crimes, campaign violations and lying to Congress.\n\nCohen gave a lengthy answer about those crimes why he made public statements about the legitimacy of his conviction.\n\nCohen previously testified before Congress in 2019 about Trump’s involvement in the hush-money scheme involving both former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who alleged having affairs with Trump (Trump has denied the affairs).\n\n“I acknowledge my complicity in the Stormy Daniels matter, but I never paid Karen McDougal,” Cohen said, explaining the payments to McDougal were made through AMI, the former owner of the National Enquirer.\n\nTrump did not react when Cohen raised the hush-money payments and stared straight ahead at Cohen.\n\nCohen also said he lied to Congress when he testified in 2017 about how many times he spoke to Donald Trump about a Trump Tower Moscow project, when he said it was only three discussions and it was actually 10.\n\nHe said that statement was drafted in discussions with a list of people in Trump’s camp including Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Trump Org. legal counsel Alan Garten and others. Trump attorney Chris Kise objected to that statement, which was overruled by Judge Arthur Engoron.\n\nCohen said he felt he had to address the public information.\n\n“When all of this started, it was overwhelming. The amount of disinformation misinformation, mal-information about me. It was overwhelming and enormous,” he said.\n\nDespite public statements pushing back on the federal charges against him over the years, Cohen confirmed he eventually pleaded guilty and served a sentence taking responsibility for each of the counts he pleaded guilty to.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron clashed with Donald Trump’s attorneys over the cross-examination of the general counsel for Trump’s former accounting firm after Engoron put Trump’s attorney Jesus Suarez on a 15-minute timer.\n\nDuring the cross-examination of Mazars general counsel Bill Kelly, Engoron grew impatient at several points, asking Suarez how much more he had planned.\n\nAfter returning from a break, Suarez had Kelly confirm that Mazars did not identify material discrepancies in Trump’s statements of financial conditions at the time, even after years of investigations by the district attorney, attorney general and congressional Democrats.\n\nBut Colleen Faherty of the attorney general’s office objected to the repeated line of questioning. Engoron then put a timer on for 15 minutes because Suarez said that’s all he needed.\n\nTrump attorney Chris Kise responded that the judge has never timed the questioning by the attorney general and that his colleague should not be rushed in questioning Kelly.\n\nTrump was visibly angry, talking and gesturing to Kise at the defense table.\n\nTrump attorney Chris Kise objected at the start of Tuesday’s proceedings, telling the court that four members of the NY attorney general’s staff tested positive for Covid and complained that there was no mention of it until the weekend.\n\n“The leading candidate for president of the United States” is here, Kise said.\n\nKise alleged that Attorney General Letitia James knew about the risk at least as of last Wednesday but there was no mention of it. He said the court was not notified until Saturday and said four AG team members have tested positive.\n\nAnother Trump attorney also confirmed a member of the former president’s team tested positive.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron said court will proceed and commented, “I understand what you’re saying. I understand your concerns.” He added that masks are available.\n\nNeither Trump nor anyone on his legal team is wearing a mask, and neither is James. Only a handful of people in the gallery are wearing masks.\n\nTrump’s attorneys also objected to using the same microphone to question witnesses as the district attorney’s office. Trump lawyer Jesus Suarez was given a wireless microphone when he started his cross-examination of the first witness on Tuesday.\n\nThe NY Attorney General’s office said it followed US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.\n\n“As always, the Attorney General’s Office has followed and complied with CDC guidelines. Our office properly notified the court and defendants’ counsel, and the court decided to proceed with trial today,” a spokesman from the AG’s office said. “If there were any concerns, defendants’ could wear masks today or at any point, but they have opted not to.”\n\nThe first witness Tuesday for the New York attorney general’s office is Bill Kelly, the general counsel of Mazars, the accounting firm used by Donald Trump and the Trump Organization.\n\nKelly testified that Mazars determined the company could still work with Trump Org. when it first received a congressional subpoena in 2019 and as it received additional subpoenas thereafter.\n\nMazars continued to work with Trump Org. until they received a subpoena in May 2021 when it learned the Manhattan District Attorney’s office was investigating Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg.\n\n“If we can no longer rely on him as CFO we can no longer perform those services,” Kelly said.\n\nTrump is following along with Kelly’s testimony though not reacting to it. He’s alternating between leaning back and sitting up to look at documents on the screen in front of him as they are shown by the attorney general’s office.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump called his former attorney Michael Cohen a “proven liar” as he entered court Tuesday morning.\n\n“He’s a proven liar,” Trump said. “He’s a felon. He has served a lot of time for lying and we’re just going to go in and see.”\n\nCohen says his lies were made at Trump’s direction.\n\nTrump again complained about the trial and said he’s done nothing wrong.\n\n“This case by any other judge, this case would have been over a long time ago,” Trump said.\n\nCohen previously pleaded guilty and served prison time for nine federal crimes including tax fraud, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations for helping pay off two women who threatened to go public with past alleged affairs with Trump just before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the affairs.\n\nMichael Cohen was once one of Donald Trump’s most loyal allies.\n\nBut after going to jail for tax crimes and lying to Congress, Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and “fixer,” became a star witness against his former boss, testifying before Congress about the hush-money payments he made to women claiming affairs with Trump and writing books highly critical of the former president.\n\nTuesday, Trump and Cohen are expected to be face to face in a New York courtroom as Cohen delivers testimony as part of the New York attorney general’s civil fraud case against the former president.\n\nWhen Cohen takes the stand, he will face down a very angry Donald Trump. It’s the first time the two have been in the same room or even spoken in five years, according to multiple sources.\n\nCohen’s testimony is the latest high-profile moment in the civil fraud trial, in which New York Attorney General Letitia James is seeking to bar Trump from doing business in the state. While Trump has played only a passive role in the trial to date, he is expected to be called as a witness later on.\n\nTrump voluntarily attended the civil trial’s opening days, and the former president returned last week, when Cohen was initially supposed to be called to testify, though Cohen’s appearance was delayed after he cited a medical issue.\n\nTrump is also returning to the courtroom after he was fined $5,000 last week by Judge Arthur Engoron – and warned about possible imprisonment – for violating a gag order not to speak about any members of the court staff. Engoron fined Trump over a social media post attacking Engoron’s clerk that had not been removed from Trump’s campaign website.\n\nCohen is expected to testify about meetings with former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and Trump regarding Trump’s financial statements and net worth. Cohen has claimed there were meetings with Weisselberg and Trump about Trump’s net worth before the financial statements were filed. Weisselberg testified earlier in the trial, “I don’t believe it ever happened, no.”\n\nRead more about Cohen’s pending testimony here.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was fined $5,000 by a New York judge on Friday for violating a gag order not to speak about any members of the court staff — and was warned twice about possible imprisonment.\n\n“Donald Trump has received ample warning from this Court as to the possible repercussions of violating the gag order. He specifically acknowledged that he understood and would abide by it,” Judge Arthur Engoron said in his order last week.\n\nOn the second day of the trial, October 3, Engoron issued a partial gag order on all parties not to speak about any members of the court staff after Trump posted on Truth Social attacking Engoron’s clerk. The post claimed she was a “girlfriend” to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, showing a picture of the two of them together.\n\nThe post was removed from Truth Social right after the gag order was issued, but it was not erased from Trump’s campaign website, DonaldJTrump.com.\n\nIn court, Engoron admonished the former president’s attorneys for a “blatant violation” of the gag order and suggested that violations could result in “imprisonment.”\n\n“I learned that the subject post was never removed from the website,” he said. “And, in fact, had been on that website for the past 17 days. I understand that it was removed late last night but only in response to an email.”\n\nTrump attorney Chris Kise apologized to Engoron, saying it was “inadvertent” that the post was able to live on what he called a “back page” of Trump’s campaign website.\n\nKise blamed it on the large machinery of the campaign and was assured the judge that Trump ordered the post removed.'}}",93.0,1

The Trump campaign did not answer an inquiry for this article.\n\nSome of the statistics cited on projections at Donald Trump’s rally Dec. 16, 2023, in Durham, N.H. (Rebecca Catalanello/PolitiFact)\n\n""Under Joe Biden, we’ve had a three-year inflation rate of 20%.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe standard inflation measure, the consumer price index, has risen by 17.2% since January 2021, when Biden took office. That was an increase over three years, so the annual inflation rate was lower — about 5.9% per year during Biden’s presidency.\n\nRising wages have helped consumers manage some of this increase in prices.\n\nA standard wage measure, average hourly earnings of all private-sector employees, has risen by 14% during Biden’s presidency, or about 4.8% per year. That means wages are still trailing inflation by about 1.1% a year, but it’s a smaller gap than Trump’s headline number.\n\nThe time frame for the calculation also matters.\n\nAs inflation has cooled over the past year, wage gains have narrowed the cumulative shortfall from inflation. Since November 2022, inflation has risen by 3.1%, but wages have risen by 4%. If the pattern holds, wage growth during Biden’s presidency may soon surpass the increase in prices.\n\nAlso, Americans are in a better place than they were on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, which started during Trump’s last year in office. Since February 2020, the last full month before the pandemic hit, inflation has increased by 18.8%, while wages have increased by 19.4%.\n\n""After three years of Bidenomics, the 30-year mortgage rate has hit a 22-year high.""\n\nThis is Mostly True. Numerically, Trump is on target. However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage peaked at 7.79% on Oct. 26, 2023. That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.\n\nMortgage rates have spiked because the Federal Reserve in March 2022 began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Fed interest rate hikes are considered the most effective economic tools for curbing inflation, because they tend to cool the economy, which eases demand and lowers prices.\n\nSince the Fed hikes began, inflation has receded by about two-thirds. But a side effect has been that other types of interest rates — including mortgages — have also risen.\n\nSince the mortgage rate peak in October, the average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has fallen, hitting 6.67% on Dec. 21. Not counting the peak in recent months, that’s still higher than any rate going back to Aug. 2, 2007, when the rate was 6.68%.\n\nEconomists generally agree that some of Biden’s policies likely added to the pressures that pushed up prices.\n\nBiden’s coronavirus relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, put stimulus money into Americans’ hands when supply chains couldn’t produce enough goods to fulfill consumer demand. This worsened the rise of prices, which started because of pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions.\n\nHowever, ""the drivers of this inflation go back to COVID-19 — issues like supply-chain constraints, workforce shortages, and other factors,"" John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, told PolitiFact West Virginia in October. ""That is much larger than any particular Biden policy.""\n\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said Biden should ""assume some responsibility, but so should members of Congress who voted in favor of stimulus payments, tax cuts, generous unemployment benefits, aid to states and private businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic recession.""\n\nThe American Rescue Plan got no Republican support in Congress, but earlier pandemic relief bills Trump signed were passed with bipartisan support.\n\n""The average monthly mortgage payment: Under Trump, $1,746; Under Biden: $3,322.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThese are the figures for average monthly payments on a new home, real estate company CBRE reports. That’s a significant out-of-pocket increase for someone buying a new home, but it doesn’t affect homeowners who aren’t looking to move.\n\nThe figure is calculated for the purchase of a new home valued at the U.S. median of $430,000, with a 10% down payment.\n\nThe majority of American mortgage holders have fixed-rate mortgages that were locked in at much lower rates. In 2022, about 85% of mortgages had fixed rates.\n\nGiven the current high rates, adjustable-rate mortgages are gaining popularity. If mortgage rates decrease in 2024, homeowners who hold adjustable-rate mortgages should see their payments drop.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://heavy.com/news/biden-beat-trump-in-tv-town-hall-views-while-tiktok-helped-biden-online/', 'Headline': 'Trump vs Biden Town Hall: Who Got the Most Views Online & on TV?', 'Snippet': 'Biden’s town hall had 12.3 million total viewers with an average 2.6 rating in the 18-24 demographic, TV Line reported.

The views expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nPaul Begala: Trump whined, griped and complained\n\nMore than 400,000 Americans died from Covid-19 during the Trump presidency. 2.9 million Americans lost their jobs while former President Donald Trump was in the White House. Opioid deaths skyrocketed, and the national debt exploded by $7 trillion during Trump’s tenure.\n\nBut in tonight’s CNN town hall, Trump told us who the real victim of this era is: Donald Trump.\n\nFrom the opening question to his last comment, Trump whined, griped and complained. It was an airing of grievances that will doubtless thrill his MAGA base, but may well motivate anti-Trump voters just as much. And there’s little indication he did enough to win over independent voters.\n\nThis was vintage Trump: whining about the election he lost, grumbling about being indicted in New York, moaning about the jury that found him liable for the civil offense of sexual abuse and defamation. He used the first-person pronoun in nearly every sentence, sounding like a tenor warming up for the opera: “Me, me, me, me, meeeeee.”\n\nHe failed to acknowledge the very real pain felt by so many Americans – including the millions who voted for him. There was not a hint of empathy for the heroic cops who were brutally attacked on January 6. Not a mention of the struggling rural families wrestling with the demon of opioid abuse. Not a word of thanks for veterans and their families. Not a thought for the tens of millions of women whose rights have been rolled back by Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices – just triumphant boasting about how he was the GOP president who actually delivered on the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nIt’s all about him. It always has been. Trump is a narcissist in a hall of mirrors.\n\nPaul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House.\n\nJill Filipovic: Trump needs women to win in 2024, but he doesn’t seem to care\n\nIf female voters are key to a Donald Trump victory in 2024, the former president should be in big trouble – but he doesn’t seem to care.\n\nAfter being found liable for sexual abuse by a New York jury earlier this week, Trump took to the CNN town hall stage Wednesday night and proceeded to mock and berate Kaitlan Collins, the female anchor questioning him (a “nasty” person, he called her) after mocking and berating E. Jean Carroll, who just bested him in court. And to boot, he boasted about his role in the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, a move that cost many Republicans elections.\n\nA man whose misogyny was so extreme and unvarnished he inspired the Women’s March and the #MeToo movement is back. On Wednesday night, he made clear that he’s as sexist as ever – something that didn’t seem to bother many in the crowd.\n\nThe town hall audience – selected on the basis of their intention to vote in the Republican primary in New Hampshire – appeared to be made up mostly of Trump fans. The crowd generally cheered Trump and his sentiments disparaging whichever woman was in his crosshairs.\n\nThe targeting of Carroll was particularly egregious, considering that a jury just penalized Trump to the tune of $5 million for what they found to be his sexual abuse of Carroll and his defamation of her for calling her claims a “hoax” and a “con job.” At the town hall, he again denied Carroll’s claims, and then turned her into a joke, cruelly laying into her while his fans cheered and jeered.\n\nMany of those fans, of course, were women. There are a significant number of female voters, the overwhelming majority of them White, who are either so accepting of or so used to rank misogyny that they have no issue voting for a man who has boasted about grabbing women’s genitals and whom a jury believes is more likely than not a sexual abuser. And there are, of course, a greater number of men who find Trump’s misogyny excusable enough to cast their ballots in his favor – and even applaud him.\n\nTrump’s attacks on and ridicule of various women in such a short span of time were a harsh reminder of who he is. The question is whether voters in 2024, unlike so many in 2016, will care.\n\nJill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter.\n\nScott Jennings: This is how Trump won in 2016\n\nTrump likely agreed to the CNN town hall to show he’s vigorous enough to handle the rigors of a campaign and ultimately another term in the White House. He surely wants to make a clear comparison to President Joe Biden, who rarely takes questions from the press and frequently struggles with prepared remarks. Polling has shown voters have significant concerns about Biden’s fitness for office, and Trump, should he become the GOP nominee, would benefit if the race was decided on those grounds.\n\nThere’s simply no contest between Trump’s ability to have a quick-paced back-and-forth with a reporter and Biden’s. On Wednesday night, he bullied his way through questions about the 2020 election, the Capitol riot on January 6 and this week’s judgment against him for defaming and sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll.\n\nWhile this may turn off most American voters — particularly critical suburban independents in swing states — it will thrill many Republican primary voters who love to see him bulldoze his way through questions from CNN and other mainstream outlets. The Republican-leaning audience in attendance was clearly pleased with what they heard.\n\nTo analyze this town hall, you have to understand that Trump speaks a language that is understood by his biggest supporters and most GOP primary voters but is not and has never been understood by the media or the Democrats.\n\nIt has never proven to be a language that can attract more voters in a national popular election. But he’s still the master of this language, which he invented back in 2016, and Wednesday’s engagement will be judged a complete success by his campaign as it tries to lock up the 2024 nomination.\n\nScott Jennings, a CNN contributor and Republican campaign adviser, is a former special assistant to President George W. Bush and a former campaign adviser to Sen. Mitch McConnell. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nAshley Allison: Now is the moment to stop Trump\n\nAlert! This is not a test. Donald Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican Party, and on Wednesday night there was an audience of voters applauding for him in New Hampshire.\n\nSpeaking to them, Trump wouldn’t say he regrets January 6. He wouldn’t say which country he wants to win the war – Russia or Ukraine. Trump wouldn’t say he would not sign a national abortion ban. He wouldn’t say he lost the 2020 election. Trump even thought the US should default on its debt.\n\nAmerican voters, say where you stand so the record will reflect it. This means you must be able to assert: There should not be a federal abortion ban. I stand with Ukraine. Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. And January 6 was an insurrection based on lies. If you cannot say these things, you have betrayed your democracy.\n\nTo the majority of Americans who believe these truths, according to a Pew Research survey, say them out loud – proudly and constantly. Commit to put country over politics, democracy over tyranny, justice over abuse.\n\nThis is bigger than any political party. This is bigger than any one candidate. This is the moment to be a patriot and stop Trump from ever again serving as President of the United States.\n\nThat’s it. That is the clarion call. Alert!\n\nAshley Allison is the CEO of Turner Conoly Group. She is a former senior adviser to former President Barack Obama and former senior aide to the Biden-Harris campaign.\n\nFrida Ghitis: If Trump wins, Putin will be happy and Ukraine will suffer\n\nWatching Trump once again disparage American democracy, it’s not particularly surprising to learn that if he became president again, he would not help Ukraine win the war to repel Russia’s brutal aggression and invasion of its territory.\n\n“We’re giving away so much equipment,” he lamented. And when pressed to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war, Trump refused to answer.\n\nHe repeated his claim that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have never started if he were president. The reality is likely quite the opposite.\n\nAs president, Trump delayed sending support that Ukraine was urgently requesting and Congress had already approved – and was impeached. His clashes with allies and the divisions he fomented likely gave Russian President Vladimir Putin the impression that NATO might not stand together to help Ukraine.\n\nIf Trump becomes president before the war is over, there is every chance that he could clog up the pipeline of support from the United States – the world’s leading democracy – for Ukraine, another democracy that is under brutal attack. And there is absolutely no doubt that he would reignite the clashes between the US and its NATO allies, which threatened to unravel an alliance that is now reinvigorated, with a new sense of mission, and a crucial role to play.\n\nTrump had already showed his cards on Ukraine in a recent interview with Fox News, when he told Sean Hannity that “Ultimately, [Putin] is going to take over all of Ukraine.” If Putin does erase Ukraine from the map, there is reason to believe Trump would not find that terribly objectionable.\n\nFrida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review.\n\nAlice Stewart: Trump needs to come up with better answers on abortion\n\nAbortion policy stood out at Trump’s town hall Wednesday night. He managed to tout his pro-life record without boxing himself into a corner on a federal abortion ban. While this is a strategic answer, it could prove to be problematic for Trump.\n\nWhen asked if he would sign a federal abortion ban if reelected, Trump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country.”\n\nTrump is clearly playing to the general election audience.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center, about two-thirds of adults believe abortion should be legal in all cases, while almost a third say it should be illegal. This play to the general election voters could cost him some GOP primary support.\n\nThere’s no question, the pro-life community considers Trump the most consequential president in American history on abortion. Evangelicals rallied in support of Trump for his commitment to appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who made history in overturning Roe v. Wade last year.\n\nThe problem is, Trump’s past performance on protecting the sanctity of life is strong, but his future commitments are about to be put to test in the 2024 GOP primary. Other Republican primary candidates have committed to signing a federal abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. This policy distinction will not go unnoticed.\n\nSusan B. Anthony (SBA) Pro-Life America has indicated they will oppose any presidential candidate who refuses to support at minimum a 15-week national standard on abortion.\n\nAn endorsement from SBA and other pro-life organizations is vital in a Republican primary. A states-only position on abortion is not acceptable for the pro-life movement. Trump may need to come up with a better answer to keep the pro-life community in his good graces.\n\nAlice Stewart is a CNN political commentator and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President.\n\nRaul A. Reyes: Trump’s words about family separation were chilling\n\nIn 2015, candidate Donald Trump came down the escalator in Trump Tower and announced his improbable run for the presidency by referring to immigrants as “rapists” and criminals.\n\nIt seems that not much has changed in the years since – as the now-former president is unrepentant in his anti-immigrant views. In his CNN town hall on Wednesday, Trump claimed “people” were “coming in” after being released from prisons and mental institutions.\n\nThere is, in fact, no evidence that migrants are coming to the border from mental institutions or prisons. The former president also doubled down on his horrific (and unpopular) family separation policy at the border and reiterated his false claim that he built “hundreds of miles” of the border wall.\n\nTrump’s language regarding immigrants was not only divisive, it was – and is – dangerous. It seems that he has learned nothing about the power of his words to drive anti-Latino violence, like the mass shooting in El Paso in 2019. And any possibility of a return to the family separation policy, which was truly a dark time in US history, is absolutely chilling.\n\nSadly, based on applause, Trump’s ugly rhetoric seemed popular with his not-so-diverse audience at Saint Anselm College. Yet New Hampshire is hardly representative of the US overall, and Trump said nothing tonight that might win over new voters.\n\nKaitlan Collins fact-checked Trump vigorously, but this town hall often felt like a Trump rally. On immigration, as well as myriad other issues, Trump was entirely predictable and misleading. We have all seen this act before, and it’s really, really tired. If Trump’s campaign was hoping to gain any new supporters or showcase a new image for the former president, this evening represented a resounding failure to launch.\n\nRaul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes.\n\nSE Cupp: This was a brutal reminder that Trump isn’t defeated\n\nI’ll be honest, I’m fairly dejected after watching Wednesday night’s Trump town hall in New Hampshire.\n\nOur job, as journalists, is to hold powerful people accountable and ask them tough questions. Our intrepid anchor Kaitlan Collins did just that. However, the premise is that the person in power on the receiving end of those questions will answer them. What Trump did was hijack a town hall to do what he always does – distract, deflect, lie, insult his opponents, insult his questioner and play to his base, who loves it all.\n\nWatching Trump do this for over an hour, as a clearly packed crowd of his supporters applauded and laughed at his lies and smears, was a brutal reminder that Trump is not defeated, he is not chastened nor is he irrelevant. It was also a warning that these kinds of events, however well-intentioned, are not in the best service of democracy, transparency, accountability or any of the other things good journalism efforts at.\n\nSE Cupp is a CNN political commentator.\n\nMondaire Jones: America is in greater danger than we thought\n\nThe audience reactions during CNN’s presidential town hall with Trump show that America is in greater danger than perhaps many of us thought.\n\nThe assembly of Republican and “undeclared” voters at St. Anselm College in the critical early primary state of New Hampshire stood behind Trump, raucously applauding the former president throughout the night despite the stream of falsehoods he uttered — including lies about the 2020 election being stolen.\n\nThey applauded when he said he would consider pardoning “a large portion” of the January 6 insurrectionists, whose violence he greatly downplayed. They also laughed when he mocked E. Jean Carroll, who won a civil lawsuit against him on Tuesday, with a federal jury finding Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming her.\n\nThese reactions show how entrenched Trumpism is within the Republican Party. The audience members who applauded Trump’s lies and immoral behavior on stage represent a Republican electorate that largely rejects widely disseminated, clear evidence contradicting what it wants to believe or — worse — knows is the truth and doesn’t care.\n\nMondaire Jones is a CNN political commentator and former Representative for New York’s 17th Congressional District. He also serves as a member of the US Commission on Civil Rights.\n\nGeoff Duncan: Trump is stuck in 2020, and so far the GOP is too\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took the stage at Saint Anselm College as the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination, but it’s clear that his mindset is still stuck in 2020.\n\nFrom accusing former Vice President Mike Pence of doing something “wrong” on January 6 to defending his “perfect” call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a defiant Trump dug in on the election denialism that has come to define his presidency. He refused to back down from the disproven claims that there was widespread election fraud in 2020, and even labeled January 6 a “beautiful day.”\n\nOn the major policy issues of the day – immigration, federal debt, abortion – he offered little, if anything, in the way of specifics. He barely took the time to remind voters about the rightful accomplishments of his presidency, like the significant tax cuts that were enacted in 2017.\n\nThe town hall comes at a perilous time for Biden, after a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll showed the president’s approval ratings sinking into the mid 30s amid growing doubts about his fitness for office. But Trump squandered the opportunity to exploit Biden’s weaknesses, and instead of using the primetime appearance to appeal to swing voters in the suburbs, he played the base’s greatest hits.\n\nStill, Trump’s charisma and showmanship were undeniable. The crowd roared with applause at multiple moments. Thus far, it’s undeniable that Trump is the leader of the GOP pack.\n\nIf Republicans fall for his snake oil again, we have no one but ourselves to blame if we lose another election.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/09/trump-arizona-kari-lake-blake-masters-election-rally/8209439001/', 'Headline': 'Trump in Arizona: Recap from Kari Lake, Blake Masters rally in Mesa', 'Snippet': ""The event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November's election.

The event was streamed on YouTube.\n\nFind related stories:\n\nRally: After a scorching Sunday in Mesa, here are 3 Trump rally takeaways\n\nRepublican candidates rally with Trump: Will it help — or hurt — with voters?\n\nRepublicans for Hobbs: Katie Hobbs gets GOP backing as Trump rallies followers in Mesa\n\nStylistic, policy differences: Kari Lake, Hobbs make back-to-back appearances on national TV\n\nDonald Trump\'s visits to Arizona: Here\'s a list of all 17 times Trump has come to Arizona during his political career\n\nMore coverage by Republic reporters of Trump and the Republican campaign rally in Mesa follows below.\n\n6:55 p.m.: Trump fails to mention 2 Arizona Republicans\n\nFormer President Donald Trump wrapped up his Arizona remarks with endorsements for most, but not all, of the state’s Republican congressional candidates.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump shared the dais with gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters in an effort to boost the top of the ticket.\n\nHe also took turns praising U.S. Reps. Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar and Debbie Lesko, as well as GOP challengers Eli Crane and Kelly Cooper. Trump notably didn’t mention Rep. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani, who is the GOP nominee in a Tucson-area district.\n\nAfter doing so, Trump again turned to the dark imagery of an America in chaos because of Democratic policies. He complained of inflation and declining stocks, dead U.S. soldiers and wasted hardware in Afghanistan and with Ukraine at war.\n\n“We are a nation in decline,” Trump said near the end of his speech as sorrowful sounding music played. “We are a nation that in many ways has become a joke.”\n\n“But we are not going to allow this horror to continue,” he said. “It is hard-working patriots like you who are going to save this country.”\n\nBy the time Trump was ending his speech, many in the crowd already had walked away.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n6:40 p.m.: Trump ends speech in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has concluded his remarks at a rally in Mesa. Trump spoke for more than 90 minutes, airing many of the grievances he has repeated for years, while also giving attention to Republican candidates that he is backing in the state.\n\n6:10 p.m.: Trump says World War III could happen soon\n\nThe planet could be on the verge of World War III, former President Donald Trump said Sunday, blaming the Biden administration for failing to avert the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the spiraling tensions over it.\n\nWith characteristic self-congratulation, Trump praised himself for being correct about “everything” but said he hopes he is wrong that another global war could be on the horizon.\n\n“We must demand immediate negotiation of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine or we will end up in World War III, and there will never be a war like this. We will never have had a war like this, and that’s all because of stupid people that don’t have a clue. And it’s also because of the kind of weaponry that’s available today.”\n\nTrump castigated Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as a reliable vote for ill-considered legislation pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nMore than 45 minutes into his remarks, Trump returned repeatedly to claims of a stolen election in 2020. He called 2020 a “rigged and stolen election.”\n\n“I ran twice. I won twice,” Trump said.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen and Alison Steinbach\n\n5:55 p.m.: Trump claims predecessors took classified records\n\nFormer President Donald Trump unloaded on the FBI and accused his presidential predecessors over the criminal investigation of the documents seized from his residence at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe alluded to a third presidential run that won’t get derailed by what he views as politically motivated attacks on him.\n\n“What they’re trying to do is take us out so we can’t represent you if we decide to do that, but we’ll be making a decision very soon,” he said to rising cheers.\n\nTrump claimed that former President Bill Clinton took millions of classified records with him when he left office, and presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama also improperly took records as well.\n\nClinton lost the nuclear codes and former President Jimmy Carter sent the nuclear codes to a dry cleaner, Trump said, adding that nothing happened in those matters.\n\n“Lock her up! Lock her up!” the crowd chanted after Trump mentioned former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton kept private from officials government emails.\n\n“They should give me back everything that was taken,” Trump said of the records taken by the FBI.\n\n“They plant documents,” he said of the FBI. Trump wondered aloud when the Clintons would face investigation and prosecution.\n\n“I don’t think they will do it, and I don’t think they should do it,” Trump said.\n\nDespite his complaints, Trump said the actions against him drove his poll numbers higher.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5:30 p.m.: Trump starts speech with familiar topics\n\nFormer President Donald Trump wasted no time on Sunday launching into familiar grievances and a bleak image of America without him in the White House.\n\nCiting the influx of illegal immigrants, soaring prices and arrests of people who oppose abortion, Trump hit President Joe Biden and Democrats generally for a country in turmoil.\n\n“These are incredible people. They’re being treated like terrorists,” Trump said, vaguely alluding to those who support him or conservative causes.\n\n“Nothing happens to antifa. Nothing happens to (Black Lives Matter). But look at what happens to patriots. The Democrats are locking up their political opponents,"" he said.\n\nTrump put himself and his many controversies as the central evidence of Democrats abusing their power to hurt Republican opponents.\n\nHe complained of impeachment over what he again referred to a “perfect phone call” where he tied approval of military aid to Ukraine to that country declaring an investigation of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHe described his conversation with Georgia election officials that is under criminal investigation “an absolutely perfect phone call.”\n\nWithin seconds of taking the stage, Trump had complained about the media, alluded to his baseless claims of a stolen election and hinted that more elections could lie ahead.\n\n“We won it big and we won it a second time,” Trump said early on.\n\nHe took the stage in sun-splashed Mesa an hour later than scheduled, though those in the crowd of perhaps 5,000 at the event had stuck around without any obvious complaints.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5 p.m.: Trump takes the stage in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump started speaking to the crowd in Mesa just before 5 p.m. Sunday, about an hour later than scheduled. He started his remarks by repeating his false claim that he won Arizona in 2020 and went on the attack against Democrats.\n\n4:50 p.m.: Lake fires up crowd, but doesn\'t mention 2020 election\n\nRepublican candidate for Arizona governor Kari Lake, the former television news anchor, spoke for 18 minutes on Sunday — without once mentioning the 2020 election and the false claims about it that propelled her to political prominence.\n\nInstead, Lake painted her Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs as an absent candidate who refused to debate her, while Lake has toured the state speaking directly to voters. She connected Hobbs to the Biden administration, claiming Hobbs would raise taxes on Arizonans already feeling the brunt of record-high inflation. Hobbs has said she does not plan to do so, and either candidate would need the Legislature’s agreement to change tax policy.\n\nLake repeatedly noted a discrimination case Hobbs was involved in while Hobbs was the Democratic leader in the state Senate. A Black female Democratic staffer proved to two juries she was discriminated against and fired in retaliation by Hobbs and others after raising an issue over her pay disparity.\n\nThose verdicts, Lake said, showed Hobbs had already embarrassed the state and should not lead it. Her attacks prompted cheers from the crowd.\n\n“They’re saying lock her up,” Lake said. “I think we should just vote her out, how’s that?”\n\nLake proved victorious in August’s four-way primary election with the backing of Trump, who remains polarizing in politics. And though claims about the 2020 election being stolen or corrupt are a hallmark of her campaign — she has said she wouldn’t have certified Biden’s win in the state two years ago — she didn’t mention them Sunday.\n\nInstead, she pledged a crackdown at the border to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking and talked about economic hardship facing Arizonans. In a new policy proposal, Lake said she would work to prohibit municipalities from collecting taxes on groceries and rent. Doing both would require the Legislature to pass a bill.\n\n“It is said hard times create strong men, well they create strong women too,” she said. “And this woman is ready to put an end to the hard times. Who is ready to step up with me?”\n\nThe crowd chanted back: “Kari! Kari! Kari!”\n\n4 p.m.: Finchem promises changes to voting if elected secretary of state\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem’s walk-on music at the Mesa rally was the theme from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" To further his Western bona fides, and to take a swipe at East Coast commentators who mock his western vibe, Finchem wore his cowboy hat and sported his “Sunday Go-To Meeting Tie.“\n\nHe launched into his familiar attack on his Democratic opponent for secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, from Fontes’ missteps during the 2020 Democratic presidential preference election to his support of all-mail voting to policy changes that were slapped down by court rulings.\n\n“Just follow the law” is his campaign mantra, and he said he will stick to the rules.\n\nAs secretary of state, Finchem said he will push for post-election audits in all 15 counties and disconnect Arizona from ERIC, the Electronic Registration Information Center, which shares voter information among states to ensure there is not double voting.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n3:40 p.m.: Masters continues to pound Kelly over border, drugs, crime\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued his aggressive attacks on Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., saying he should have to attend the funerals of overdose victims killed by drugs that entered America from its porous borders.\n\nMasters rattled off a familiar list of complaints about current conditions: There are 300,000 people crossing the nation’s border each month, violent crime has soared in Phoenix since 2019 and fentanyl continues to kill Americans everywhere.\n\n“Mark Kelly has been radio silent about fentanyl for 22 months,” Masters said. That ended last week, Masters said, because he had a debate with Masters.\n\n“One month before Election Day, he says, ‘Uh oh. I better pretend to start doing something about fentanyl,’” Masters said, adding that 2,000 Arizonans have died from the drug in the past year.\n\n“I think Mark Kelly should have to attend the funerals. Let him look a grieving mother in the eye and he can explain to her why he failed to even lift a finger to secure our border,” Masters said.\n\nHis words extend attacks on Kelly that shot to prominence last week during the debate between the Senate candidates.\n\nMasters took the stage to “Danger Zone,” the song made famous in both installments of the movie “Top Gun” that is about Navy pilots. It would seem a curious choice. Kelly was a Navy fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut, while Masters never served in the military.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n3 p.m.: Hamadeh, Lesko describe a country in turmoil\n\nAbe Hamadeh, a Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona attorney general, characterized Arizona as on the front lines of defending America in a short speech at the rally in Mesa.\n\n“Arizona, we shocked the hell out of the establishment on Aug. 2, and are you ready to do it again?” Hamadeh said to loud applause.\n\nHamadeh said Democrats have harmed the country in the past couple years, citing inflation, drugs and “terrorists” crossing the border with Mexico, critical race theory in schools, censorship from big tech and Democrats who are “weaponizing the law and targeting patriots.”\n\n“Arizona is on the front lines of so many of the battles facing our country, and if we lose Arizona, we lose our country, but we’re not going to lose. We’re not going to lose because President Trump is still fighting for America,” he said.\n\nAs attorney general, Hamadeh said he would fight criminals, drug cartels and the federal government and “lock up some people and put handcuffs on them,” prompting cheers in the crowd of “lock them up.”\n\n“America has been down before, but America has never been out. The rest of the country is watching, they’re watching what we do right here in Arizona, because if we win, there’s still hope for America. And when we win, when we win, Arizona will lead America’s greatest comeback and never look back,"" he said.\n\nThe dark imagery was a theme among speakers.\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., described a dystopian America on the verge of collapse in the hands of Democrats in her remarks Sunday.\n\nInflation, a “totally open border,” fentanyl and violent crime have surged under President Joe Biden with help from congressional Democrats, Lesko told the crowd in Mesa.\n\nAnd authorities have hounded Trump since he began his political career, she said.\n\n“They continue to go after President Trump for six years,” she said, also lamenting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “to take away our rights” presumably during the pandemic.\n\n“If our country is going to survive, this has got to stop,” Lesko said.\n\n— Alison Steinbach and Ronald J. Hansen\n\n2:40 p.m.: Republicans rally with Katie Hobbs in Paradise Valley\n\nDemocratic candidate for governor Katie Hobbs held a brief news conference Sunday morning at Barry Goldwater Memorial Park in Paradise Valley to emphasize that Republicans should support her over rival Kari Lake.\n\nSeveral members of Hobbs’ “Republicans for Katie Hobbs Coalition” gathered with her at the park, which celebrates the state’s conservative icon who died in 1998 following five terms as a U.S. senator.\n\nKarie Dozer, a former spokesman for the late state Attorney General Grant Woods, said Goldwater would be “shaking his head in disgust” at how “crazy” Republican politics have become.\n\nKari Lake is “dangerous for Arizona,” said Mesa Mayor John Giles, and that’s why he — a Republican — was at the park with Hobbs and not at Trump’s rally in Mesa on Sunday.\n\n“Those of us who support Secretary Hobbs care very deeply about the future of Arizona,” he said. “And that’s why we are putting our state above our party.”\n\nNovember’s election wasn’t between Republicans and Democrats, but “a choice between sanity and chaos,” he added.\n\nMonica Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, describing herself as a former Republican, emphasized that the nation has “moved forward” under Biden.\n\nShe didn’t leave the party, she said — it left her when it began running “candidates operating from places of hatred, hubris and hostility rather than honesty, humility and humanity.”\n\nHobbs, repeating Giles’ statement about “sanity” and “chaos,” said the problem isn’t just that Lake “proudly accepts support from Nazis and spews dang conspiracy theories, it’s what she would actually do as governor.”\n\nHobbs then ran down a litany of Lake’s positions, including her support for a territorial-era anti-abortion law, baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, and surveillance cameras in public-school classrooms.\n\nLake’s entire platform “boils down into being a sore loser,” she said.\n\nOther Republicans at the event included former Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana and former state legislator Steve May.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n2 p.m.: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appears at rally\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., echoed the language of the Great Replacement theory popular with white nationalists in her message to Arizonans in Mesa on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking about illegal immigration, Greene said 5 million people have crossed the Mexican border with impunity from a derelict President Joe Biden.\n\n“Five million people from all over the world have crossed our borders,” Greene said. “Joe Biden’s 5 million illegal aliens are on the verge of replacing you, replacing your jobs, replacing your kids in school, and coming from all over the world they are also replacing your culture. That’s not great for America.”\n\nThe replacement theory is an idea first popular among white nationalists that Democrats want illegal immigrants to keep their party politically viable.\n\nSome Republicans have flirted with similar rhetoric to energize their base, which has long seen the border as dangerously porous.\n\nGreene has long pushed a nationalist message. Last year, Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., were briefly linked to creating an America First Caucus that was reportedly linked to preserving the nation’s Anglo-Saxon past and dramatically restricting the nation’s immigration laws. Both lawmakers quickly distanced themselves from the caucus idea after bipartisan pushback.\n\nBefore taking the stage, Greene predicted the shifting state of Arizona’s law on abortion rights would not play a significant role in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe state’s guiding law seems to have whipsawed between a Civil War-era law that bans nearly all abortions and a law passed earlier this year that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDespite the conflicting rulings and the attention it brings back to the issue, Greene said it won’t have an impact on voting in Arizona.\n\n“I don’t think it’s distracting at all,” she told a reporter before taking the stage in Mesa. Instead, America-first themes, like those identified by Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters, will resonate with voters, she said.\n\nGreene said she is looking forward to Republicans winning back the House of Representatives after the November elections. When that happens, she said, she will be placed on the House Oversight Committee, where she plans to open investigations into Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s embattled son.\n\nGreene also said Big Tech will face scrutiny over its “collusion” with Democrats in 2020 to censor conservative voices.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n1:45 p.m.: Trump, Lake supporters travel from Arizona, out of state\n\nAs the prayer, pledge of allegiance and national anthem began shortly before 1:30 p.m., attendees were still streaming into the dirt lot at Bell Bank Park. Seats were filled in the relatively small area of floor seating and risers around the speaking platform.\n\nAfter the national anthem, a chant of “USA, USA, USA” rose through the crowd. Many wore Trump attire, some wore anti-Biden clothes, and lots wore red, white and blue apparel, including a few people draped in American or Arizona flags.\n\nA few people were carried out on stretchers; it was a hot and sunny afternoon.\n\n“We’re just real Trump people,” said Ann-Marie Villicana, who drove from Pasadena, California, on Saturday to see Trump on Sunday.\n\nVillicana said she founded LA Trump and was a delegate from California in 2016. One of her friends is working with Lake so she came out to show support.\n\n“Since we haven’t been able to get out to Arizona to help Kari Lake, we thought the least we could do was donate money, get great seats,” she said. She and Robin Salzer had VIP seats.\n\n“People are just fed up and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” Salzer said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Schafer of Chandler voted for Trump and is a big supporter but said she hadn’t gone to one of his events until Sunday.\n\n“I am brokenhearted that America is in the condition it’s in,” she said, adding that she’s concerned about issues like inflation, the 2nd Amendment and school curriculum.\n\nSchaefer was excited to hear from Trump and Lake in particular. “I’m 100% Trumpster, I’m 100% Kari Lake,” she said, wearing a Trump shirt and hat. She said the midterm election will be “honest” because so many more people are paying attention.\n\nMaria Foshay traveled from Rancho Cucamonga, California, to hear Trump speak. She hopes he’ll announce his next move during the speech, ideally that he’ll run for president again in 2024. Foshay wants to make sure the election is truthful, fair and with “no cheating.”\n\nKerry Josey of Mesa said Trump is “the face of the people,” adding that she’s been to three of his rallies. She’s concerned about whether the upcoming election will be truthful.\n\nKathy Elgin stood out in the sea of red-colored couture with her eye-catching Oregon Women for Trump-shirt. She and four friends flew in from Oregon for a quick turnaround trip solely for Trump.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” Elgin said.\n\nA resident of Salem, Elgin said Oregon was a red state “until we got mail-in voting.” Since then, she said, the state has turned blue and she doesn’t buy it.\n\nAn avid Trump follower, Elgin said she got a visit from FBI after returning from the Jan. 6 rally at the U.S. Capitol. She called the visit “audacious” explaining that she never witnessed any violence at the Capitol until she saw television footing.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, Eryka Forquer and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n12 p.m.: Who is scheduled to speak at Trump rally in Mesa\n\nThe speaker list for Sunday\'s rally includes names familiar to Arizonans, as well as some of the more outspoken Trump advocates, including U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nTwo members of Arizona\'s congressional delegation are on board to address the rally: Republican representatives Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko.\n\nThey will join former Trump administration staffers Rich Grenell and Kash Patel, who were with Trump at a similar rally in Nevada on Saturday.\n\nGrenell served briefly as acting director of National Intelligence in 2020, while also holding the posts of U.S. ambassador to Germany and special presidential envoy for the Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations.\n\nPatel was former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nThe event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November\'s election. Arizona candidates slated to speak are gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. U.S. Senate nominee Blake Masters, secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem and attorney general nominee Abe Hamedeh.\n\nThe speeches are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n11 a.m.: Masters: \'This race is winnable\'\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued what amounted to a victory lap ahead of his rally with former President Donald Trump in Mesa later today.\n\nMasters appeared with Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" on Fox News and made the case that his showing in Thursday\'s debate with Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., had reversed the race.\n\n""I expected him to struggle to defend (his record in the Senate) and he did,"" Masters said of Kelly. ""All I had to do, Maria, was go out there and tell the truth. Explain to the people how Mark Kelly has kept our border wide open, how his votes for all the crazy trillions of dollars in spending have caused inflation.""\n\n""I think we had him on the ropes a little bit, and it\'s a huge vibe shift, a momentum shift for our campaign,"" he continued.\n\nAsked about the lack of financial investment from some conservative corners, Masters predicted, ""a lot more people are going to get involved.""\n\n""I think I showed people that this race is winnable, that I\'m a much, much better candidate than Sen. Kelly in that debate the other night.""\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n10 a.m.: Lake and Hobbs on national TV prior to Trump rally\n\nArizona’s candidates for governor appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation morning news show Sunday, just hours ahead of Trump’s visit to the state.\n\nThe former president wasn’t the focus of the discussion; instead, Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs and Republican nominee Kari Lake discussed their plans for border security, abortion and other issues, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nThe interviews, conducted separately and aired back to back, might be the closest equivalent to a debate a national audience will see this cycle. They highlighted the stylistic and policy differences of two women locked in a nationally watched race that most polls say is tied.\n\nLake has shifted from praising a near-total ban on abortion to saying she will follow the law. She did so again Sunday. Arizona has two conflicting laws on the books, but a court ruling Friday has allowed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks except for in medical emergencies to prevail.\n\nLake told CBS news correspondent Major Garrett the “law right now as it stands is Gov. Ducey\'s law at 15 weeks, so we\'ll follow the law,” according to a transcript of the interview.\n\nGarrett likewise tried to pin down Hobbs’ position on abortion, which Lake has painted as extreme because Hobbs has repeatedly declined to say if there is a stage of pregnancy after which she thinks abortion should be prohibited. Pressed on that, Garrett asked Hobbs if an Arizona voter would be right to conclude that she does “not favor any specific week limit on abortion.”\n\n“I support leaving the decision between a woman and her doctor and leaving politicians entirely out of it,” Hobbs replied.\n\nLake spent much of her interview talking about her plan to use state law enforcement as border patrol and deportation officers, an authority she’d seek using an untested legal theory that would buck decades of court precedent and likely lead to a lawsuit.\n\n“I hope that Joe Biden doesn\'t fight us because then it would really look like he is on the side of the cartel,” she said.\n\nLake didn’t mention Trump in her interview, perhaps a reflection of his unpopularity with voters nationally. Hobbs brought up the former president twice, attacking his record at the southern border and his false claims the 2020 election was “stolen,” which Lake has parroted.\n\nHobbs said Trump’s effort to build the border wall, the signature of his border policy, wasn’t finished and called on the Biden administration to “step up.”\n\nAsked why she wouldn’t debate Lake, and if her decision not to participate shortchanged voters of a chance to see how Hobbs would respond in a moment of duress, Hobbs shifted to Trump.\n\n“I think the voters of Arizona have had a chance to see how I work under crisis throughout my leadership during the 2020 election as secretary of state,” Hobbs said, “when we had to combat multiple election challenges from former President Trump and his band of election deniers, including my opponent Kari Lake.""\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n9 a.m.: 17 visits and counting\n\nArizona\'s political preeminence seems like a given these days, but the red state-turned-purple battleground coincides almost perfectly with the political rise of Donald Trump.\n\nThe former president found early enthusiasm for his America-first message in Arizona in 2015, and he never really stopped coming back.\n\nHis scheduled rally in Mesa will add to an Arizona total no president or presidential contender can rival, with big asterisks for Barry Goldwater and John McCain, who lived in the state while pursuing the White House.\n\nAccording to Republic research, Trump has made at least 17 visits since entering politics.\n\nThat is a list that began on July 11, 2015, with a stop in Phoenix that focused on immigration and helped set the tone for his upstart campaign.\n\nBy the end of the 2016 campaign, Trump made six more stops in Arizona. He carried the state by 3.5 percentage points, an unusually low margin in a state that had voted Republican in all but one presidential election beginning in 1952.\n\nTrump visited the state seven times in 2020. That included a Feb. 19, 2020, rally in Phoenix just weeks before the pandemic halted campaign visits for months.\n\nIn May 2020, Trump started to move about again, with a stop at a Phoenix Honeywell facility making respirator masks to cope with the health crisis and to discuss aid to Native Americans.\n\nHe wound up losing Arizona in 2020 by fewer than 11,000 votes, the smallest margin in the country.\n\nTrump made his first post-presidential visit to Arizona on July 24, 2021, at a Turning Point Action rally in Phoenix in which he saw firsthand the raucous reception to Kari Lake by Republicans.\n\nHe wrongly predicted the ongoing review of Maricopa County ballots would vindicate his baseless claims of a stolen election.\n\nThis year, Trump held a January rally in Florence, a pre-primary rally in Prescott Valley in July and is set now to again back his slate of Republicans on Sunday in Mesa.\n\n— Ronald J.

Then, she said, things went off the rails.\n\nLake compared her rival, Democrat Katie Hobbs, to Biden for her lack of visibility on the campaign trail, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nWhile Biden spent some of the 2020 campaign working from his basement because of COVID-19 concerns, Hobbs is equally underground, Lake suggested. “I call her ‘Basement Hobbs,’” she said.\n\nThe real attraction was Trump\n\nThe crowd at Bell Bank Park in Mesa had staying power.\n\nAs temperatures climbed to 88 degrees under an intense sun, the crowd showed few signs of thinning as people waited for Trump to arrive on stage. Packed, standing shoulder to shoulder, they waited nearly two hours after Lake had finished her speech. In the meantime, they were entertained by a soundtrack that ranged from ""Phantom of the Opera"" to Elvis to Hot Tramp.\n\nFor many of the thousands who attended Sunday, the draw was Trump more so than the Arizona candidates.\n\nAnn-Marie Villicana drove to the southeast Valley from Pasadena, Calif., with Robin Salzer on Saturday. A founder of LA Trump, a group that supports the former president, Villicana said she wanted to add to the enthusiasm for a strong Republican turnout in the midterms and particularly for Kari Lake.\n\nSalzer said he thinks frustration is bringing people out to events like this.\n\n“People are just fed up, and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” he said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Elgin and four friends flew in from Oregon, sporting their red and white Oregon Women for Trump T-shirts.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” she said.\n\nGet ready for lines at the polls Nov. 8\n\nAn informal survey of attendees as they waited for Trump’s arrival showed elections officials should prepare for lines at the polls.\n\nPerson after person leaning against the metal gates that hemmed in the crowd said they would vote at the polls on Nov. 8 because they don’t trust mail-in voting.\n\n“I like to see it go in,” one man said of watching his ballot get fed into the tabulation machine.\n\nTheir attitudes reflect increased skepticism about the reliability of early voting, or vote by mail, that has grown since the 2020 election.\n\nTrump alluded to that distrust in his talk.\n\n“Sometimes the mail-in ballots are just not as good as being out there on Nov. 8,” he said.\n\n“If you can, vote in person on election day,” Trump said. “Because it’s a lot harder for them to cheat.” He did not clarify who he was referring to.\n\nTrump said those who vote by mail risk getting a “potentially fake ballot.”\n\nThere is no evidence of that ever occurring in Arizona.\n\nIn the August primary, Republican voters showed an uptick in voting at the polls, although voting by mail remained by far the most popular form of voting, used by 85% of voters in Maricopa County.\n\nRepublic reporter Alison Steinbach contributed to this article.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2023/05/factchecking-trumps-cnn-town-hall/', 'Headline': ""FactChecking Trump's CNN Town Hall - FactCheck.org"", 'Snippet': 'Posted on May 11, 2023.

Among them: He claimed ...', 'Full_text': 'Former President Donald Trump’s town hall event felt like a lightning round of false and misleading claims — most of which we’ve heard before. Among them:\n\nHe claimed the conservative group True the Vote found Democrats “stuffing ballot boxes” with “millions of votes” and it was caught “on government cameras.” It did not.\n\nTrump falsely claimed that he “didn’t ask” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger “to find” him more votes. In a Jan. 2, 2021, call, Trump told Raffensperger: “I just want to find 11,780 votes,” which was one more than Trump needed to win the state.\n\nThen-Vice President Mike Pence didn’t have the legal right to send electoral votes back to the states, contrary to Trump’s claim that Pence “did something wrong” by not rejecting the votes in states he lost.\n\nTrump falsely claimed that “we have open borders,” when each month border officials have apprehended and expelled tens of thousands of people who illegally enter the country.\n\nHe made an unsubstantiated claim that many of the immigrants coming illegally across the southern border are people released from prisons and mental institutions.\n\nThe former president wrongly claimed that the Presidential Records Act allowed him to negotiate the return of presidential materials to the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nPresident Joe Biden donated 1,850 boxes of records from his Senate years to the University of Delaware. There’s no evidence they contain classified information or that Biden refused to give them “back,” as Trump said.\n\nTrump claimed that “we were energy independent” during his administration, but the U.S. never attained 100% self-sufficiency and still relied on energy imports under Trump.\n\nHe wrongly claimed that U.S. gasoline prices reached $9 under Biden. The highest weekly average price under Biden was about $5 in June 2022.\n\nTrump claimed that under Roe v. Wade, “They could kill the baby … after the baby was born.” The court opinion allowed states to prohibit abortion after fetal viability, with exceptions for the mother’s life and health.\n\nTrump — the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican nomination, despite a criminal indictment in New York and an ongoing criminal investigation in Georgia — took questions from New Hampshire Republicans and undeclared voters in the May 10 prime time event moderated by CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins.\n\nFalse Claims of Vote Fraud\n\nStill refusing to accept the results of an election he lost, Trump made numerous false claims about how the 2020 presidential election was “rigged.” For example, Trump claimed, “If you look at True the Vote, they found millions of votes on camera, on government cameras, where [Democrats] were stuffing ballot boxes.”\n\nTrump is referring to the “2000 Mules” documentary by conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, which purported to provide evidence that thousands of so-called “mules” were employed to illegally stuff ballot drop boxes with fraudulent ballots. The film was based on research from the conservative group True the Vote, which used geotracking data of cellphones and noted people who were near numerous ballot drop boxes and liberal nonprofits. We reviewed the film’s claims and found the evidence lacking.\n\nWhen Georgia investigators looked into a handful of videos showing people depositing multiple ballots, it turned out to be people legally dropping off ballots for eligible voters in their immediate family. The House Jan. 6 committee released video of an interview of former Attorney General Bill Barr, who offered a blistering assessment, calling the cellphone data “singularly unimpressive” and saying the film simply “didn’t establish widespread illegal harvesting.”\n\nCall to Georgia Secretary of State\n\nToward the end of the town hall, Collins revisited the topic of Trump’s baseless voter fraud claims.\n\nCollins asked Trump about his Jan. 2, 2021, phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — which has become the focus of a criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney’s office into whether Trump tried to illegally overturn the state’s 2020 presidential election outcome.\n\nAsked if he would still make that call today, knowing that it would lead to a criminal investigation, Trump said there was nothing wrong with the call and that he was merely “questioning the election.”\n\nCollins: You asked him to find you votes.\n\nTrump: I didn’t ask him to find anything.\n\nThat’s false. Trump asked Raffensperger to find him enough votes so that he could win the state — after Joe Biden had already been certified and recertified as the winner in Georgia.\n\n“I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state,” Trump told Raffensperger on the call.\n\nSpecifically, Trump told Raffensperger to look in Cobb and Fulton counties — which were both won by Biden. “You will find you will be at 11,779 within minutes because Fulton County is totally corrupt,” Trump said on the call.\n\nPence Didn’t Have Right to Reject Electoral Votes\n\nTrump was asked if he owed his vice president, Mike Pence, an apology over what happened during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and Trump’s repeated attempts to push Pence to refuse to count electoral votes.\n\n“No, because he did something wrong,” Trump said. “He should have sent the votes back to the state legislatures and I think we would have had a different outcome.”\n\nA constitutional expert told us Pence did not have the legal right to change or reject the electoral votes. The Electoral Count Act, which was signed into law in 1887, says the vice president is simply supposed to hand the tellers the state certifications after he opens them, and the tellers are then to read those documents and make a list of the votes.\n\nAccording to the Jan. 6 committee report, Pence and his counsel Greg Jacob and others told Trump that Pence did not have the authority to send those electoral votes back to the states. Even Trump’s lawyer John Eastman “admitted” that Trump had been advised that the vice president did not have the unilateral power to refuse to count votes under the Electoral College Act, but Trump “continued to pressure the Vice President to act illegally,” the report said.\n\nTrump said Pence and others were wrong, and that the proof is that “right after the election they all met – the RINOs [Republicans in name only] and the Democrats – and they worked out a plan to make sure that future vice presidents don’t do what I said you could do.” Congress revised the Electoral Count Act in December 2022, but only to “reaffirm” that a vice president’s role in the electoral vote counting process is “ministerial.” It was not an admission that the law previously allowed a vice president to take the steps Trump sought.\n\nIllegal Immigration\n\nThe U.S. does not “have open borders,” as Trump falsely claimed. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, particularly Border Patrol agents, have continued to apprehend and expel tens of thousands of people who illegally cross the southern border each month, according to the most recent CBP data.\n\nIn the Southwest Border Enforcement Report for fiscal year 2021, which was published in August 2022, the Office of Immigration Statistics said preliminary estimates indicated that the model-based apprehension rate in FY 2021 was about the same as the 78% average from FY 2018 to FY 2020, which were the three fiscal years when Trump was president the whole time. In its August 2020 Border Security Metrics Report, the Department of Homeland Security explained that the model-based apprehension rate is “the estimated share of all attempted unlawful border crossers between land [ports of entries] that is apprehended.”\n\nNo Evidence for Prisons Claim\n\nAs he has numerous times in recent months, Trump made the unsubstantiated claim that many of the immigrants coming illegally across the southern border are people released from prisons and mental institutions.\n\n“Look what is happening at our southern border,” Trump said. “Millions and millions of people are coming in. They’re being released from prisons. They’re being released from mental institutions.”\n\nWe wrote about this claim in March when Trump said at a rally in Texas, “Other countries are emptying out their prisons, insane asylums and mental institutions and sending their most heinous criminals to the United States.” When making the claim, Trump has sometimes cited a news story he says he read, about a doctor at a mental institution in South America who said he no longer has people to take care of because all the patients are being sent to the U.S. We could not find any such story, and immigration experts we talked to said there’s simply no evidence that is happening.\n\n“I cannot prove this is false, but I follow migration in Latin America and the Caribbean quite closely and have never ever heard anything like this related to current migration from the region,” Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, told us. “I have never heard any credible claims that any country has been emptying its prisons or mental hospitals so that those released can migrate to the United States.”\n\nPresidential Records Act\n\nThe former president wrongly claimed that the Presidential Records Act allowed him to negotiate with the National Archives and Records Administration for the return of presidential materials he took with him after leaving office. A president can keep personal materials, but not presidential documents.\n\nThe Presidential Records Act says that after a president’s term, the archivist “shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.”\n\nTrump claimed, “We were negotiating with them as per, as per the Presidential Records Act,” adding that “all of the sudden, they raided the house.”\n\n“They didn’t raid the house of Joe Biden,” Trump also said. CNN’s Collins correctly noted: “Joe Biden didn’t ignore a subpoena to get those documents back like you did.”\n\nAs we’ve written, Trump took eight months to comply with NARA’s requests for the return of presidential documents he had at his Mar-a-Lago home. NARA then discovered classified documents among those records. In responding to a subpoena for more classified material, Trump’s lawyers handed over an envelope with 38 classified documents.\n\nTwo months after that, the FBI obtained a court-approved search warrant for Mar-a-Lago and retrieved 13 boxes that contained “over one hundred unique documents with classification markings,” according to a court filing.\n\nBiden Documents at University of Delaware\n\nWhile talking about the Department of Justice’s investigation into his handling of classified documents, Trump repeated a claim that Biden mishandled and hid 1,850 boxes of classified records. “I have every right to [take classified documents] under the Presidential Records,” Trump said. (He doesn’t. See the section above on that act.) “Biden, on the other hand, he has 1,850 boxes.” Later on, Trump claimed that Biden “won’t give back the 1,850 boxes” and that “nobody even knows where they are.”\n\nBut there is no evidence any of the boxes from Biden contain classified information, and their location is known.\n\nAs we’ve written, Biden in 2012 donated more than 1,850 boxes of records from his years in the U.S. Senate to the University of Delaware. The documents are not available for public access following an agreement between Biden and the university at the time of the donation not to provide public access to any of the materials until “two years after the donor [Biden] retires from public life.” In October, a Delaware Superior Court judge upheld the University of Delaware’s refusal to provide access to the documents after the nonprofit Judicial Watch sought them through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe Justice Department, with Biden’s consent, reviewed the documents and did not find any with classified markings, although some were taken for further review, CBS News has reported.\n\n‘Energy Independent’\n\n“We were energy independent” during his administration, Trump said.\n\nThe U.S. never stopped relying on foreign sources of energy under Trump, as his claim suggested. During his presidency, for the first time in decades, the U.S. exported more energy than it imported; produced more energy than it consumed; and again became a net exporter of petroleum, which includes crude oil and refined products from crude oil, such as gasoline and other fuels. Even if “energy independence” was determined by being a net exporter or having more production than consumption, the country’s status has not changed under Biden.\n\nSee “Examining U.S. ‘Energy Independence’ Claims” and “FactChecking Trump’s Presidential Bid Announcement“ for more.\n\nGasoline Prices\n\nTrump falsely claimed that “energy” — a reference to gasoline prices — “went from $1.87 to $5, $6, $7, $8 and even $9.”\n\nThe average price of regular gasoline was $2.38 per gallon the week Trump left office in January 2021, up from a low of $1.77 the final week of April 2020, according to Energy Information Administration figures. Under Biden, the average weekly price reached a record of $5.01 in June 2022. Most recently, the price was down to $3.53 the week of May 8.\n\nThere was at least one California county where gas prices climbed to almost $10 a gallon in June 2022, but the highest average price for all of California — which usually has the country’s most expensive gas — was about $6.44 that month, according to AAA.\n\nAs we have written before, experts have said that U.S. presidents have little influence over gas prices, which are mainly affected by the global price of crude oil, a fossil fuel that is refined into gasoline.\n\nAbortion\n\nTrump claimed that before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, “They could kill the baby in the ninth month or after the baby was born. Now they won’t be able to do that.” As we wrote in 2019 when he made a similar claim, killing a baby is a homicide.\n\nThe 1973 Roe opinion said the government can’t interfere with a right to an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Once a fetus is viable outside the womb, the government could restrict or prohibit abortions — but there must be exceptions for the mother’s life and health, which meant both physical and mental health, the court clarified in a companion case.\n\nTrump also said that abortion rights supporters were in favor of abortions very late in a pregnancy or “after the baby is born.” As we wrote recently, in 2021 and 2022, Democrats introduced a bill that, similar to Roe, would set a viability threshold for state restrictions, permitting abortions to be prohibited after viability but with exceptions for risks to the life or health of the mother. The two political parties disagree on what the “health” exception means, with Republicans viewing it as a loophole.\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned Roe on June 24, 2022, leaving the issue of regulating abortion to the states.\n\nIn 2020, the vast majority of abortions — 93.1% — in the U.S. occurred in the first trimester, at or before 13 weeks of gestation, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Less than 1% were performed at or after 21 weeks. A full-term pregnancy is typically 38 to 42 weeks.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-cnn-town-hall/index.html', 'Headline': 'Trump town hall on CNN: Live updates | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'The Biden campaign is already working to pinpoint moments from the town hall that they can turn into ads and digital content, including Trump’s comments on January 6, election denialism ...', 'Full_text': 'The 2024 presidential campaign is only beginning, but former President Donald Trump made clear that his third bid for the White House will feel very much like the first two.\n\nTrump might be trying a new tack in this campaign, running what is, to date, a more conventional race with less internal drama. But when pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, the 76-year-old showed on Wednesday night that he is very much the same person Americans came to know in 2016, throughout his four years in office, and in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the mostly Trump-loyal audience lapped it up. Trump’s place in the GOP primary polls, as he often mentioned, is strong. In New Hampshire on Wednesday night, he showed why.\n\nHere are some takeaways from Trump’s CNN town hall:\n\nTrump says GOP should be willing to blow up debt ceiling: The US is on the brink of a catastrophic default on its sovereign debt. Asked what his advice is to Republicans in Washington, Trump was clear. “If they don’t give you massive cuts,” he said, “you’re going to have to do a default.” The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking so-called extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.\n\nTrump makes dismissive comments about Carroll: A little more than 24 hours after a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, and awarded her $5 million, the former president denied the accusations and again said he had never met Carroll. “This woman, I don’t know her. I never met her. I have no idea who she is,” Trump said, before going off on an odd tangent about her former husband and a pet.\n\nTrump also brushed off a question over whether the verdict would hurt his standing with female voters, saying he doubted it. The reaction from the Trump-friendly audience appeared to support his opinion – they laughed at his jokes and other dismissive comments about Carroll.\n\nTrump doesn’t say if he would back Ukraine in war with Russia: Trump refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to prevail in its war with invading Russia.“I don’t think in terms of winning and losing,” he said, “I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people.” Asked to choose a side he would prefer to win, Trump again demurred. “I want everyone to stop dying,” he said before promising to end the war in “24 hours.”\n\nTrump suggests family separation immigration policy could return: Trump said he would return to one of the harshest immigration enforcement policies imposed by his administration: separating migrant families at the US-Mexico border. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said. His comments come as Title 42, the Trump-era pandemic public health restriction that became a key tool officials used to expel migrants at the US-Mexico border, is set to expire Thursday.\n\nTrump was vague on federal abortion ban: Trump repeatedly ducked questions about whether he would sign into law a federal abortion ban, as well as questions regarding after how many weeks into a pregnancy abortion should be made illegal. He touted the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade’s federal abortion rights as “such a great victory” – and one made possible by his appointment of three conservative justices. Trump said he supports exemptions to abortion bans for cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is threatened. “We now have a great negotiating ability, and I think we’re going to be able to get something done,” Trump said.\n\nRead more takeaways from tonight’s town hall here and read our team’s fact checks here.\n\nOne of the many jarring moments during CNN’s town hall with former President Donald Trump occurred when the moderator, CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins, was asking Trump why he held on to classified documents when he left the White House. The FBI later recovered them from Mar a Lago by executing a search warrant.\n\nWhen Collins pointed out that the difference between Trump and Joe Biden, who also faces questions about classified documents found at his house but who didn’t ignore a subpoena, Trump interrupted her.\n\n“Are you ready? Can I talk?” Trump demanded. “Do you mind?”\n\n“Yeah, I would like for you to answer the question. That’s why I asked it,” Collins said.\n\n“It’s very simple that you’re a nasty person, I’ll tell you,” Trump said, attempting to insult her as his supporters in the crowd cheered.\n\n“Can you answer why you held on to the documents?” Collins asked again, at which point Trump launched into a rambling answer that boils down to he was negotiating with the National Archives during the year-plus when the government was seeking them.\n\nIt’s the insult to Collins’ face, calling her “nasty,” that was jarring. And the cheering crowd made it more so.\n\nThe word has long been a favorite insult of Trump’s, often hurled at women who frustrate him.\n\nHe called Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman” at the close of the final presidential debate in 2016.\n\nHe’s used it on Vice President Kamala Harris and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nOf Meghan Markle, who had criticized him, in 2019, Trump told a British newspaper, “I didn’t know that she was nasty.”\n\nAfter he hurled the insult at Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen later that summer, the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake documented 14 times Trump had used the insult to describe a woman. He found even more instances of Trump using the word to describe a man, although some of those appeared to be complements.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed that the classified documents from the White House were “automatically declassified” when he took them to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence to back up this assertion. Trump and his team have not provided any proof that Trump actually conducted some sort of broad declassification of the documents that ended up at Mar-a-Lago – and, so far, his lawyers notably have not argued in their court filings that Trump did so.\n\nThe Justice Department said in an August 2022 court filing that Trump’s representatives never asserted that documents had been declassified—not in January 2022 when they voluntarily turned over 15 boxes that included 184 unique documents with classification markings, nor in June 2022 when Trump’s team responded to a subpoena by returning another batch that included 38 additional unique documents with classification markings.\n\nIn addition, 18 former top Trump administration officials, including two former White House chiefs of staff who spoke on the record, told CNN at the time that they never heard of a standing Trump declassification order when they were serving in the administration and that they now believe the claim is false. The former officials used words like “ludicrous,” “ridiculous” and “bullsh*t.”\n\n“Total nonsense,” said one person who served as a senior White House official. “If that’s true, where is the order with his signature on it? If that were the case, there would have been tremendous pushback from the Intel Community and DoD, which would almost certainly have become known to Intel and Armed Services Committees on the Hill.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump asserted Wednesday night that “a couple” of the January 6 rioters “probably got out of control,” comparing the insurrection to left-leaning protests that turned violent in other cities.\n\nFacts First: This statement is false. Hundreds of rioters have been charged with violence toward police on January 6 and Trump downplaying of the violence and equivocating the insurrection with social justice protests fails to recognize the severity of the attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe January 6 riot of by Trump supporters who overran the Capitol has resulted in the largest law enforcement response in modern history – because of the sheer amount of violence on the ground, especially toward police, that day.\n\nThe number of rioters who’ve been charged with violence toward police is in the hundreds.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department this week, 346 people face federal charges for assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or other employees. That includes more than 100 people charged with using a weapon or causing serious injury to an officer. About five dozen have pleaded guilty to felony charges for these types of crimes.\n\nAnd the FBI is still seeking information to identify more than 220 others who may have committed violent crimes on the Capitol grounds.\n\nEven Trump-appointed federal judges have countered claims that left-leaning rioters in Portland, for instance, acted similarly to the pro-Trump crowd on January 6.\n\nJudge Trevor McFadden wrote when handling a January 6 rioter’s case in 2021: “Although both Portland and January 6 rioters attacked federal buildings, the Portland defendants primarily attacked at night, meaning that they raged against a largely vacant courthouse. In contrast, the January 6 rioters attacked the Capitol in broad daylight. And many entered it.”\n\nAnd another federal judge in DC, Carl Nichols, wrote: “The Portland rioters’ conduct, while obviously serious, did not target a proceeding prescribed by the Constitution and established to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Nor did the Portland rioters, unlike those who assailed America’s Capitol in 2021, make it past the buildings’ outer defenses.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s answers to questions from New Hampshire voters about a variety of topics at the CNN town hall Wednesday may have opened the door for other Republicans to challenge him in the 2024 presidential primary race, Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House director of communications and CNN political commentator, said.\n\nThe former president often dodged directly answering questions and giving specific policy stances in the town hall, such as not saying if he would sign a federal abortion ban or if he wanted Ukraine or Russia to win the war. Trump repeated his election lies and attempted to repaint his role during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nIssues like crime and the economy, however, are what are on the minds of most voters on a day-to-day basis, Farah Griffin said.\n\nFarah Griffin pointed to a statement from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ super PAC criticizing Trump as an example of how other candidates could be taking advantage.\n\n“After 76 years, Trump still doesn’t know where he stands on important conservative issues like supporting life and the 2nd amendment. How does that Make America Great Again?” the statement said.\n\nThe super PAC in a tweet also touched on several issues including possible pardons for January 6 rioters and the investigation into classified documents at Mar-a-Lago — topics that DeSantis has not criticized Trump over and in some cases has outright avoided discussing at all.\n\n“This to me actually became an opening for a Republican to take him on and say, if you want a lot of the policies — not insane things like family separation — and you don’t want chaos and anti-democratic positions,” Farah Griffin said.\n\nCNN’s Steve Contorno and Alayna Treene contributed reporting to this post.\n\nFormer and current Republican governors reacted to former President Trump’s claims throughout CNN’s town hall in New Hampshire on Wednesday evening.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu: The Republican governor told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that Trump didn’t say anything that he thinks will help him win the GOP nomination for president. “It was kind of the same old thing, the same old regurgitation. He had a chance to move on from 2020, he didn’t do it. He had a chance to own some of the issues of January 6, what his role there was. He didn’t do it. He had the chance to take shots at Joe Biden, he didn’t do it,” Sununu said.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie: After Donald Trump said he would end Russia’s war in Ukraine in 24 hours, the Republican tweeted that “despite how ridiculous that is to say, I suspect he would try to do it by turning Ukraine over to Putin and Russia. #Putin’sPuppet.”\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson: The 2024 challenger to Trump said on CNN that the former president “had a weak performance and he’s locked in the past.”\n\n“He had a goal, I’m sure, to expand his base to be able to prove that he can attract independents and the suburban voters. He failed that test. He narrowed his base of support, he’s locked in the past, he didn’t address the issues (of) the future,” the Republican said.\n\n“Whenever he was asked about the economy, he gave one brief response on energy policy, but really didn’t address the broad range of things we have in our economy to get it going again,” he added.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took questions from Republican and undeclared voters in New Hampshire at the town hall moderated by “CNN This Morning” anchor Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday night.\n\nTrump remained defiant about his lies regarding the 2020 election, as well as the many investigations into him – making clear that he’s sticking to the script he’s delivered over the past two years on conservative media.\n\nHere is some of what he said on key topics:\n\nElection lies: Trump again refused to acknowledge that he lost the 2020 presidential election several times, and instead reiterated false claims that the election was rigged. CNN’s Collins continuously pushed back and pointed to statements by Trump’s own election officials noting the election was conducted fairly. He later only said he would accept the 2024 presidential election results if he believed they were “honest.”\n\nJanuary 6 insurrection: Trump blamed then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi among others, saying they were at fault for the security failures on January 6, 2021. Trump falsely claimed that he called on the National Guard to intervene during the riot and in an extended exchange with Collins about the riot, Trump attempted to repaint his role during the insurrection. He also said he would pardon “a large portion” of rioters.\n\nMike Pence: Trump said that he does not feel like he owes his former vice president an apology. Pence has said the former president endangered his life during the January 6 insurrection. “No, because he did something wrong. He should’ve put the votes back to the state legislatures and I think we would’ve had a different outcome,” Trump said, though Pence did not have the authority to reject election results.\n\nE. Jean Carroll: Trump continued to deny knowing the columnist and denied accusations, just a day after a jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her in a department store. The former president also ridiculed Carroll and said he does not believe the verdict disqualifies him from being president or will have an impact on women voters.\n\nThe economy: If reelected, Trump said his solution to inflation would be drilling for more oil in the US. The former president then claimed that under his presidency, the country was energy independent and that the cost of gas went down to record lows. You can read a fact check on those claims here.\n\nThe debt ceiling: Trump said the US should default on its debt if the White House does not agree to Republican spending cuts. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit. The White House and GOP Republicans are in a standoff over how to resolve the issue.\n\nGun violence: The former president pledged to protect the Second Amendment if he is back in the White House. He said he would address mental health problems as well as “do numerous things” to address mass shootings, including hiring more security guards for schools and what he called “hardening” entrances to establishments.\n\nAbortion: Trump would not say if he would sign a federal abortion ban if he was reelected or at how many weeks during pregnancy he would support a ban. Trump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country.” He argued those in the anti-abortion movement are “in a very good negotiating position right now” because of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe war in Ukraine: Trump said he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and with Russian President Vladimir Putin and solve the war in Ukraine “in one day, 24 hours.” He would not say if he believed Putin was a war criminal and said the Russian leader “made a mistake” going into Ukraine, arguing he wouldn’t have done so if Trump was president. Trump wouldn’t say whether he wants Ukraine or Russia to win the war.\n\nClassified documents: The former president insisted that he had “every right” to take classified documents with him after he left the White House. He falsely claimed that the documents became declassified when he took them with him.\n\nAsked why he took classified documents with him after leaving the White House, former President Donald Trump said he “had every right to under the Presidential Records Act.”\n\n“I was there and I took what I took and it gets declassified,” Trump said during Wednesday night’s CNN town hall.\n\nCollins corrected Trump saying the Presidential Records Act does not say a former president can take documents home but says they are the property of the federal government when a president is out of office.\n\nAfter Trump and Collins went back and forth on previous presidents taking classified documents, Collins pushed back saying previous presidents didn’t wait to return classified documents and asked numerous times why Trump waited to return classified documents when he knew the federal government was seeking them and subpoenaed him to return them.\n\nTrump did not answer the question but instead insulted Collins.\n\n“It’s very simple — you’re a nasty person, I’ll tell you,” Trump said.\n\nMore context: Special counsel Jack Smith is overseeing the Justice Department’s criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and into parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were taken to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury has interviewed potential witnesses regarding how Trump handled the documents.\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records.\n\nAny unauthorized retention or destruction of White House documents could violate a criminal law that prohibits the removal or destruction of official government records, legal experts told CNN.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Wednesday would not say whether he would sign a federal abortion ban if reelected when pressed several times by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, but argued those in the anti-abortion movement are “in a very good negotiating position right now” because of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nTrump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country” when asked if he would sign a federal abortion ban.\n\nAs many states move to restrict abortion rights after the Supreme Court ruled there is no constitutional right to an abortion, Trump would not specify whether he would support a federal ban or at how many weeks during a pregnancy he would support a ban.\n\n“I’m looking at a solution that’s going to work. Very complex issue for the country. You have people on both sides of an issue, but we are now in a very strong position. Pro-life people are in a strong position to make a deal that’s going to be good and going to be satisfactory for them. If you weren’t able to get rid of, you wouldn’t be having a discussion, if you weren’t able to get rid of Roe V. Wade,” Trump said.\n\nMore context: In the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, many Republican-led states have enacted sweeping abortion restrictions. But unpopularity, demonstrated in some instances by electoral evidence, over severe restrictions has prompted Republicans to reconsider the political wisdom of enacting near-total bans on the procedure, and House Republicans have recently stepped away from pushing a federal abortion ban.\n\nMarta Saravia, an undeclared voter, asked former President Donald Trump what he thought of the debt situation and how the country can move forward.\n\n“We have to start paying off debt … I say to the Republicans out there — Congressmen, Senators — if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default, and I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave will absolutely cave because you don’t want to have that happen, but it’s better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors,” Trump said.\n\nCollins asked Trump to clarify, asking him if he thinks the US should default if the White House does not agree to spending cuts the Republicans are demanding.\n\nMore context: The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.\n\nThe White House and GOP Republicans are in a standoff over how to resolve the issue. House Republicans want to attach spending reductions to a debt ceiling increase and have passed a debt limit plan that does just that. But Biden and congressional Democrats have insisted on passing a clean increase on the debt limit before addressing a framework for spending.\n\nA breach of the US debt ceiling risks sparking a 2008-style economic catastrophe that wipes out millions of jobs and sets America back for generations, Moody’s Analytics has warned. The impact could include delayed Social Security payments, late paychecks for federal employees and veterans and a direct hit to Americans’ investments.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he does not think a recent verdict in which a Manhattan federal jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room disqualifies him from being president or will have an impact on women voters.\n\nHe denied knowing the columnist and denied the accusations. Trump ridiculed Carroll while discussing the trial, only a day after the verdict was handed down.\n\n“A Manhattan jury found you sexually abused writer E. Jean You’ve denied this. But what do you say to voters who say it disqualifies you from being president?” CNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked.\n\nTrump answered that he didn’t think there were many voters who would think that. He claimed that the case was made up and that it was all politically motivated. He repeated that he did not know Carroll, but said that he took a photo “years ago” with her and her husband.\n\nWhen asked if the jury’s decision would deter women from voting for him, the former president said, “No, I don’t think so.”\n\nSome context: A Manhattan federal jury found Tuesday that Trump sexually abused Carroll in the spring of 1996 and awarded her $5 million for battery and defamation.\n\nCarroll alleged Trump raped her in the Bergdorf Goodman department store and then defamed her when he denied her claim, said she wasn’t his type and suggested she made up the story to boost sales of her book. Trump denied all wrongdoing. He does not face any jail time as a result of the civil verdict.\n\nWhile the jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, the jury did not find that Carroll proved he raped her.\n\nCarroll filed the lawsuit last November under the “New York State Adult Survivors Act,” a state bill that opened a look-back window for sexual assault allegations like Carroll’s with long-expired statutes of limitation.\n\nThere’s a definite feel at Saint Anselm College that the 2024 presidential campaign is really beginning tonight. There’s excitement, tension and dissent in the air that recalls the build-up to a presidential debate.\n\nThe fact that the unpredictable Donald Trump is the presidential frontrunner after a tumultuous presidency and refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election is only deepening the feeling that something big is about to happen – as town hall attendees line up to clear Secret Service security checks near protesters shouting anti-Trump slogans.\n\nMany of the registered Republicans and voters who plan to vote in the 2024 GOP primary are hoping they will get called upon.\n\nOne Trump supporter, Karen Langella, said that she hoped that the questions would “not focus on what happened” on Tuesday when a jury found Trump sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in 1996 in New York and that he was liable for battery and defamation after a civil trial.\n\nLangella’s daughter, Isabella, who is an independent and shopping around for the most conservative Republican candidate, hoped that “people stick to his ideas and his policies instead of what happened 20 years ago.”\n\nAnother attendee, Al Peel, hoped to get a question to Trump about his own ideas on how to help homeless veterans. He also wanted the former president to tone down his wild antics and focus instead on policies.\n\n“I think he’s Bozo the Clown, OK. But I love his results,” he added.\n\nAcross the road, a crowd of students held up signs reading “love Trumps hate” and “nobody is above the law,” while chanting “You’re abhorrent, you’re broke, you lost the popular vote.”\n\nMore about the town hall location: Saint Anselm College has its own fabled history in presidential campaigns. Republican Richard Nixon made it his first stop in his successful 1968 bid for the presidency. Pretty much every one who is anyone in presidential politics has visited — from Ronald Reagan, both presidents Bush, Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe Benedictine liberal arts college hosted a fiery Democratic presidential debate days before the 2008 primary that saw Hillary Clinton win a comeback victory after Barack Obama won the Iowa caucuses — though it was a false dawn for the then New York senator’s campaign.\n\nIt’s long been known that former President Donald Trump’s actions while in office have upended the norms of the presidency — from his use of social media to make major announcements to his use of the pardon power to the amount of turnover in his administration.\n\nThe story of the Trump presidency cannot be fully told in numbers. But here are some numbers illustrate some of the many ways Trump and his administration defied the status quo of the executive branch.\n\nJudicial appointments: Trump was able to successfully appoint three US Supreme Court justices, and he’s surpassed the number of federal judges appointed by George H.W. Bush — the most recent one-term president.\n\nEarlier in 2020, Trump was also on track to appoint more federal appellate judges than any recent president at the same point in his presidency, according to the Pew Research Center. Although Trump served only four years, his changes to the makeup of federal courts will be felt long after he leaves the White House.\n\nExecutive action: As of December 11, 2020, there had been 520 presidential documents signed by Trump — including executive orders, presidential memorandums, determinations and notices — had been published in the Federal Register. Of those, 288 were executive orders and presidential memorandums, not including memos were clerical in nature.\n\nPresidents have increasingly used executive orders and presidential memorandums interchangeably to issue directives to their agencies; they are both legally binding, though executive action can be undone by the next president.\n\nThe increased reliance on such actions has come as an increasingly gridlocked Congress has made it difficult for presidents to act on their agendas.\n\nObama had issued 226 executive orders and memorandums at this point in his tenure in office, while George W. Bush had signed 189.\n\nBefore becoming president, Trump complained about what he saw as Obama’s overuse of executive authority but also suggested that the government could be run like a business.\n\nYet Trump has already exceeded both George W. Bush and Obama in the number of published executive orders and memorandums.\n\nRead about other key figures from his presidency here.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign is pursuing a strategy of expanding his appeal by reaching out to audiences beyond friendly conservative media outlets, multiple advisers familiar with the strategy said, including a CNN town hall this week.\n\nThe town hall event in New Hampshire Wednesday evening, Trump’s first appearance on CNN since the 2016 election, joins a list of other signs that Trump is adopting a more traditional campaign in his third run for the White House.\n\nThe former president has surrounded himself with a more organized, experienced team to complement his unconventional campaign style. He’s also scaling back larger rallies, a Trump campaign trademark, for more intimate campaign settings and retail stops that allow the former president to engage with voters.\n\nThat approach speaks to an acknowledgment by the Trump campaign and its allies that the former president must broaden his appeal inside and outside the Republican Party if he is to clinch the GOP nomination and retake the White House in 2024, following his failed reelection bid and disappointing results by Republicans in last year’s midterm elections. The process is being driven by a team of veteran political operatives, skilled in matters such as the delegate process, who believe Trump’s path to victory cannot simply be a reprisal of his insurgent 2016 bid or his large, expensive 2020 operation.\n\nThe former president’s team has increased its outreach with traditional news outlets, taking questions from television and print correspondents on recent campaign swings from organizations Trump has spent years attacking.\n\nTrump’s team also sees the town hall has an opportunity to draw a contrast with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has clashed with what he often refers to as “legacy media” organizations.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nWednesday’s live town hall audience will be made up of Republicans and undeclared voters who plan to vote in the GOP primary.\n\nThis is Trump’s third trip to the Granite State since launching his campaign last fall. He handily won the primaries there in 2016 and 2020 before losing the state in both general elections.\n\nNew Hampshire is the second state to vote in the Republican presidential nominating calendar — but after the Iowa caucuses, it’s the first primary to take place.\n\nThe Granite State has long prized its role in vetting presidential contenders, and state law protects that status: Secretary of State David Scanlan is required to set a primary date a week ahead of any other “similar contests” elsewhere on the map. Democrats have reshuffled their primary calendar, leaving some dates in flux, but the GOP has maintained New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary status.\n\nThough New Hampshire is among the smallest states in delegate counts, it has a history of propelling primary winners forward toward Super Tuesday with momentum — and winnowing out candidates who fail to gain traction there.\n\nThe winners of the last two competitive New Hampshire Republican presidential primaries, Mitt Romney in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016 went on to win the party’s nomination.\n\nNew Hampshire’s primary allows “undeclared” voters — those who are not registered as Democrats or Republicans — to choose which primary they participate in. It’s a key voting bloc since about two-in-five New Hampshire voters are undeclared.\n\nThe process has its quirks: Three tiny locations, Dixville Notch, Hart’s Location and Millsfield, vote at midnight and report their tiny numbers of votes immediately. Those vote tallies aren’t large enough sample sizes to be indicative of anything, but they are the only known results for nearly 20 hours, until polls elsewhere close that evening.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination, will take questions from New Hampshire Republicans and undeclared voters in a CNN town hall Wednesday as a myriad of legal issues loom over his 2024 White House bid.\n\nThe town hall will be moderated by “CNN This Morning” anchor Kaitlan Collins at Saint Anselm College and is Trump’s first appearance on the network since 2016.\n\nTrump is set to face voters as he deals with unprecedented legal clouds hanging over him and as he seeks to become only the second commander-in-chief, ever, elected to two non-consecutive terms.\n\nThe town hall comes just a day after a Manhattan federal jury found the former president sexually abused E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in 1996 and awarded her $5 million for battery and defamation.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing and called the verdict in the civil case a “total disgrace.”\n\nLast month in New York, he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump also faces potential legal peril in both Washington, DC — where a special counsel is leading a pair of investigations — and in Georgia, where the Fulton County district attorney plans to announce charges this summer from the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State.\n\nStill, the twice-impeached former president has repeatedly said that any charges will not stop him from running for president, dismissing all of the investigations as politically motivated witch hunts.\n\nThat’s a view many GOP voters share, according to recent surveys. Nearly 70% of Republican primary voters in a recent NBC News poll said investigations into the former president “are politically motivated” and that “no other candidate is like him, we must support him.”\n\nWhile a handful of rivals have entered the Republican presidential primary, and Trump’s biggest potential rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, has not yet officially launched a bid — Trump has maintained a healthy lead in early GOP primary polling.\n\nIn a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday, 43% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents named Trump unprompted when asked who they would like to see the party nominate in 2024, compared with 20% naming DeSantis, and 2% or less naming any other candidate.\n\nTrump’s participation in the town hall is indicative of a broader campaign strategy to try to expand his appeal beyond conservative media viewers, CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported earlier Wednesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump enters Wednesday’s CNN town hall as both the prohibitive GOP frontrunner for the 2024 nomination and a man just found liable in a civil case for sexually abusing and defaming former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n\nWhile we cannot yet know what effect that verdict will have on the race for the Republican nomination, Trump’s large polling advantage was built with this civil trial in the news and after being indicted earlier this spring in a separate criminal case related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. (Trump has denied all wrongdoing.)\n\nThe leads Trump has in surveys of Republican voters and in endorsements from elected officials at this stage are some of the strongest for a nonincumbent in the modern presidential primary era.\n\nTrump is polling, on average, north of 50% in national polls of likely GOP primary voters. His nearest potential challenger – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has yet to launch a campaign – is earning a little north of 20% of the Republican primary vote on average. No other potential Republican candidate is in double digits.\n\nThere are very few candidates, of either party, in nonincumbent races who were near or north of 50% in the national primary polls this early on. Those included Republicans Bob Dole in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000, and Democrats Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. All of those candidates won their party’s nominations, and none of those races were particularly close.\n\nInterestingly, all the legal controversies involving Trump have not hurt him in the polls. At the beginning of the year, Trump was earning a little more than 40% of the vote, on average, and was only about 10 points ahead of DeSantis. Trump’s lead is now triple that at closer to 30 points, on average.\n\nYou can read more about the polls here.\n\nThe first reaction to Tuesday’s unprecedented verdict finding a former president and current White House candidate liable for sexual abuse offered no reason to suggest that Donald Trump’s position as the frontrunner for the GOP nomination is under any immediate threat.\n\nBut some of his GOP critics raised questions about his fitness for office that are certain to be at the center of the next general election if he is the Republican nominee.\n\nThe unanimous verdict could deepen his vulnerability among key voting groups, including women – among whom the GOP needs to improve to win back the White House.\n\nThe jury found Trump sexually abused former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll in a New York Department store in 1996 and that he was liable for battery and defamation, while awarding her $5 million. The unanimous jury verdict was vindication for Carroll and offered a symbolic win for other women who have made assault allegations against the president. Trump, who has denied all wrongdoing, immediately denounced the trial as a witch hunt and said he didn’t even know Carroll. He said later Tuesday evening that he will appeal.\n\nFor most of modern US history and for most candidates, Tuesday’s developments would raise potentially insurmountable questions of viability. Many White House hopefuls have exited presidential races for less. And Trump, who’s pleaded not guilty in a separate criminal case involving hush money payments to an adult film star in New York, is facing multiple legal threats. He’s waiting to see whether he will be indicted in separate probes into his attempt to overthrow the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents. But the fact that Trump won’t quit the GOP race – and no one will make him – shows his dominance of the Republican Party, and how he redefined behavioral expectations for public life.\n\nRead the full analysis here.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://theweek.com/donald-trump/1009063/trump-mocks-and-criticizes-biden-at-rally-in-arizona', 'Headline': 'Trump mocks and criticizes Biden at rally in Arizona', 'Snippet': 'published 16 January 2022.

Among the dozen or so Trump supporters there who spoke to CNN, grand conspiracy theories – all of which have been debunked – about how the 2020 election was supposedly rigged (like through voting machines linked to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013) seem to have given way to more refined talking points that closely align with restrictive voting measures being enacted by Republicans across the country.\n\n“There’s a famous statement – ‘sometimes the vote counter is more important than the candidate,’ ” Trump said in a video posted online Friday, underscoring how Republicans motivated by his election lies have sought to undermine the legitimacy of America’s elections. Arizona – which President Joe Biden carried in 2020, becoming the first Democrat to carry the state since 1996 – has been at the center of those efforts.\n\nIn Florence on Saturday, Trump showed exactly what kind of “vote counters” he approves of.\n\nSpeaking at his rally, Kari Lake, Trump’s pick for governor, said there were a few people she “would like to send right down to the prison here in Florence. Anybody who was involved in that corrupt, shady, shoddy election of 2020. Lock them up.”\n\nMark Finchem, an Arizona state representative whom Trump has endorsed to be the state’s top election official as secretary of state, has previously echoed QAnon-type conspiracy theories about election officials and continues to maintain that the vote in Arizona was stolen from Trump, which has been widely disproved. Even a partisan audit of results in Maricopa County, commissioned by state Senate Republicans, affirmed Biden’s victory in the county.\n\nFinchem has previously been linked to the Oath Keepers, a right-wing extremist group. Some of its members were charged last week with “seditious conspiracy” related to the US Capitol attack.\n\n“I look forward to the day that we set aside an irredeemably flawed election. That’s the election of 2020. With all the evidence we have, the Arizona election should be decertified with cause by the legislature,” Finchem said, repeating the former President’s lies from the podium at his rally Saturday.\n\nA year’s-long sustained attack on the integrity of American elections has paved the way to make candidates like these the natural choice in 2022 for Trump, who’s trying to exercise his influence over the GOP – including local election officials – at the same time he’s eyeing another bid for the White House in 2024. A recent Washington Post tally found that “at least 163 Republicans who have embraced Trump’s false claims are running for statewide positions that would give them authority over the administration of elections.”\n\nBut also at the Trump rally was rare praise for a Democrat.\n\n“She’s our representative, she represents the state, she is not along party lines, she’s what’s good for the country,” Robbie Kimsey, an Arizona voter and Trump supporter, said of Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nSinema, along with Sen. Joe Machin of West Virginia, is blocking the passage of a pair of voting rights bills that Democrats hope could counter some of the restrictive voting measures enacted by Republicans at the state level. Sinema has said she is supportive of the bills but not in favor of changing Senate rules to get them passed.\n\nThe opposition of these two moderate Democrats is frustrating voting rights activists, including those who gathered in Arizona this weekend.\n\n“She says she wants voting rights, but how do you want voting rights without creating a path for that to happen? That is inconsistent; that is unacceptable,” Martin Luther King Jr.’s son Martin Luther King III told CNN in Phoenix on Saturday.\n\nThe King family had traveled to Arizona to take part in a voting rights march, calling on Sinema to act – warning that history would not judge her kindly.\n\n“I think we are really at a defining moment,” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democratic hopeful for governor, told CNN.\n\nHobbs said democracy had prevailed in 2020 because election officials on both sides of the aisle had done their jobs – but now, with Trump-endorsed election deniers running for jobs that would give them authority over elections, the future is less certain.\n\n“The election in 2022, I think, is going to determine the future of our democracy,” Hobbs said.\n\nThat was a sentiment echoed by Yolanda Renee King, Martin Luther King Jr.’s 13-year-old granddaughter, who was with her family this weekend in Phoenix, telling CNN, “I think it’s so important to vote and it’s so important to have the right to vote, because right now our country is at stake.”'}}",92.5,1

In that same discussion, held three days before the official count of electors in Congress, Trump weighed the pros and cons of placing Clark atop the Justice Department to ensure the letter would be sent to pivotal states.\n\nTrump’s treatment of Justice officials represents one piece of an emerging historical record that committee members say proves he orchestrated a sprawling campaign to invalidate his defeat. At the same time he was trying to strong-arm the Justice Department, Trump’s campaign lawyers were pressuring state officials to overturn results and organizing slates of fake electors.\n\nSince the Watergate scandal, most presidents have worked to project a laissez-faire approach to the Justice Department, allowing the agency to operate independently and as apolitically as possible. But throughout his time in office, Trump ignored those norms and sought to treat the agency as his own legal department.\n\n“It was a brazen attempt to use the Justice Department to advance the president’s personal political agenda,” Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said Thursday.\n\nDuring the Jan. 3 meeting — just three days before the official certification of electors in Congress — Trump wrestled with whether to make a change at the top of the department.\n\n“What do I have to lose?” he asked.\n\nBut the conversation occurred in a moment in which he was trying to project strength and stability. He was told by advisers that there would be an embarrassing spate of resignations at Justice if he put Clark in charge. Advisers told him Clark — who was in the room — was not competent to run the agency.\n\nTrump relented. Clark was not promoted. The letter was never sent.\n\nBut Trump’s effort to enlist the nation’s top law enforcement officials fits into the committee’s case that he intended to use all available tools — regardless of laws, norms or precedent — to defy voters and cling to power.\n\nClark has become a central figure to the investigation around Jan. 6. Federal agents visited Clark’s home Wednesday, according to a U.S. attorney’s office spokesman. In a statement, Russ Vought, a former Trump administration official and Clark’s employer at the Center for Renewing America, criticized the “raid” as political.\n\nIllinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the panel, led the questioning of three witnesses Thursday: Rosen, Donoghue and former Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel.\n\nThe panel has already aired recorded testimony from former Attorney General Bill Barr, who said he told Trump in December 2020 that the election was not stolen. Barr, who had said in an interview with The Associated Press that Justice had uncovered no evidence of fraud, resigned before the year was out.\n\nIn its four previous public hearings, the committee presented evidence — through documents and witness testimony — about the physical attack on the Capitol, Trump being advised that he had lost, Trump’s efforts to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence and state officials to aid his effort to stop Joe Biden from taking office, and his team’s scheme to replace official electors from seven states with slates of “fake electors.”\n\nAt an earlier hearing, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., promised to name lawmakers who had sought pardons from Trump in the waning days of his presidency. The committee delivered on Thursday, playing recordings of testimony about Rep. Matt Gaetz’s effort to secure a broad pardon from Trump.\n\nA federal grand jury is investigating whether Gaetz, R-Fla., committed any crimes in connection with a sex-trafficking case. He has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime.\n\nThe committee also revealed that it had received evidence that several other Republican lawmakers had inquired about getting pardons: Reps.

Elaine Luria, D-Va., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., used witness testimony to piece together Trump\'s actions the afternoon of Jan. 6, as there was not an official call log from the White House that afternoon and nothing included in the presidential daily diary.\n\n""The chief White House photographer wanted to take pictures because it was, in her words, \'very important for his archives and for history.\' But she was told: \'no photographs\',"" Luria said.\n\nWhite House counsel and White House officials testified that Trump did not make any calls to the secretary of defense, the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security during the siege.\n\nAlthough the White House call logs are empty, Trump lawyer and ally Rudy Giuliani\'s call logs show at least two calls between him and the president that day. The committee also noted that other Trump calls that day are known, including several to Republican senators to urge them to delay the certification of Biden\'s win.\n\n\'I\'ve seen the impact that his words have on his supporters\'\n\nA major theme from the hearing was how much television the former president consumed as the chaos and violence unfolded.\n\n""President Trump sat in his dining room and watched the attack on television while his senior-most staff closest advisers and family members begged him to do what is expected of any American president,"" Luria said. ""When lives and our democracy hung in the balance, President Trump refused to act because of his selfish desire to stay in power.""\n\nThe committee played video clips of news coverage from Fox News, to show what Trump watched in real time as he tuned in from his dining room, just off from the Oval Office. He watched as his supporters, donning red caps and chanting his name, overwhelmed and outnumbered police as they flooded the Capitol grounds and attempted to breach the Capitol.\n\nAt 1:49 p.m. ET, just as D.C. police were declaring a riot at the Capitol, Trump tweeted out a video of his speech at the Ellipse earlier that day and did not comment on the violence.\n\nKizinger noted that between 1:49 and 2:24, when Trump posted a subsequent tweet, ""staff repeatedly came into the room to see him and plead that he make a strong public statement condemning the violence and instructing the mob to leave the Capitol.""\n\nThe panel shared video testimony from top advisers and his children imploring Trump to call off the attack.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, a former White House staffer, has previously testified to a conversation between White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\n""I remember [Cipollone] saying something to the effect of, \'Mark we need to do something more. They\'re literally calling for the vice president to be effing hung.\'\n\nHutchinson recalled Meadow responding: \'You heard him Pat, he thinks Mike deserves it, he doesn\'t think they\'re doing anything wrong.\' ""\n\nTrump eventually relented to calls from his aides and allies and recorded a video in the Rose Garden late that afternoon to tell his supporters to leave the Capitol.\n\nThe committee shared a draft of his remarks, which read: ""I\'m asking for you to leave the Capitol region now and go home in a peaceful way.""\n\nBut in the video, Trump went off script, and didn\'t say those words. Instead, he repeated his false claim that the election was stolen and praised the rioters, saying, ""Go home, we love you.""\n\nThursday\'s witnesses were Trump aides who resigned following Jan. 6\n\nTestifying live Thursday were Matthew Pottinger, Trump\'s deputy national security adviser at the time, and Sarah Matthews, Trump\'s deputy press secretary. The pair resigned following the events of Jan. 6, dismayed by what they deemed an inadequate response from the president at quelling the violence.\n\nMatthews recalled the 2:24 p.m. ET tweet from Trump that read, in part: ""Pence didn\'t have the courage to do what should have been done.""\n\n""I thought that the tweet about the vice president was the last thing that was needed in that moment. And I remember thinking that this was going to be bad for him to tweet this because it was essentially him giving the green light to these people telling them that what they were doing at the Capitol and entering the Capitol was OK, that they were justified in their anger,"" said Matthews, who described herself as a ""life-long Republican"".\n\nShe added that as a Trump campaign aide, she had seen the impact his words had on his supporters. ""They truly latch on to every word and every tweet that he says, and so I think that in that moment for him to tweet out the message about Mike Pence, it was him pouring gasoline on the fire,"" she said.\n\nMatthews said White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her ""in a hushed tone"" that Trump ""did not want to include any sort of mention of peace in that tweet.""\n\nShe said McEnany told her ""it took some convincing on their part those who were in the room and she said that there was a back and forth going over different phrases to find something that he was comfortable with, and it wasn\'t until Ivanka Trump suggested the phrase \'stay peaceful\', that he finally agreed to include it.""\n\nPottinger said he was ""disturbed"" by Trump\'s tweet attacking Pence and that it was ""the opposite of what we really needed in that moment which was a de-escalation.""\n\nThe panel described one of Trump\'s final interactions on Jan. 6, as he departed the White House dining room at 6:27 p.m. ET to go to the residence.\n\n""As he was gathering his things in the dining room to leave, President Trump reflected on the day\'s events with an unnamed White House employee,"" Kinzinger said, adding the employee recalled Trump saying: ""Mike Pence let me down.""\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIn his closing statement, Kinzinger said Trump abandoned his responsibilities as commander-in-chief on Jan. 6.\n\n""Whatever your politics, whatever you think about the outcome of the election, we as Americans must all agree on this: Donald Trump\'s conduct on Jan. 6 was a supreme violation of his oath of office and a complete dereliction of his duty to our nation,"" he said. ""It is a dishonor to all those who have sacrificed and died in service of our democracy.""\n\nHe said when the committee releases its report, it will recommend ""changes to laws and policies to guard against another January 6.""'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-us-canada-62259739', 'Headline': 'Trump chose not to act during Capitol riot, committee says - BBC', 'Snippet': ""The panel is arguing that Trump did nothing to rein in the mob of his supporters over 187 perilous minutes. ...

""I just want to say Congress has certified the results.”\n\nHe also refuses to say that rioters broke the law. ""I can\'t say that,"" he says.\n\nThe Republican rebuttal on Twitter\n\nAs many critics of the committee have repeatedly noted, it is a panel largely run by Democrats and it does not provide equal time for the points of view held by many Republicans.\n\nThat has to do with how the committee came together - after House Republicans refused to co-operate on the creation of a bipartisan probe in the style of the committee that investigated the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\nNevertheless, the official Twitter account for Republicans in the House of Representatives has been live-tweeting pithy comments on behalf of the party throughout the hearing:\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January.

The releases have shed new light on how the House committee conducted its investigation of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol – and new details about what key witnesses told the panel.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from the latest disclosures:\n\nTrump wanted to trademark ‘Rigged Election!’ days after 2020 election, emails show\n\nThen-President Donald Trump wanted to trademark the phrase “Rigged Election!” days after Election Day in 2020, according to emails provided by Jared Kushner to the House select committee.\n\nOn November 9, 2020, then-Trump aide Dan Scavino emailed Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, with the request from Trump.\n\n“Hey Jared! POTUS wants to trademark/own rights to below, I don’t know who to see – or ask…I don’t know who to take to,” the email from Scavino reads, according to a transcript of Kushner’s testimony to the committee, which was released by the panel on Friday.\n\nTwo phrases were bolded in the email: “Save America PAC!” and “Rigged Election!”\n\nKushner forwarded the request and discussed it on an email chain that included Eric Trump, the president’s son; Alex Cannon, a Trump campaign lawyer; Sean Dollman, the chief financial officer of Trump’s 2020 campaign; and Justin Clark, a Trump campaign lawyer.\n\n“Guys - can we do ASAP please?” Kushner wrote.\n\nEric Trump responded, saying: “Both web URLs are already registered. Save America PAC was registered October 23 of this year. Was that done by the campaign?”\n\nDollman responded: “‘Save America PAC’ is already taken/registered, just confirming that. But we can still file for ‘Save America.’”\n\nKushner’s response, according to the transcript, was: “Go.”\n\nGiuliani explains Trump team pivot to state legislatures\n\nA feeling that courts weren’t comfortable with Trump’s legal challenges to the 2020 election drove the Trump team’s pivot to state legislatures, former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the select committee earlier this year.\n\nThe theory that the US Constitution lets state legislatures intervene in the presidential election results first came up within the week after the election, Giuliani told congressional investigators. But he and then-fellow Trump attorney Jenna Ellis looked more closely at the idea when the lawsuits challenging the results weren’t getting traction.\n\n“We just got a bad feeling that these judges didn’t – they didn’t want to hear witnesses, citizens, American citizens, and that if American citizens could get up and testify, there were so many of them that it would make a very big difference,” Giuliani said in his May deposition.\n\nThe theory that a state legislature could override the results of a state’s presidential vote is considered a fringe one, and Congress recently enacted statutory changes to limit legislatures’ ability to do so.\n\nAt one point, Giuliani said, “It seemed to me the courts didn’t want to be involved in a political question like this. And there was a kind of a discomfort too. Somehow we were trying to think, well, who would resolve something like this. And we started reading the Constitution.”\n\nGinni Thomas explains why she was ‘disgusted’ with Pence in text sent days after January 6\n\nVirginia “Ginni” Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, told the committee that when she said she was “disgusted” with then-Vice President Mike Pence in a text on January 10, 2021, she wasn’t referring to his refusal to stop the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s win, but rather to her frustration with him not talking up election fraud claims. There was no evidence of widespread election fraud in the election.\n\n“I was frustrated that I thought Vice President Pence might concede earlier than what President Trump was inclined to do,” Thomas said, according to a transcript released Friday. “And I wanted to hear Vice President Pence talk more about the fraud and irregularities in certain states that I thought was still lingering.”\n\n“I wasn’t focused on the Vice President’s role on January 6th,” she said, when asked specifically if the text – previously reported by CNN – was connected to how he handled that day.\n\nAt another point in the interview, committee member Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, asked Thomas what specific episodes of fraud concerned her.\n\n“I can’t say that I was familiar at that time with any specific evidence,” she said, pointing instead to what she heard from “friends on the ground” and “grassroots activists” who had “found things suspicious” at polling places.\n\n“I don’t know specific instances,” she said. “But certainly I think we all know that there are people questioning what happened in 2020, and it takes time to develop an understanding of the facts.”\n\nThe committee had only limited questions about Thomas’ interactions with her husband and his role on the Supreme Court – an area she would likely be able to decline to answer questions about, given the confidentiality allowed for married couples.\n\nHer husband had no idea she was texting Meadows, Thomas told the investigators.\n\n“He first learned of my text messaging with Mark Meadows in March when he was in the hospital and this committee released them,” she said in her interview.\n\nThomas said she regretted text messages sent to Mark Meadows after 2020 election\n\nGinni Thomas told the House select committee she regretted the text messages she was sending to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the election.\n\n“I regret the tone and content of these texts … I really find my language imprudent and my choices of sending the context of these emails unfortunate,” Thomas said.\n\nThomas’ mea culpa to the committee, captured in a transcript of her September interview that was released publicly Friday, marks a rare moment of public reflection from one of the more intriguing avenues the House panel pursued, after obtaining Meadows’ texts. Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, had been sending Meadows messages about challenging the election results. She explained to the committee at her interview she was concerned about a concession of the election before accusations of fraud were fully explored.\n\n“It was an emotional time. I was probably just emoting,” she said, in response to direct questions from committee member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. “Some of these are just things I was showing were moving through the movement and I’m regretting that they became public … Certainly I didn’t want my emotional texts to a friend released and made available.”\n\nAn attorney for Thomas said in a statement Friday that her “post-election activities” after Trump lost in 2020 were “minimal and mainstream.”\n\n“Her minimal activity was focused on ensuring that reports of fraud and irregularities were investigated,” attorney Mark Paoletta said in the statement. “Beyond that, she played no role in any events following the 2020 election. She also condemned the violence on January 6.”\n\nKey witness Tony Ornato tells committee he didn’t recall details, citing ‘fog of war’\n\nOne of the key witnesses in the House committee’s investigation, former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato, told the panel he couldn’t recall details from January 6, amid what he called “the fog of war” during the US Capitol attack.\n\nOrnato has been a central figure in the investigation since former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified that he relayed to her how the then-president angrily tried to redirect his motorcade to the Capitol that day – another detail that Ornato told the committee he didn’t recall.\n\nOrnato told the committee that most of his job on January 6 involved relaying information he received to then-chief of staff Meadows and said he couldn’t recall specific details when asked about who was trying to encourage Trump to send out a statement that day.\n\n“I’ll be honest with you, it was a very chaotic time in trying to get the information, and it was usually late information or it wasn’t accurate or it was the fog of war and it was misrepresented. And it was very – a very chaotic day, so I don’t recall those specific details,” Ornato said.\n\nDuring a public hearing in June, Hutchinson testified that Ornato told her Trump was angry he couldn’t go to the Capitol on January 6 after his speech at the Ellipse and that, during the ride back to the White House, he reached toward the front of the car to grab at the steering wheel.\n\nAccording to Ornato’s November testimony to the committee, which was released Friday, Ornato did not recall the conversation with Hutchinson and said he was “shocked” by her testimony.\n\n“I was called to put it on,” Ornato told the committee, referring to Hutchinson’s televised testimony, “and I was shocked and surprised of her testimony and called Mr. Engel and asked him, ‘What is she talking about?’”\n\nOrnato said that Robert Engel, the lead Secret Service agent in Trump’s motorcade on the day of the US Capitol attack, didn’t know what Hutchinson was referring to. Hutchinson testified that Ornato relayed the story about Trump’s outburst to her back at the White House, while Engel was in the room.\n\nThe committee makes clear in its final report it did not find Ornato’s testimony credible.\n\nTrump attorney questioned statistics on supposed dead voters in 2020 election\n\nAn attorney on Trump’s post-election legal team questioned some of the statistics being used to support claims of mass fraud, pointing out that many supposedly dead voters in Georgia likely sent in their ballots before they died, according to a January 6 committee transcript released Friday.\n\nThe committee read an email from the attorney, Katherine Friess, to Giuliani during the panel’s interview with him. In the email, Friess weighed in on a chart being prepared for Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican.\n\n“Many of the dead voters on the Georgia list sent their vote in before they passed. I don’t think this makes a particularly strong case, and I think it’s possible that Chairman Graham will push back on that,” Friess said in the email, according to the committee investigators who were questioning Giuliani.\n\nCNN previously reported that another Trump lawyer, Christina Bobb, told the committee that Graham promised to “champion” Trump’s election fraud claims, saying: “Just give me five dead voters.” And Georgia election officials told Trump they found two votes cast in the names of dead people, not 5,000 as the former president suggested.\n\nFriess said in her email that she was raising the issue so that everyone is aware of “what the data actually says.” Hundreds of names on the list were of people who had died after their ballot was received, according to the committee’s description of the chart.\n\nAn attorney who represented Friess in litigation she brought to block a committee subpoena of her phone records did not immediately respond to CNN’s inquiry about her email.\n\nTrump White House liaison denies she was banned from Justice Department\n\nA Trump administration official who was accused of trying to access sensitive Justice Department election-related information denied in testimony to the committee that she was barred from entering the DOJ’s building, as was reported at the time.\n\nHeidi Stirrup, who was working as the White House liaison to the DOJ during the 2020 election, said that her badge to enter in the building was deactivated briefly in November 2020, but that after a day or two it was reactivated and she was able to reenter the building.\n\nIn her deposition with the committee, Stirrup recounted conversations she had with then-Attorney General Bill Barr and another DOJ official when she was seeking information about what the department was doing to investigate voter fraud allegations after the 2020 election. She told congressional investigators that she “took it upon” herself to talk to the DOJ officials about how the department was approaching the allegations, after being asked by “friends” not in the federal government what was going on.\n\nStirrup told the committee that Will Levi, the other DOJ official she spoke to, shared with her a memo Barr sent to the department outlining the authority that US attorneys had to investigate allegations presented to them in their state. According to the transcript, Stirrup emailed that memo to various other Trump administration officials – including John Zadrozny and John McEntee, who both worked in the White House. She told the committee that she couldn’t recall having conversations with any of those individuals about DOJ’s investigations into the allegations, and said she shared with them the memo because she thought they would be interested in it.\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide said he hadn’t intended to be on ‘team crazy’\n\nRobert Sinners, who worked on the Trump campaign’s Election Day operations in Georgia in 2020 and helped organize the slate of alternate GOP electors there, told congressional investigators that his “intent was never to be aligned with team crazy.”\n\nSinners said he was assured that lawyers had signed off on the alternate elector plan and didn’t realize that numerous lawyers working with the Trump campaign had soured on the electors idea by the time the fake electors were convening on December 14, 2020, according to a transcript released Friday night.\n\nIn hindsight – after more fully understanding the extent of the schemes to overturn the 2020 election and the reservations some Trump attorneys had about these plots – Sinners told investigators he was both “ashamed” to have helped organize the fake electors and “angry.”\n\nCNN previously reported that Sinners emailed the fake electors asking for “complete secrecy and discretion” on December 13, 2020, a day before the GOP electors convened at the Georgia capitol. Sinners told the panel that efforts to ensure Georgia’s GOP electors met in secrecy had more to do with skirting Covid-19 restrictions and avoiding protesters than keeping the elector plan under wraps.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/07/22/1112324462/jan-6-hearing-takeaways', 'Headline': ""Trump didn't act and didn't want to, plus 4 other takeaways from Jan. 6 ..."", 'Snippet': ""House Jan. 6 committee hearings Jan. 6 panel sheds light on the 187 minutes Trump went dark during Capitol siege ... Donald Trump's conduct on Jan. 6 was a supreme violation of this oath of office ..."", 'Full_text': 'In the early evening of Jan. 6, after former President Donald Trump finally and reluctantly put out a video telling rioters to go home, after hours of staffers urging him to do so, he had only one thing to say.\n\n""Mike Pence let me down,"" Trump told a staffer of his vice president.\n\nThat was revealed during prime time on Thursday by Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., in the last of the first series of Jan. 6 committee hearings.\n\nJan. 6, 2021, was the worst attack on the U.S. Capitol since British soldiers burned it in 1814. People died. Members of Congress ran for their lives. Gallows were erected for Pence. Secret Service agents scrambled and said last goodbyes.\n\nAnd that was it — ""Mike Pence let me down.""\n\nThis was an attack that didn\'t come from outside; it came from within, from a mob of supporters of the defeated former president who pulled the wool over their eyes and convinced them — with lies — that it had all been stolen.\n\nThe committee, across these eight hearings, has built a case — more political than legal — that Trump, who continues to lie about the election and teases that he will run again in 2024, is not fit to hold the office.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the hearings thus far:\n\n1. Trump declined to tell rioters to go home for hours despite being urged to do so — and that had consequences.\n\nThe committee already laid out that Trump was aware there were many in the crowd who had weapons, but he wanted them to be allowed to bypass metal detectors and be allowed into his speech at the Ellipse. He somehow was confident they weren\'t there to hurt him.\n\nLikewise, he was aware that his supporters could become violent and was aware in real time that they were becoming violent. He watched on TV as it all went down. As things got worse, and staffer after staffer urged him to make a statement or put out a tweet that the crowd go home, he declined to do so until hours later.\n\nIn fact, when he finally did, when it happened to be clear that the insurrection would fail, he empathized with them.\n\nThat was the last straw for Sarah Matthews, a former deputy press secretary who testified Thursday.\n\n""He didn\'t distinguish between those who peacefully attended his speech and those we watched cause violence,"" Matthews said, adding, ""As a spokesperson, I knew I would be asked to defend that. His refusal to act and call off the mob that day, his refusal to condemn the violence was indefensible.""\n\nShe resigned that night.\n\nEven the next day, in outtakes of his videotaped speech to supporters, Trump was editing on the fly, and insisted: ""I don\'t want to say the election\'s over.""\n\nThe bottom line is Trump knew what was going on, and could have taken action, but chose not to, for hours. It was three hours and seven minutes from the end of his speech to when he finally put out the video telling the rioters to go home.\n\nAnd that had consequences — violence and damage to people and the building, but also to America\'s reputation around the world, testified Matthew Pottinger, a former deputy national security adviser in the Trump White House.\n\nJan. 6, he said, ""emboldened our enemies by helping give them ammunition to feed a narrative that our system of government doesn\'t work, that the United States is in decline.""\n\n2. A political argument more than a legal one.\n\nThe committee has made a strong case that Trump inspired Jan. 6. A number of those facing charges for their role that day have pointed the finger at the president, too.\n\nWhether there\'s any hard, prosecutable evidence of Trump\'s intent and coordination is less clear. It\'s been somewhat surprising how few firsthand conversations with Trump we\'ve heard about in these hearings with this many witnesses so close to the former president.\n\nBut Trump\'s criminal culpability, if any, is for the Department of Justice to determine.\n\nIt\'s becoming clearer after several of these hearings that the committee\'s goal is less legal and more political.\n\nTrump still won\'t acknowledge the truth that he lost the 2020 election. He\'s instead using his false grievance-filled election lies as fuel for a potential 2024 run. And that seems to be the key thing this committee is trying to prevent — Trump holding office again.\n\n""Every American must consider this,"" committee Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said, ""can a president who is willing to make the choices Donald Trump made during the violence of Jan. 6 ever be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again?""\n\nAre they convincing people? Perhaps, to a degree. The latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, out Thursday, found that hardcore partisans are pretty locked in — and Republicans are mostly not paying attention.\n\nBut it did also show that a majority of independents now blame Trump for what happened Jan. 6 (57%) and describe Jan. 6 as an insurrection and threat to democracy (52%). Both are up 9 points since last December. That\'s notable, given independents make up a good deal of the dwindling share of swing voters left in this country.\n\n3. It\'s hard to dismiss these witnesses.\n\nWe\'ve said it before, but we\'ll say it again, it gets harder and harder for Trump loyalists to dismiss these witnesses as Republicans in Name Only, or RINOs, with an ax to grind.\n\nThese have been people who worked for Trump\'s campaigns, his White House and voted for him. And there have been many of them.\n\nCheney attempted to reframe what\'s being said not as testimony but as a ""series of confessions"" from people close to the former president.\n\n""The case against Donald Trump in these hearings is not made by witnesses who were his political enemies,"" Cheney noted. ""It is instead a series of confessions by Donald Trump\'s own appointees, his own friends, his own campaign officials — his own family.""\n\nTrump has a history of turning up the pressure. Cheney has warned against potential witness intimidation, but it\'s been clear that no one has been immune from Trump\'s pressure campaigns — not his vice president, not Secret Service agents, not state officials or local election workers.\n\nHe\'s not even beyond manipulating his own supporters — for their time, action or money – as the committee has shown.\n\n4. For members of the committee, this has, at times, felt personal.\n\nOthers on the committee, though, seem eager to grind their axes. Those blades seem sharpest for members of their own party, and Kinzinger has often had his hand on the handle.\n\n""I\'m glad I\'m leaving here in a year, because I\'m just being surrounded by a bunch of children,"" Kinzinger said back in April. ""I hope my party can finally remember where our foundations are.""\n\nKinzinger, who is retiring at the end of his congressional term, has been ostracized by members of his own party — and family — and targeted by the former president. At times, he has channeled that anger into these hearings.\n\n""Whatever your politics,"" he said Thursday, ""whatever you think about the outcome of the election, we as Americans must all agree on this: Donald Trump\'s conduct on Jan. 6 was a supreme violation of this oath of office and a complete dereliction of his duty to our nation. It is a stain on our history, it is a dishonor to all those who have sacrificed and died in service to our democracy, when we present our full findings we will recommend changes to laws and policies to guard against another Jan. 6.""\n\nThis committee has revealed in prior sessions that a number of Republican colleagues have sought pardons.\n\nAnd then in Thursday\'s session, Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., highlighted a video of Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley running through the halls to evacuate, after previously raising a fist to the crowd in solidarity.\n\n""Think about what we\'ve seen,"" Luria said. ""Undeniable violence at the Capitol. The vice president being evacuated to safety by the Secret Service. Senators running through the hallways of the Senate to get away from the mob.""\n\nThen she tied it back to the larger point: ""As the commander in chief, President Trump was oath- and duty-bound to protect the Capitol. His senior staff understood that.""\n\n5. This is not the last hearing.\n\nCall it just the end of season one, because Cheney left us with this cliffhanger.\n\n""In the course of these hearings, we have received new evidence, and new witnesses have bravely stepped forward,"" she said, adding, ""Doors have opened. New subpoenas have been issued, and the dam has begun to break.""\n\nNetflix never turns seasons around that quickly.\n\n""We have considerably more to do. We have far more evidence to share with the American people and more to gather,"" Cheney said. ""So our committee will spend August pursuing emerging information on multiple fronts before convening further hearings this September.""\n\nThat means the committee\'s hearings will be getting closer to the November elections — something it originally wanted to steer clear of.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/22/us/politics/jan-6-committee-report.html', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Panel Issues Final Report, Placing Blame for Capitol Riot on ...', 'Snippet': 'The panel has already endorsed overhauling the Electoral Count Act, the law that Mr. Trump and his allies tried to exploit on Jan. 6 in an attempt to cling to power.

Trump had carried out what it called “a multipart plan to overturn the 2020 presidential election” and offering recommendations for steps to assure nothing like it could happen again.\n\nIt revealed new evidence about Mr. Trump’s conduct, and recommended that Congress consider whether to bar Mr. Trump and his allies from holding office in the future under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists.\n\n“The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, whom many others followed,” the report said. “None of the events of Jan. 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nThe release of the full report was the culmination of the panel’s 18-month inquiry and came three days after the committee voted to formally accuse Mr. Trump of inciting insurrection, conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an act of Congress and one other federal crime as it referred him to the Justice Department for potential prosecution. While the referrals do not compel federal prosecutors to take any action, they sent a powerful signal that a select committee of Congress believes the former president committed crimes.\n\n“Our institutions are only strong when those who hold office are faithful to our Constitution,” Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and the vice chairwoman of the committee, wrote in the report, adding: “Part of the tragedy of Jan. 6 is the conduct of those who knew that what happened was profoundly wrong, but nevertheless tried to downplay it, minimize it or defend those responsible.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Panel members now seem to be trying to lure Trump’s former White House counsel Pat ...', 'Full_text': ""The House Jan. 6 committee continued to hammer its main theme on Tuesday: Lacking a credible reason to overturn the election, Donald Trump and his allies sought to shame, bully and coerce state officials into manufacturing the victory the voters had denied him.\n\nBut in its latest hearing, the committee offered a new perspective. In his zeal to retain power, Trump and his allies trampled largely defenseless people who had the misfortune of getting in their way.\n\nIf not for the backbone they showed, Trump might have succeeded in subverting the nation’s democratic traditions.\n\nDefying Trump came at great personal cost. In emotional testimony, witnesses described the anguish they suffered from a Trump pressure campaign that has left them shaken to this day. Convinced that the election was stolen, Trump supporters demonized and threatened election officials and low-level workers who had merely tallied and reported accurate results.\n\nHere are the top takeaways from Tuesday’s hearing:\n\nTrump and company steamrolled innocent people to get a second term\n\nOne of the falsehoods peddled after the election was that election workers in Georgia had plucked fraudulent ballots from “suitcases,” giving Joe Biden the votes to win the state. The story was thoroughly debunked. Multiple recounts showed that Biden indeed won the state, while the “suitcases” were actually carriers that are routinely used in storing ballots.\n\nThe committee aired a clip of Rudy Giuliani, a former adviser to Trump, appearing before a Georgia legislative committee and alleging that a mother-daughter pair of election workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, had “surreptitiously” passed around USB devices “as if they’re vials of heroin or cocaine.”\n\nTrump mentioned them in the famous phone call in which he asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” the votes needed to defeat Biden. He called the mother, Freeman, a “professional vote scammer” and a “hustler.”\n\nIn testimony, Moss described how people came into her grandmother’s house looking to find her and her mother and trying to make a “citizen's arrest.”\n\n“I felt so helpless and horrible for her,” Moss recalled. “She was screaming. I told her to close the door and don’t open the door for anyone.”\n\nThe workers had done nothing wrong, as subsequent investigations showed. The USB device that Giuliani mentioned? Moss said her mother was handing her “a ginger mint.”\n\nAfter the hearing, committee members left the dais and one by one lined up to thank and hug Moss and Freeman.\n\nGiuliani appears again and again in the drive to overturn the results\n\nThe former New York City mayor played an outsize role in trying to keep Trump in office, as the hearings have revealed. Giuliani pressed Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers to convene a meeting of the state legislature to consider allegations of election fraud. Bowers was reluctant to do it, not wanting to be “a pawn” in the fight over the election, he testified. He repeatedly asked Giuliani and Trump for evidence that the election was stolen — of names of people who had voted illegally.\n\nHe described a meeting with Giuliani and one of his associates, Jenna Ellis, in which he asked them for proof of wrongdoing. Neither provided any. Giuliani, he said, told him: “We have lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”\n\nThe committee has the goods\n\nOne question before the hearings began was whether all the press leaks surrounding Jan. 6 would undercut the committee’s work. The committee faced a risk that viewers might tune out, feeling they’ve heard it all before. But the committee continues to present fresh testimony that deepens the public’s understanding of the attack on the Capitol.\n\nAt times, the new disclosures are small, but telling. In Tuesday’s hearing, the committee played snippets of Giuliani’s voicemail messages to state lawmakers asking them to return his calls and discuss the election. One official, Pennsylvania House Speaker Bryan Cutler, tried to get Giuliani to stop phoning. “I understand you don’t want to talk to me now, but I just want to bring some facts to your attention,” Giuliani said in one recording.\n\nMark Meadows, Trump’s fourth and final chief of staff, wanted to send memorabilia to Georgia state employees in an office that was auditing the election results, committee member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., disclosed at the hearing. Text messages showed that Meadows had wanted to send investigators in the office items that included autographed MAGA hats. White House staff prevented that from taking place.\n\nCommittee ups pressure on Trump former counsel Cipollone\n\nThe Jan. 6 panel has heaped praise on those Republicans who stood up to Trump and have testified publicly. Panel members now seem to be trying to lure Trump’s former White House counsel Pat Cipollone to join them at a hearing.\n\nAs she closed Tuesday’s session, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., called on Cipollone to reverse course and share his story before the committee.\n\n“Our evidence shows that Pat Cipollone and his office tried to do what was right. They tried to stop a number of President Trump’s plans for Jan. 6,” Cheney said. “We think the American people deserve to hear from Mr. Cipollone personally. He should appear before this committee, and we are working to secure his testimony.”\n\nCipollone and his deputy, Patrick Philbin, informally met with the committee in April. The panel wants Cipollone to testify publicly because he reportedly objected to Trump’s plan to fire acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, who supported the president’s bid for the Justice Department to pursue false claims of widespread voter fraud.\n\nBut it’s unclear if Cheney’s challenge will have any effect: A person close to Cipollone said, “Pat has been cooperative with the committee with President Trump’s permission, but there are serious institutional concerns and privilege issues and those have been recognized by the committee.”""}}",96.78571428571429,1

The venue’s general manager told the Orange County Register at the time it opted to cancel after learning Gaetz and Greene would be speaking.\n\nThe rally was moved to the Riverside Convention Center, but the city quickly started receiving complaints. Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers “are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.”\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue’s conditional use permit would be “in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.”\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a “peaceful protest against communism” outside Riverside City Hall.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/gop-reps-greene-and-gaetz-sue-anaheim-and-riverside-for-free-speech-rights/', 'Headline': 'GOP Reps.

Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene are suing two Southern California cities and several advocacy groups alleging they conspired to infringe on their free speech rights by pressuring venues to cancel a rally in 2021.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court on Thursday, alleges the venues caved to pressure from the cities of Anaheim and Riverside and canceled contracts for their America First rally because they disagreed with Greene and Gaetz politically. The two lawmakers are known for their strong support of former President Trump.\n\nThe lawsuit contends the 1st Amendment gives the lawmakers the freedom to use the venues ""on the same basis as other organizations and political figures without regard to their viewpoint or the viewpoint of speakers at their event.""\n\nA spokesman for the city of Riverside declined to comment on the lawsuit on Friday. Anaheim spokesman Mike Lyster said the city has ""not formally received the claim but are aware of it and will be reviewing.""\n\nThe lawsuit also names 10 advocacy or political organizations who allegedly pressured city officials and the venues to not host the rally.\n\nGaetz, Greene and their fundraising committees are seeking a declaration saying each of the defendants violated their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association as part of the lawsuit.\n\nThey are also asking for an injunction prohibiting the cities from denying or ""coercing private venues from entering into facilities use contracts with Plaintiffs for future political rallies"" and unspecified damages for emotional distress.\n\nAlexander Haberbush, an attorney representing Greene and Gaetz in the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nGreene, a Georgia congresswoman, and Gaetz, who represents much of the Florida Panhandle, tried to host their rally at two locations in Orange County and one in Riverside in July 2021, but the venues kept backing out.\n\nRead more: After third venue cancels, Gaetz, Greene take \'protest against communism\' to Riverside\n\nThe first location to fall through was the Pacific Hills Banquet & Event Center in Laguna Hills. The venue\'s general manager told the Orange County Register at the time it opted to cancel after learning Gaetz and Greene would be speaking.\n\nThe rally was moved to the Riverside Convention Center, but the city quickly started receiving complaints. Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers ""are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.""\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue\'s conditional use permit would be ""in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.""\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a ""peaceful protest against communism"" outside Riverside City Hall.\n\n“These folks they tried to cancel our venues but they can never cancel our patriotism or our American spirit,” Gaetz said in a video filmed outside Riverside City Hall. “They’ll hear us all throughout Southern California.”\n\nSign up for Essential California, your daily guide to news, views and life in the Golden State.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/reps-matt-gaetz-marjorie-taylor-211201122.html', 'Headline': ""Reps.

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida said on Thursday that they wish former President Donald Trump hadn\'t canceled a press conference originally scheduled for the anniversary of the January 6 insurrection.\n\nThe remarks came in response to a question by Insider at a press conference held by the two lawmakers, which they billed as a ""Republican response"" to the Capitol riot.\n\nInsider asked the duo why their arguments about the events of that day — including suggestions that there may have been a \'""fedsurrection"" orchestrated by elements within the FBI — should be trusted over those made by Trump himself. The former president, for his part, has asserted that the riots were simply a ""day of protesting the Fake Election"" and that the ""real insurrection happened on November 3rd.""\n\n""I don\'t think it\'s one or the other,"" Greene replied.\n\nThe congresswoman then went on to say that she and Gaetz disagreed with Trump\'s decision to cancel Thursday\'s press conference, which he was slated to hold at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\n""We were both really looking forward to President Trump\'s press conference tonight,"" Greene said. ""Unfortunately, I think he got some bad advice in canceling it. We wish that he had done that, so that people could\'ve asked him these questions.""\n\nWhen Trump announced his press conference, he also aired grievances about both January 6 and the 2020 election. ""Until then, remember, the insurrection took place on November 3rd, it was the completely unarmed protest of the rigged election that took place on January 6th,"" he said in a statement at the time.\n\nTrump called off the press conference on Tuesday, saying he would be talking about the subject at an Arizona rally on January 15 instead. Legal experts told Insider that it would\'ve been ""boneheaded"" to hold the event, given his ongoing legal woes.\n\nAt that same press conference, Gaetz and Greene condemned Sen. Ted Cruz for saying that the attacks last year constituted a ""terrorist attack.""\n\nAsked by Insider whether either of them had talked to Trump about their unproven theories about January 6, Gaetz demurred.\n\n""We don\'t talk about our conversations with the president with you guys under any circumstance,"" he said.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.ocregister.com/2023/07/14/gop-reps-marjorie-taylor-greene-matt-gaetz-are-suing-riverside-anaheim/', 'Headline': 'Anaheim is being sued by GOP Reps.

Marjorie Taylor Greene showed up at a protest across the street from the Manhattan criminal court where former President Donald Trump was being arraigned on Tuesday. The Georgia Republican spoke to a crowd through a megaphone and was met with both supporters and opponents.\n\nThe crowd was relatively small but swarmed Greene in the park across from the courthouse. She spoke briefly, calling Trump the ""top Republican candidate for president for 2024,"" and saying, ""We cannot tolerate this injustice in the United States of America. No more.""\n\nAs she condemned the actions of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who indicted Trump last week, and Democrats, the crowd got louder and louder, with some blowing whistles. Greene and her supporters chanted ""U-S-A"" as one person could be heard chanting ""go home"" at her.\n\nOthers shouted ""liar"" at Greene, a callback to when she shouted ""liar"" at President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address this year.\n\nTrump is the first former U.S. president ever to be indicted. A grand jury determined prosecutors had enough evidence to charge Trump, following an investigation related to ""hush money"" payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016.\n\nHe is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, and pleaded not guilty in court Tuesday.

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/us/politics/jan-6-video-pelosi-schumer-capitol.html', 'Headline': 'New Jan. 6 Video Shows Pelosi and Schumer Scrambling to Secure the ...', 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — Huddling with congressional leaders in a secure location as the Capitol was under siege on Jan. 6, 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was emphatic: There had to be a way to show the public ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Huddling with congressional leaders in a secure location as the Capitol was under siege on Jan. 6, 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was emphatic: There had to be a way to show the public that the government could function and the transfer of power could continue.\n\nShe asked: Was there a way to return to the Capitol and continue the ceremonial counting of electoral votes to certify the election that had been disrupted as a mob of President Donald J.

On that day -- and afterward -- we debunked false, misleading and unfounded claims ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/10/15/january-6-video-pelosi-schumer-capitol-security-ac360-vpx.cnn', 'Headline': 'New video shows Pelosi and Schumer talking with Army official on January 6', 'Snippet': 'New video from the January 6 insurrection shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) discussing security at the Capitol ahead of the vote to certify ...', 'Full_text': 'New video from the January 6 insurrection shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) discussing security at the Capitol ahead of the vote to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/pelosi-jan-6-capitol-riot-video/index.html', 'Headline': 'CNN Exclusive: New footage shows congressional leadership at Fort ...', 'Snippet': 'Never-before-seen footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command ...', 'Full_text': 'Never-before-seen footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command center, where they frantically coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump Cabinet members to quell the insurrection and finish certifying the 2020 election.\n\nThe January 6 select committee aired snippets of the footage at its public hearing on Thursday, but CNN has obtained roughly an hour of additional material that wasn’t presented by the panel.\n\nCongressional leaders contemplated, far more seriously than previously known, whether to reconvene the Electoral College proceedings at Fort McNair, the footage obtained by CNN reveals. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke with Pence about the “backup plan,” and officials tried to figure out how they’d transport hundreds of lawmakers to the Army base.\n\nThe extended raw footage shines a devastating light on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction during the riot. Lawmakers are seen working around Trump to secure any help they could get – from the National Guard, federal agencies and local police departments – to defeat the mob he incited.\n\nThe footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House. The filmmaker provided some of her behind-the-scenes footage to the January 6 select committee, which aired an edited compilation at Thursday’s hearing.\n\n“Everyone involved was working actively to stop the violence, to get federal law enforcement deployed to the scene to put down the violence and secure the Capitol complex,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said about the footage at the hearing. “All of them did what President Trump was not doing, what he simply refused to do.”\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe new clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nIn one dramatic scene, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer shouted at the Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, after hearing a rumor that Trump blocked the DC National Guard from rushing to the Capitol.\n\n“I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer said. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged. There is a picture of someone sitting in the chair of the Senate. We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nMcCarthy then assures Schumer that there was no stand-down order for the National Guard.\n\nAnd in another shocking moment, Schumer and Pelosi are seen chewing out the acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. In a heated phone call, Schumer told Rosen that federal authorities should “make arrests, starting now,” but Rosen only offered a halting, non-committal response.\n\n“Um, I have to defer to law enforcement on that,” Rosen replied.\n\n‘Don’t let anybody know where you are’\n\nMost of the raw footage shows Pelosi’s movements on January 6, and Alexandra Pelosi’s documentary crew provided CNN with timestamps for the videos. Perhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET. Pelosi asks Pence about his well-being and his physical safety, before discussing the possibility of resuming the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair, so lawmakers could complete the ceremonial process of finalizing Biden’s victory.\n\n“We’re at Fort McNair, which has facilities for the House and the Senate to meet, as a backup plan … should anything happen that would warrant that,” Pelosi says. “We’d rather go to the Capitol and do it there, but it doesn’t seem to be safe.”\n\nPelosi went on to tell Pence that she had been told it would take “days” for the Capitol to be secured, and thus, “we logistically want to bring all the members here, House and Senate.” But that never materialized: rank-and-file lawmakers and congressional staffers stayed inside the Capitol throughout the siege, with many barricading themselves in their offices.\n\n“I worry about you being in that Capitol room,” Pelosi tells Pence, who was holed up in a loading dock underneath the Capitol with his security detail. “Don’t let anybody know where you are.”\n\nPelosi tells the vice president that she heard reports of “defecation” on the House floor.\n\nThe House speaker says she consulted with then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about trying to “expedite” the GOP objections to President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral votes, so they could raise one objection and then “move forward” with the election certification. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, opposed the objections but several Trump-aligned GOP senators were still trying to nullify Biden’s victories in several key states.\n\nDuring the call, Pelosi unwraps a beef jerky stick and eats it, while holding the phone with her other hand.\n\n‘If he comes, I’m going to punch him out’\n\nEarlier in the previously unseen footage, on the morning of January 6, Pelosi participates in a video call with the House Democratic caucus to plan out the day’s proceedings. A devout Catholic, Pelosi invokes the Feast of the Epiphany, which is on January 6, and says she hoped that Republicans “would have their own epiphany” that day.\n\nThe call took place in Pelosi’s same conference room that was ransacked just a few hours later by riotous Trump supporters, some of whom specifically said they wanted to hunt her down.\n\nPelosi is later seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nThen, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this. But the footage backs up the testimony of Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump’s attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: “If he comes, I’m going to punch him out. I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\n‘We have got to finish the proceedings’\n\nAs Pelosi exits her office and heads to the House chamber, the footage shows congressional aides carrying the all-important boxes containing the official Electoral College certificates. The proceedings begin, with Pence presiding, and GOP lawmakers quickly file their first objection.\n\nThrongs of Trump supporters soon started swarming the Capitol complex. The shaky video footage shows Pelosi and her entourage of staff and family members getting whisked away from the building, escaping the fast-approaching rioters and descending down a narrow staircase\n\n“If they stop the proceedings, we will have totally failed,” Pelosi says, as she evacuated the Capitol, adding later, “We have got to finish the proceedings, or else they will have a complete victory.”\n\nOn her way out, she asks aides if they were able to reach McConnell, and whether he was on board to jointly request emergency assistance from the National Guard. (He was, they said.)\n\nResettled at Fort McNair, Pelosi learns that some House members were trapped in the chamber and were instructed by security officials to put on their government-issued gas masks. Pelosi and her colleagues later watch the riot unfolding on CNN, the footage shows. They were visibly shaken by the TV coverage.\n\n‘One hell of a hurry’\n\nThe extended footage obtained by CNN shows congressional leaders from both parties taking refuge at Fort McNair.\n\nDemocratic leaders Pelosi and Schumer, as well as top-ranking Reps. Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn, are seen throughout the raw footage. They were joined by top Republicans, like McConnell, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Sen John Thune of South Dakota and Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, is also in the footage, taking refuge at Fort McNair. His presence is notable considering his trajectory after the insurrection: McCarthy confronted Trump in a heated call during the attack, and directly blamed Trump in the immediate aftermath, but days later re-embraced Trump and began downplaying the riot.\n\nOne scene from the footage, around 3:18 p.m. ET, shows some of the senior Democratic officials talking again with Ryan McCarthy, the Army secretary. Schumer was apparently under the impression that the military response was impeded.\n\n“I never said no,” Ryan McCarthy says, about activating the National Guard. “I just had to get permission.” Without naming any names, Ryan McCarthy then tells the lawmakers that he “had to talk to my boss.” It’s not clear who the Army leader was referring to, but acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller was technically his boss.\n\nMiller did not speak with Trump on January 6, according to the House select committee investigating the attack. Miller did speak that day with Pence, who took on an impromptu leadership role that day, working with congressional leaders and Capitol security officials, and the footage clearly shows Pence coordinating with Pelosi about the efforts to secure the Capitol.\n\nRoughly 30 minutes later, approximately 10 lawmakers huddle around a phone in a bipartisan scrum to speak with Miller, the acting Defense secretary. Schumer presses Miller on the slow National Guard response, and informed Miller that some senators were trapped in their hideaway offices near the breached Senate chamber.\n\nMcConnell tells Miller that troops need to be “getting there in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\n“This is an emergency,” Schumer says, “where life and limb are at stake.”\n\nThe acting Pentagon chief tells the lawmakers that he got the message “loud and clear,” the troops had already been activated, and that plans to retake the Capitol were being devised by military leaders.\n\n‘Answer my question!’\n\nThe clips show Pelosi speaking with then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, about sending troops, because he could directly activate the Virginia National Guard without presidential involvement. She additionally spoke with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, another Democrat, whose police department was on the frontlines that day.\n\nThere was also the showdown with Rosen, the acting attorney general. Schumer yells into his flip phone, castigating Rosen, and urges him to tell Trump to call off the mob. Rosen had little to offer Schumer, except to say he was mobilizing federal agents under his purview. Pelosi tells Rosen that the rioters were “breaking the law … at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nRosen says his team was “coordinating as quickly and as–” before getting cut off by Schumer, who forcefully asks Rosen again if he will intervene directly with Trump.\n\n“No, no, no – please answer my question,” Schumer shouts. “Answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\n“Mr. President, you’re right that I’m not going to allow the Justice Department to do anything to try to overturn the election,” Rosen told Trump during that high-stakes Oval Office meeting on January 3, 2021, according to his testimony to the January 6 committee.\n\n‘Continue democracy here on base’\n\nAs late as 4:30 p.m. ET, top congressional leaders were talking with McCarthy, the Army secretary, about completing the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair.\n\n“We must finish,” Schumer said, “but you have to help us make that decision.”\n\nSchumer and others later discuss the logistics of shuttling hundreds of lawmakers to Fort McNair. Pelosi wonders aloud if there were microphones they could use. Officials tried to resolve the big questions: How would lawmakers get bussed from the Capitol to Fort McNair? Where would they go after certification is completed? How would they get home safely?\n\nIn what looked like an impromptu briefing, a US Capitol Police officer provides some logistical answers to the senior lawmakers, for how they could “continue democracy here on base.”\n\nBut the congressional leaders were also wary, and Schumer said the Fort McNair backup plan would look like “we’re abandoning the Capitol to insurrectionists.”\n\nBy the evening, police had expelled most of the rioters and started establishing a secure perimeter around the Capitol. Pelosi gets on the phone again with Pence around 6 p.m. ET, and the vice president had some good news for the congressional leaders, who were hoping to get back into the Capitol.\n\n“I am literally standing with the chief of the US Capitol Police,” Pence said on speakerphone, as Pelosi, Schumer and Grassley listened. “And he just informed me, that their best information is that they believe that the House and the Senate will be able to reconvene in roughly an hour.”\n\nWith that, the Fort McNair “backup plan” was called off.\n\n‘There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby’\n\nSoon after, Pelosi speaks with then-House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving. In the previously undisclosed conversation, Irving confirms that lawmakers can soon return, but some areas will be off-limits, because they are a “crime scene.”\n\n“There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby,” Irving says, referring to the area immediately off the House floor where Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a police officer.\n\nThe footage shows Pelosi leaving Fort McNair and driving through the dark streets of DC toward the Capitol. The Senate reconvened around 8 p.m. ET and the House reconvened around 9 p.m. ET.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump’s staunchest congressional allies pushed ahead with their challenges against Biden’s electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their objections, based on meritless claims of fraud, were defeated in bipartisan votes. The 2020 election formally came to a close.\n\nThe new footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, who has released documentaries on HBO for decades.

Startled, Pelosi asked the woman to repeat what she said.\n\n""Do you believe this?"" Pelosi said in disbelief to another Democratic leader, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.\n\nIt was around 2:45 p.m. and the violent cacophony had already disrupted the planned certification of the 2020 presidential election results. It would be hours before the building was secure.\n\nNever-before-seen video footage played Thursday by the House Jan. 6 committee showed Pelosi and other leaders, including Republican allies of President Donald Trump, responding anxiously -- and angrily -- to the insurrection.\n\nThe recordings offer a rare glimpse into the real-time reactions of the most powerful members of Congress as they scrambled to drum up support from all parts of the government, including from agencies seemingly ill prepared for the chaos, and vented anger over a president whose conduct they felt had endangered their lives.\n\nIn the videos, Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer negotiate with governors and defense officials to try to get the National Guard to the Capitol as police were being brutally beaten outside the building.\n\nThe deployment of the Guard was delayed for hours as Trump stood by and did little to stop the violence of his supporters.\n\nThe footage, recorded by Pelosi\'s daughter, Alexandra, a documentary filmmaker, was shown during the committee\'s 10th hearing as an illustration of the president\'s inaction in the face of grave danger posed by the rioters to the lawmakers forced into hiding inside.\n\n""As the president watched the bloody attack unfold on Fox News from his dining room, members of Congress and other government officials stepped into the gigantic leadership void created by the president\'s chilling and steady passivity that day,"" said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a committee member.\n\nThe concerns were not theoretical. Around 3 p.m., as a Trump loyalist outside Pelosi\'s office pointed her finger and shouted, ""We\'re coming in if you don\'t bring her out,"" the speaker was huddled somewhere else in a room with Schumer, who said, ""I\'m gonna call up the effin\' secretary of DoD.""\n\nAnd so he did, telling acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller on speakerphone that there were senators still in hideaway spaces and imploring him to send in the Maryland National Guard. Pelosi chimed in that she was going to call the mayor of Washington, D.C., for help as well.\n\nAs the violence persisted outside -- ""Officer down, get him up,"" a voice could be heard bellowing in one clip shown by the committee -- the leaders kept making calls inside. One went to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam about the possibility of help from the Virginia National Guard, with Pelosi narrating the events based on what she saw from television news footage.\n\nAn angrier call followed with Jeffrey Rosen, the then-acting attorney general. Days earlier, and unbeknownst at the time to Congress or to the public, Rosen and colleagues had fended off a slapdash attempt by Trump to replace him with a subordinate eager to challenge the election results.\n\nOn that day, though, Schumer and Pelosi sat shoulder-to-shoulder on the couch and laid bare their frustrations with the country\'s top law enforcement official.\n\n""They\'re breaking the law in many different ways,"" Pelosi said. ""And quite frankly, much of it at the instigation of the president of the United States.""\n\nSchumer weighed in too, shaking his head to the side for emphasis: ""Yeah, why don\'t you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility? A public statement they should all leave.""\n\nIt wasn\'t until the evening that the Capitol would be cleared and work would resume. The news that Congress would be able to reconvene to finish its work in certifying the election results was delivered to the congressional leaders not by Trump but by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nAfter a very bad day, Schumer had two words: ""Good news.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/house-jan-6-committee-hearings-summary/', 'Headline': ""What we've learned from the House Jan. 6 committee hearings - CBS News"", 'Snippet': 'Pelosi, Schumer and others ""stepped into the giant leadership void"" on Jan. 6 14:07.

The information ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Transcripts of interviews with law enforcement officials released this week by the Jan. 6 committee reveal the panel learned that numerous security concerns had been raised in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMany of the revelations came in interviews with high-ranking individuals such as former Secret Service and White House official Anthony Ornato; former executive director of the National Capitol Threat Intelligence Center Donell Harvin; former Deputy FBI Director David Bowdich; Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee; former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund; and House Staff Director Jamie Fleet.\n\nBut some of the new information came from questions posed to those officials by Jan. 6 committee staffers based on details they had gathered in the course of the 18-month investigation.\n\nMuch of that information, mentioned by investigators during the interviews, was not included in the appendix of the committee\'s final report that addressed law enforcement and intelligence failures. For the most part, Jan. 6 committee leaders decided against focusing the final report on how law enforcement came to be so underprepared for the attack.\n\nThe new revelations add to a growing body of evidence from news reports and court proceedings that illustrate how federal law enforcement officials were in possession of ample information that indicated Jan. 6 was going to be violent. As NBC News first reported last month, staffers were informed that chapters prepared by committee staff — including material focused on law enforcement and intelligence failures — would be cut from the final version.\n\nAmong the revelations from the transcripts: One FBI employee wrote in a Dec. 26, 2020, memo about planning for Jan. 6 that was unfolding on a pro-Trump forum called TheDonald.\n\n“They think they will have a large enough group to march into DC armed, and it will outnumber the police so they can’t be stopped,"" read the notification in the eGuardian system, which is meant to help federal, state and local law enforcement officials coordinate. ""They believe that since the election was stolen, that it’s their constitutional right to over take the government and during this coup no U.S. laws apply. Another group of Proud Boys will be in DC already and are planning on blocking the roads with their cars in order to stop traffic.""\n\nNBC News previously reported that one of the FBI’s own confidential sources informed the bureau on the day that Trump sent his Dec. 19, 2020, “will be wild” tweet about Jan. 6 that far-right groups saw it as a “call to arms.” The FBI received numerous tips about the potential for violence on Jan. 6, including from the son of a Texas man who ultimately came to the Capitol with a gun, and the bureau briefed other law enforcement entities about threats, including intelligence that suggested the Oath Keepers had set up armed ""quick reaction forces"" in Virginia that were set to come into D.C. at Trump\'s command. Two members of the Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy at a trial that ended last month, and three others pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee transcripts detailed the challenges facing the FBI in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Days before the attack, the FBI lost use of the program it had been using to track threats on social media, as the bureau transitioned to a new product to gather open source information. An FBI intelligence analyst raised concerns about that on New Year\'s Eve, as threats about Jan. 6 continued to increase.\n\n“We have an urgent need for the DataMinr replacement to be on and active starting on January 4th in support of some potential issues in the D.C. area,” the analyst wrote in a Dec. 31, 2020, email. “The sudden discontinuation is most untimely as much of our crisis response funnels through DataMinr.”\n\nBowdich, in his interview with Jan. 6 investigators, said there was a lot happening at the bureau in the days before the attack: There had been a major cyber intrusion; a bomb had gone off in downtown Nashville, Tenn.; the first anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani was approaching; and the bureau was receiving a lot of intelligence about the potential for violence, much of which was publicly available on social media.\n\n“I wish you could see the volume,” Bowdich told the committee, referring to the number of threats the FBI reviews. “It is off the charts. ... One of our greatest challenges is social media today.”\n\nThe bureau did make efforts to try to disrupt extremists\' travel to D.C.; the FBI\'s Domestic Terrorism Operations Section messaged all domestic terrorism assistant special agents in charge across the country to determine whether any of the extremists they were watching were planning to go to D.C. on Jan. 6.\n\nUltimately, the FBI set up a national command post for the event inside the Strategic Information Operations Center at FBI headquarters in Washington.\n\n“The noise seemed to be growing as we got closer to the event, and it reached a point of we just didn’t know what was going to happen,"" Bowdich said. ""Sometimes you just get a sense for it when you’ve been doing it.”\n\nSome of those officials interviewed by the committee about the intelligence failures made clear they thought there were problems that needed to be fixed, both before Jan. 6 and going forward.\n\n“[Y]ou don’t need intelligence. I mean, everybody knew that people were directed to come there by the President. November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, who was head of the D.C. National Guard on Jan. 6. The information publicly available made clear that Jan. 6 “was going to be a big deal,” he said.\n\nSund, the former Capitol Police chief who resigned the day after the attack, said that intelligence he received didn\'t ""send up a bunch of red flags for me"" because most protests target Congress. Harvin, the former chief of homeland security and intelligence for D.C., told the committee that Sund shouldn\'t characterize what happened as an intelligence failure, but as a failure to act on intelligence.\n\n“He said it was intelligence failure,"" Harvin said. ""It may have been an intelligence failure on his agency’s part and a failure to properly contextualize and pervade the threat environment, but it wasn’t an intelligence failure at large.”\n\nContee, the D.C. police chief, said there needed to be better sharing of intelligence, and that he would have liked to have known about a Capitol Police report about some of the threats related to Jan. 6.\n\n“I don’t think I want to get notified about Armageddon through an email,"" Contee said. ""That would not be my preferred notification, right?”\n\nWhen asked about what she thought the intelligence failures were, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was blunt.\n\n""People didn\'t think that these white nationalists would overthrow the Capitol building,"" the Democratic mayor said.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-committee-shows-video-footage-congressional-leaders-pleading-hel-rcna52170', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 committee shows video footage of congressional leaders pleading ...', 'Snippet': 'The video montage began with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., walking through the Capitol flanked by security guards at 2:23 p.m. ET after the Capitol was breached.', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection presented previously unseen video Thursday of congressional leaders pleading for help from governors, the acting secretary of defense and the acting attorney general as rioters attacked the Capitol.\n\nThe video montage began with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., walking through the Capitol flanked by security guards at 2:23 p.m. ET after the Capitol was breached.

""Do you believe this?"" Pelosi said to Clyburn.\n\nThe next clip showed a crowd of Trump supporters outside what appeared to be Pelosi\'s leadership office near the House floor. ""We\'re coming in if you don\'t bring her out!"" one woman yelled.\n\n""I\'m going to call up the effing secretary of DoD,"" then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, referring to the Department of Defense, while sitting next to Pelosi in another undisclosed room at 3 p.m. The two Democrats were seen calling then-Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller on Schumer\'s flip phone, requesting a ""massive"" response.\n\nThe video also showed Pelosi speaking to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam in which she wondered if he could deploy his state\'s National Guard troops to the Capitol. She told Northam that House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was making the same request of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. Schumer and Pelosi were also seen on the phone with Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen asking for him to get President Donald Trump to call off his supporters.\n\n""Why don’t you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility — a public statement they should all leave?"" Schumer said.\n\nOne of the central questions lingering after the attack was why it took so long for National Guard troops to provide the overwhelmed Capitol Police officers with backup. Trump and his allies have repeatedly blamed Pelosi, with Trump telling The Washington Post in April, ""I thought it was a shame, and I kept asking why isn’t she doing something about it? Why isn’t Nancy Pelosi doing something about it? And the mayor of D.C. also. The mayor of D.C. and Nancy Pelosi are in charge.""\n\nThe video from Thursday\'s hearing shows Pelosi and other congressional leaders repeatedly asking for help from law enforcement.\n\nEventually, the video showed Pelosi and Schumer in a room with GOP congressional leaders at the time: Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., then the majority leader; House GOP Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.; and Senate GOP Whip John Thune, R-S.D.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate Democratic whip, appeared in another clip with leaders.\n\nAt 4:22 p.m., Pelosi was on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who was in a separate secure location. She told Pence that they had spoken to McConnell about expediting the process of certifying the 2020 electoral votes.\n\n""What we are being told very directly is it’s going to take days for the Capitol to be OK again,"" Pelosi told Pence. ""We’ve gotten a very bad report about the condition of the House floor. There’s defecation and all that kind of thing. I don’t think that’s hard to clean up, but I do think it’s more from a security standpoint making sure everybody is out of the building and how long will that take.""\n\nAt 5:59 p.m., Pence spoke with Pelosi and Schumer on the phone and said he was standing with the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police who had just told him that congressional leaders would hear through official channels that the House and Senate would be able to reconvene ""in roughly an hour.""\n\n""Good news,"" Schumer and Pelosi both said.\n\nMembers were seen returning to the Capitol at 7:13 p.m. to finish the process of certifying the 2020 election results.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/14/politics/new-video-clips-january-6-attack/index.html', 'Headline': 'Watch: Key moments from new January 6 video | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is seen in the new footage from January 6. 2021. From Alexandra Pelosi/HBO CNN is airing more exclusive footage at 8 p.m. ET on “Anderson Cooper 360”.', 'Full_text': 'CNN is airing more exclusive footage at 8 p.m. ET on “Anderson Cooper 360”.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has held a series of public hearings in an effort to shed new light on the events of that day and how former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election incited a mob of his supporters to violence.\n\nThe hearings have featured a wide array of information gathered during the investigation that has taken the form of taped clips of interviews conducted by the panel, live testimony from witnesses, and documentary materials.\n\nDuring a hearing on Thursday, which culminated in a vote to subpoena Trump, the committee showed previously unseen footage of congressional leaders on January 6 sheltering and attempting to have federal law enforcement deployed to counter the attack.\n\nCNN obtained roughly an hour of additional material that wasn’t presented by the panel. The footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command center, where they frantically coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump Cabinet members to quell the insurrection and finish certifying the 2020 election. The footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House.\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the new footage:\n\nSchumer pleads with acting AG to ask Trump to call off rioters\n\nThis clip shows a tense conversation between then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen where Schumer asks Rosen to tell Trump to tell the rioters to leave the Capitol.\n\n“Will you ask the President to make a statement to ask them to leave the Capitol?,” Schumer says. Rosen sidesteps the question, saying instead, “So, uh, as you might guess we’re coordinating as quickly and as” – at which point Schumer jumps in to say, “no, no, no, please answer my question,” before shouting, “answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\nAt the start of the clip, Schumer can be seent shouting at the then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\n“DC has requested the National Guard and it’s been denied by DOD. I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer says. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged … We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nSchumer then hangs up the phone and tells Pelosi who is sitting nearby, “They have not denied it. I spoke to the Secretary of the Army. He’s given the full OK to (inaudible) the National Guard. He said it was not denied.”\n\nPelosi talks about punching Trump\n\nPelosi can be seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nLater, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this. But the footage backs up the testimony of Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump’s attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: “If he comes, I’m going to punch him out. I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\nLater in the clip, Pelosi can be seen saying “we have got to finish the proceedings or else they will have a complete victory,” a reference to how lawmakers wanted to finish certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election and Joe Biden’s win after the pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol.\n\nPence works to relay information to Hill leaders\n\nThis clip shows Pelosi on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who says he is at the Capitol building. Pence gives Pelosi and Schumer a heads up that law enforcement officials believe the House and Senate will be able to reconvene in “roughly an hour.”\n\nThe video demonstrates how Pence worked to relay information to congressional leaders on the day of the attack. When Schumer hears what Pence has to say, he responds emphatically by saying, “Good news!”\n\n“They have thousands of law enforcement on the campus and they’re confident they can secure the campus for reconvening so, I hope that’s helpful,” Pence says. Pelosi thanks him afterward.\n\nThis clip shows in lengthy detail how the situation at the Capitol escalated on January 6 with rioters swarming the building and eventually breaching it. It shows rioters screaming obscenities directed at a variety of people including law enforcement officers, Pelosi and Pence.\n\nLater Pelosi is seen sheltering with Schumer and other congressional leaders. They pass a phone around with photos of the scene unfolding at the Capitol. “Oh my God. They broke into the Senate chamber,” Schumer says.\n\nA television is turned on showing footage of the attack. “Oh my God, they’re just breaking windows,” Pelosi says, reacting to what she sees on the screen. “It’s just horrendous. All at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nLater, a group of bipartisan congressional leaders huddle around a phone to speak with Christopher Miller, the acting Defense secretary.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has message of urgency for Miller, saying, “we’re in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\nMiller responds that he got the message, “loud and clear.”\n\nPelosi is later seen speaking with Pence on the phone. She asks him how he’s doing and expresses concern for his safety. “Don’t let anybody know where you are,” she warns.\n\nPelosi, Pence discuss personal safety, contingency plans\n\nPerhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET. Pelosi asks Pence about his well-being and his physical safety, before discussing the possibility of resuming the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair, so lawmakers could complete the ceremonial process of finalizing Biden’s victory.\n\n“I worry about you being in that Capitol room,” Pelosi tells Pence, who was holed up in a loading dock underneath the Capitol with his security detail. “Don’t let anybody know where you are.”\n\nPelosi, Schumer talk with Army secretary\n\nAs late as 4:30 p.m. ET, top congressional leaders were talking with McCarthy, the Army secretary, about completing the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair.\n\n“We must finish,” Schumer said, “but you have to help us make that decision.”\n\nSchumer and others later discuss the logistics of shuttling hundreds of lawmakers to Fort McNair. Pelosi wonders aloud if there were microphones they could use. Officials tried to resolve the big questions: How would lawmakers get bused from the Capitol to Fort McNair? Where would they go after certification is completed? How would they get home safely?\n\nBut the congressional leaders were also wary, and Schumer said the Fort McNair backup plan would look like “we’re abandoning the Capitol to insurrectionists.”'}}",95.71428571428571,1

A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Ghost guns Biden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/61075086', 'Headline': ""Biden sets rule banning sale of untraceable DIY 'ghost gun' kits - BBC"", 'Snippet': 'US President Joe Biden\'s administration has finalised a set of new regulations targeting untraceable ""ghost guns"".

Background checks have not previously been required to purchase the assembly kits.\n\nThe new rules require self-assembled ""buy build shoot"" kits to have serial numbers - legally making them a firearm.\n\n""You buy a couch [that] you have to assemble, it\'s still a couch,"" said Mr Biden said in his news conference.\n\n""You buy the parts you need to build a functioning firearm, it\'s still a gun.""\n\nIt also forces federally licensed firearm dealers to add serial numbers to any untraceable guns purchased through them.\n\nExperts say that a fraction of violent crimes are being committed with ghost guns, but law enforcement authorities say they are being recovered more frequently at crime scenes.\n\nIn 2021, there were about 20,000 suspected ghost guns recovered by police and reported to the ATF - a tenfold increase from 2016, according to the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, the firearms business has seen record sales since the early days of the pandemic two years ago. In 2020, a record of about 22m guns were legally sold. Almost 19m guns were bought in 2021.\n\nAlso on Monday, Mr Biden announced a new nominee for the ATF after his first choice failed to advance through the Senate confirmation process because of Republican opposition.\n\nIf confirmed, former US attorney for Ohio Steve Dettlebach will be the first to hold the office since 2013.\n\nA bullseye for Biden or a misfire?\n\nGun control is an issue Democrats in Washington always talk about but seldom are able to do much about. Part of this is the reality of congressional gridlock, which allows Republicans in the US Senate to block any substantive legislation on the topic. There is also a fear among Democrats that guns are an electoral liability. They worry that firearm-rights activists are more likely to punish them for new legislation than gun-control proponents are to reward them.\n\nAnd so Democratic-backed changes, at least on the national level, are made on the margins. Such is the case with the administration move to regulate ghost guns, which at the moment play a relatively small part in the rise of US gun violence.\n\nIt is an area, however, where the Biden administration can act on its own, without congressional support. The president can tout an accomplishment that may placate supporters concerned that gun control has languished on the back-burner during the first half of his presidency.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/us/supreme-court-biden-ghost-guns.html', 'Headline': 'By 5-4 Vote, Supreme Court Revives Biden’s Regulation of ‘Ghost Guns’', 'Snippet': 'The Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily revived the Biden administration’s regulation of “ghost guns” — kits that can be bought online and assembled into untraceable homemade firearms ...', 'Full_text': 'The Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily revived the Biden administration’s regulation of “ghost guns” — kits that can be bought online and assembled into untraceable homemade firearms.\n\nIn defending the rule, a key part of President Biden’s broader effort to address gun violence, administration officials said such weapons had soared in popularity in recent years, particularly among criminals barred from buying ordinary guns.\n\nThe court’s brief order gave no reasons, which is typical when the justices act on emergency applications. The order was provisional, leaving the regulation in place while a challenge moves forward in the courts.\n\nThe vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the court’s three liberal members — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — to form a majority.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh noted dissents. Like the justices in the majority, they did not explain their reasoning.\n\nThe regulation, issued in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, broadened the bureau’s interpretation of the definition of “firearm” in the Gun Control Act of 1968.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Today, the President is nominating Steve Dettelbach to serve as Director of ATF.\n\nDettelbach is a highly respected former U.S. Attorney and career prosecutor who spent over two decades as a prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice. He has received bipartisan praise and support from law enforcement for his work. In 2009, he was unanimously confirmed for his position as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. He has a proven track record of working with federal, state, and local law enforcement to fight violent crime and combat domestic violent extremism and religious violence – including through partnerships with the ATF to prosecute complex cases and take down violent criminal gangs. Dettelbach also worked closely with local law enforcement and community leaders to develop and implement data-driven and neighborhood-based efforts to prevent and fight violent crime. His leadership and his record of innovation in fighting crime and violence make him ready from day one to aggressively and creatively address these pressing issues at the Director of ATF.\n\nCracking down on ghost guns – the weapon of choice for many violent criminals\n\nToday, the President and Deputy Attorney General will also announce that the U.S. Department of Justice has issued a final rule to rein in the proliferation of “ghost guns” – unserialized, privately-made firearms that law enforcement are increasingly recovering at crime scenes in cities across the country. Last year alone, there were approximately 20,000 suspected ghost guns reported to ATF as having been recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations – a ten-fold increase from 2016.[1] Because ghost guns lack the serial numbers marked on other firearms, law enforcement has an exceedingly difficult time tracing a ghost gun found at a crime scene back to an individual purchaser.\n\nThis final rule bans the business of manufacturing the most accessible ghost guns, such as unserialized “buy build shoot” kits that individuals can buy online or at a store without a background check and can readily assemble into a working firearm in as little as 30 minutes with equipment they have at home. This rule clarifies that these kits qualify as “firearms” under the Gun Control Act, and that commercial manufacturers of such kits must therefore become licensed and include serial numbers on the kits’ frame or receiver, and commercial sellers of these kits must become federally licensed and run background checks prior to a sale – just like they have to do with other commercially-made firearms.\n\nThe final rule will also help turn some ghost guns already in circulation into serialized firearms. Through this rule, the Justice Department is requiring federally licensed dealers and gunsmiths taking any unserialized firearm into inventory to serialize that weapon. For example, if an individual builds a firearm at home and then sells it to a pawn broker or another federally licensed dealer, that dealer must put a serial number on the weapon before selling it to a customer. This requirement will apply regardless of how the firearm was made, meaning it includes ghost guns made from individual parts, kits, or by 3D-printers.\n\nThis rule builds on the Biden Administration’s prior executive action to rein in the proliferation of ghost guns. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice launched a National Ghost Gun Enforcement Initiative, which is training a national cadre of prosecutors and disseminating investigation and prosecution tool to help bring cases against those who use ghost guns to commit crimes. As President Biden said during an event at the New York Police Department headquarters, if you use a ghost gun to commit a crime “not only are state and local prosecutors going to come after you, but expect federal charges and federal prosecution as well.”\n\nAdditional executive action to reduce gun violence\n\nToday’s final rule includes two additional actions to make our communities safer.\n\nFirst, the final rule ensures that firearms with split receivers are subject to regulations requiring serial numbers and background checks when purchased from a licensed dealer, manufacturer or importer. Decades ago, ATF issued a regulation defining the “frame or receiver” of a firearm as the part that is regulated by the Gun Control Act – meaning that is the part that triggers federal serialization, background check, and other requirements. At that time, many firearms in the United States were single-framed firearms, like revolvers, that house key components in a single structure. However, we have seen the increasing popularity of firearms using split or multi-part receivers that house key components in multiple structures. Some courts have recently interpreted decades-old regulatory text in a way that, if broadly applied, could mean that as many as 90 percent of firearms in the United States today would not have a frame or receiver subject to federal regulation. The final rule updates the regulatory definitions of “frame” and “receiver” to ensure that firearms using split or multi-part receivers continue to be covered by our common-sense gun laws.\n\nSecond, the final rule requires federally licensed firearms dealers to retain key records until they shut down their business or licensed activity. At that time, these dealers must transfer the records to ATF, just as they are currently required to do at the end of licensed activity. Previously, these dealers were permitted to destroy most records after 20 years, making it harder for law enforcement to trace firearms found at crime scenes. According to ATF’s National Tracing Center, on average more than 1,300 firearms a year are untraceable because the federally licensed firearms dealer destroyed the relevant records that were more than 20 years old.\n\nImplementing the President’s comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy\n\nThis final rule is part of the President’s comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy. President Biden made more progress on executive actions to reduce gun violence than any other President during their first year in office. You can read more about the Administration’s whole-of-government approach to reduce gun crime here.\n\nPresident Biden’s fiscal year 2023 budget calls on Congress to deliver the funding needed to implement the President’s comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crime and make our communities safer. These additional resources will fund accountable policing, including by putting more police officers on the beat, and making essential investments in crime prevention and community violence intervention.\n\nCongress needs to do its job by passing this budget and other essential legislation to reduce gun crime, including legislation to require background checks for all gun sales, ensure that no terrorist can buy a weapon in the United States, ban the sale and possession of unserialized firearms — ghost guns, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and repeal gun manufacturers’ protection from liability.\n\n###'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/06/qa-on-bidens-gun-proposals/', 'Headline': ""Q&A on Biden's Gun Proposals - FactCheck.org"", 'Snippet': 'Over that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.', 'Full_text': 'In a prime-time speech to the nation, President Joe Biden spoke about gun violence and his proposals to reduce it. Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-administration-proposes-eliminating-gun-show-loophole-regulation-rcna102800', 'Headline': ""Biden administration proposes regulation to eliminate 'gun show loophole'"", 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Thursday that it is proposing a rule to eliminate the so-called gun show loophole — one of the biggest attempts to regulate the sale of firearms ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Thursday that it is proposing a rule to eliminate the so-called gun show loophole — one of the biggest attempts to regulate the sale of firearms in years.\n\nThe administration said that new language in a law passed last year by Congress after the Uvalde school shooting is empowering it to take the action, though Second Amendment activists are likely to challenge the move in court.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is proposing a regulation that would essentially say that anyone who deals in firearms for profit must get a federal license — and conduct criminal background checks — regardless of whether they sell the guns in brick-and-mortar stores, gun shows, flea markets or on the internet. The new rule will go through the federal rulemaking process.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Thursday that the move is a result of the bipartisan law passed by Congress last year.\n\n“The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was passed by Congress to reduce gun violence, including by expanding the background checks that keep guns out of the hands of criminals,” he said. “This proposed rule implements Congress’s mandate to expand the definition of who must obtain a license and conduct a background check before selling firearms.”\n\nThe ""gun show loophole"" has been cited for years as a major hole in the federal background check system, allowing a vast number of private sales without background checks. The ATF currently licenses about 80,000 brick-and-mortar gun dealers, but gun sales are increasingly taking place outside that system, free of background checks.\n\nEarlier this year, Biden signed an executive order designed to expand background checks. It directed Garland to clarify the statutory definition of who is “engaged in the business” of selling firearms, an authority an administration official said was detailed in the bipartisan gun law.\n\nNBC News reported last year about some of the provisions of the law that led to Thursday\'s proposed rule. At the time, however, sources close to the negotiations behind the legislation tempered expectations that it could close the gun show loophole or have a significant effect on the sale of guns online, although they hoped it would bolster enforcement and oversight of the firearms market.\n\nThe sources said they had in mind the shooter in Midland-Odessa, Texas, who killed eight people in 2019 with a gun that he bought through a private sale. He had previously failed a background check from a licensed gun seller and was not allowed to buy a weapon.\n\nBiden touted the bipartisan legislation in June, a year after he signed it into law, saying that it was already saving lives.\n\nThe president said the law has allowed the Justice Department to run enhanced background checks through the FBI on adults under 21 who try to buy firearms. It has also provided funding to states to expand the so-called red flag laws that allow courts to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a danger to themselves or others. And it has provided money to states to boost mental health services, especially for young people. Biden also noted that the law closed the so-called boyfriend loophole by keeping guns away from unmarried dating partners convicted of abuse.\n\nBiden has long made it a priority to enact policies focused on curbing gun violence. He and then-President Barack Obama attempted to push Congress to pass such measures, and the closest it came was in 2013, a few months after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The Senate fell six votes short of advancing a bill by Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would have required background checks in all commercial gun sales.\n\nSince becoming president, while still pressuring Congress to pass legislation, Biden has also used his executive authority to try to reduce gun violence, although he faces limits. He has repeatedly called on lawmakers to pass another assault weapons ban in the wake of several mass shootings.\n\nThere\'s little chance of such a measure passing through both chambers of Congress. Republicans narrowly control the House, and Democrats have a thin majority in the Senate, meaning they would need substantial Republican support to overcome a filibuster.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-signs-landmark-gun-legislation-god-willing-s-going-lot-lives-rcna35326', 'Headline': ""Biden signs landmark gun legislation: 'God willing, it's going to save ..."", 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden signed into law the most sweeping legislation aimed at preventing gun violence in 30 years at the White House on Saturday shortly before departing for Europe for a series of ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden signed into law the most sweeping legislation aimed at preventing gun violence in 30 years at the White House on Saturday shortly before departing for Europe for a series of meetings with world leaders.\n\nBiden called the signing of the legislation a ""monumental day"" and said it was proof that Democrats and Republicans could find common ground on important issues.\n\n“God willing, it\'s going to save a lot of lives,"" he said.\n\nThe bill provides grants to states for “red flag” laws, enhances background checks to include juvenile records, and closes the “boyfriend loophole” by keeping guns away from unmarried dating partners convicted of abuse. It will also require enhanced background checks for people ages 18 to 21 and funding for youth mental health services.\n\nThe bipartisan gun legislation sped through Congress in the month after a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas. Democrats unanimously voted in favor of the bill along with more than two dozen Republicans in the House and the Senate, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\n""When it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential,"" Biden said. ""If we can reach a compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans health care to cutting-edge American innovation to so much more.""\n\nHe had pleaded with lawmakers to pass legislation tightening gun laws following the shootings in Buffalo, New York, and in Uvalde. But the bill stopped short of his call for Congress to ban assault weapons and to require background checks for all gun purchases, both of which are widely opposed by Republicans in Congress.\n\n“I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day,” Biden said. “God bless us with the strength to get the work left done.”\n\nThe bill gives Biden a win following two major blows from the Supreme Court over the past week. The court ruled Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade, eliminating a woman\'s constitutional right to an abortion. And on Thursday, it struck down a New York law that required showing a special need to get a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public.\n\n“I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions,” Biden said when asked about those rulings by a reporter.\n\nBiden signed the gun legislation moments before heading to Europe for a week of meetings with Group of Seven leaders in Germany and with NATO leaders in Spain. When he returns, he said, he plans to have an event at the White House with the lawmakers who helped pass the bill.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-another-life-saving-step-to-keep-guns-out-of-dangerous-hands/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Biden- - The White House', 'Snippet': 'It builds on previous Biden-Harris Administration actions to save lives and combat the epidemic of gun violence.

Today, as a result of the Executive Order and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the Department of Justice is taking life-saving action to reduce the number of guns sold without background checks and keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\n\nWhy the Biden-Harris Administration is Taking Action\n\nSince 1994, federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon. These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more than three million felons, convicted domestic abusers, and other dangerous individuals. However, despite the law, individuals who should be licensed dealers have refused to obtain a license, skirting the background check requirement.\n\nLast year, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law bipartisan legislation to help address this dangerous problem by modifying the definition of who has to become a federally licensed firearms dealer. Members of Congress—both Democrats and Republicans—made clear that they intended for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to better protect the American people from gun violence by clarifying when someone is supposed to become a licensed firearms dealer.\n\nNew Action to Keep Guns Out of Dangerous Hands\n\nToday, the Justice Department has announced a proposed rule to specify what exactly the new definition in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act means on the ground. If finalized, this proposed rule would mean the following for people who are not selling guns in order to make money: If you have a gun you no longer need, and you want to sell it to your family member, you do not need a license to sell it. If you buy and sell curios or relics or “collectible” personal firearms as a hobby, again, you do not need a license. But, if you are offering a firearm for sale to make money, and telling a customer that you can purchase and sell him additional firearms, you would presumptively need a license—and need to run background checks. The same is true if you repetitively offer for resale firearms within 30 days of when you purchased them. The proposed rule includes a number of other situations where, in civil and administrative proceedings and absent reliable evidence to the contrary, it will be presumed that you need a license.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed rule, if finalized, would clarify that an individual would be presumed to be “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms—and therefore be required to become a licensed firearms dealer and run background checks—if they meet certain conditions. For example, under the proposed rule, a person would be presumed to be required to become a licensed dealer and run background checks if they meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\nOffer for sale any number of firearms and also represents to potential buyers that they are willing and able to purchase and sell them additional firearms;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms within 30 days after they were purchased;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms that are like new in their original packaging;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale multiple firearms of the same make and model; or\n\nAs a formerly federally-licensed firearms dealer, sell firearms that were in the business inventory and not transferred to a personal collection at least a year before the sale, addressing the so-called “fire sale loophole.”\n\nThe proposed rule would also clarify that, for civil or administrative actions, an individual would be presumed to have the intent to “predominantly earn a profit”—one of the elements of engaging in the business of dealing firearms—if the person engages in activities such as:\n\nCreating a website or making business cards to advertise or market a firearms business;\n\nMaintaining records to document and track profits and losses from firearms purchases or sales; or\n\nPurchasing business insurance or renting space at a gun show.\n\nThe proposed rule would make clear that there is no “gun show loophole” or “internet loophole” in federal law. Dealers who engage in the business of selling guns are required to obtain a license and run background checks no matter where they engage in the business of buying and selling firearms. That include at gun shows and over the Internet.\n\nThe proposed rule is now open for public comment. The Department of Justice will consider the comments it receives in deciding on a final rule.\n\nContinuing to Call on Congress to Act\n\nThis rule is a significant step toward reducing the percentage of firearms sold for profit without background checks. It builds on previous Biden-Harris Administration actions to save lives and combat the epidemic of gun violence.\n\nHowever, to fully address this problem, Congress must act. The President continues to call on Congress to enact universal background checks legislation, as well as other commonsense legislation to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of guns, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. These are life-saving measures that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support to protect our Country from the threat of gun violence.\n\n###'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2023/presidential-candidates-2024-policies-issues/joe-biden-guns-crime/', 'Headline': 'Where Joe Biden stands on crime and guns - Washington Post', 'Snippet': 'Joe Biden supports restricting access to guns for people who may harm themselves or others, and he supports requiring expanded background checks.

Follow ...', 'Full_text': 'White House press secretary Jen Psaki outlined President Biden’s process for finding a replacement for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, noting that the President has been reviewing prospective nominee bios “since last year” in preparation for a Supreme Court opening.\n\n“Ron Klain and Dana Remus have been involved in consulting with the President, preparing bios for him, and that’s something that he’s looked at since last year,” she said.\n\nIn White House remarks today, Biden committed to nominating the nation’s first Black female Supreme Court justice and said he expects to choose a nominee before the end of February.\n\nPsaki listed off who will be part of the team at the White House assisting through the selection and confirmation process for a new justice, noting the “central role” Vice President Kamala Harris will play in deliberations.\n\nAlong with those White House advisers, Psaki said the White House intends to bring in outside expertise, adding that she expects that team to be in place prior to the final selection of a nominee. The White House, she said, will be consulting with “a range of groups” on the nomination. She plans to give more details on those groups in the coming days.\n\nBiden, through his previous experiences in the Senate, brings with him a “recognition of the historic role that this process plays, including the importance of somebody who is imminently qualified, which he has every intention of doing, and consulting with Democrats and Republicans in the Senate.”\n\nThe President, she said, has conveyed that this will be a “rigorous process.” “(H)e will meet with potential nominees, he will study their records carefully, and he is going to take all of the advice that he can get,” she added.\n\nShe also noted that Breyer “hand delivered” his retirement letter to the President this morning.\n\nWhatever issues Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have caused for President Biden’s legislative agenda, their records on Biden’s judicial confirmation efforts are a positive signal for the President as he seeks to replace the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer.\n\nNeither Manchin nor Sinema has voted against any of Biden’s lower court nominees so far — including Biden’s picks for the federal judiciary who have attracted significant Republican heat.\n\nManchin and Sinema stuck with the rest of the Democratic caucus when Republicans were united against the confirmation of Jennifer Sung to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals — a confirmation that required the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris to move forward.\n\nManchin in particular has attracted liberal ire for holding up Biden’s Build Back Better spending plan, and both the West Virginia Democrat and Sinema voted against Democrats’ efforts to end the use of the 60-vote filibuster on voting rights legislation. But the filibuster isn’t in play for Supreme Court votes anymore.\n\nSince Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell pushed through a change in filibuster rules in 2017 to confirm Neil Gorsuch, it just requires a party-line, simple majority vote to advance a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nIn the 50-50 Senate, all Democrats need to do is stay united, with Harris breaking a potential tie in the event no Republicans break ranks.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell released a statement Thursday on Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer’s retirement and urged President Biden against “outsourcing” his decision on a replacement to the “radical left.”\n\nHe continued, “The President must not outsource this important decision to the radical left. The American people deserve a nominee with demonstrated reverence for the written text of our laws and our Constitution.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki criticized McConnell’s statement and warning.\n\nShe added that the President plans to work with members of both parties “in good faith.”\n\n“Our intention is to not play games. The President’s intention is to consult with members of both parties. And his intention is to nominate a qualified candidate who after completing a rigorous is worthy of the excellence and decency of Breyer’s legacy,” she continued.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer reflected on his role during nearly his 30-year career on the highest court in the US — which he called a “complicated country” — praising the “rule of law” and ultimately concluding that he thinks the “American experiment” will succeed, in remarks from the White House announcing his retirement from the bench.\n\nHe began his brief remarks by thanking President Biden for his “terribly nice” introduction, before turning to what he said was the speech he generally gives to groups of high school students.\n\nBreyer said that while people often “don’t agree,” the country is “based on human rights, democracy and so forth.”\n\nBreyer said that both Presidents Abraham Lincoln and George Washington both deeply believed in the “experiment” of democracy. He quoted the opening lines of Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.\n\nBreyer said he believes the next generation will make sure democracy endures.\n\nWhen news broke of Justice Stephen Breyer’s expected retirement on Wednesday, one of the biggest questions President Biden confronted right away was whether he planned to appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court as he had promised during his presidential campaign.\n\nBiden confirmed Thursday during remarks with Breyer that he will nominate a Black woman to the court.\n\nBut for some civil rights leaders, that was a question they already knew the answer to.\n\nCivil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton said he recalls that in at least one private setting since Biden took office, the President reiterated to Sharpton his commitment to his pledge of appointing a Black woman to the bench.\n\n“He brought it up that … he’s going to keep his word if the opening comes up,” Sharpton said.\n\nSharpton, who said he has already reached out to the White House since the news of Breyer’s retirement broke on Wednesday, said he planned to push the White House to keep pushing on voting rights reform.\n\nBiden’s campaign promise was such a “bold commitment,” said Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, that he too, has not questioned whether the President would ultimately keep it. Morial said one of his primary concerns was that the White House move with speed through the confirmation process.\n\nBoth Sharpton and Morial told CNN that for now, they did not plan to publicly make an endorsement of any candidate, saying that the President should be given space to come to what will ultimately be his final decision.\n\n“It is fair he should be given room to make the selection as long as she is qualified,” Sharpton said. “As long as he keeps his word, we should not get into an internal fight on which one of the picks, when we’ve never had a Black woman. We should not undo what could be a great moment.”\n\nMorial echoed that it would be “counter-productive to get into the game of speculation because many of the names that had been recommended are acceptable.”\n\n“I’m not recommending anyone at this time because I think that the President should be given the prerogative to make a decision,” he added.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer’s retirement leaves an empty seat to fill on the nine-member bench of the highest court in the US.\n\nPresident Biden said today he intends to announce his nominee by the end of February.\n\nOnce that occurs, there will next be a formal confirmation process, including public hearings. There’s a committee vote and a Senate floor vote.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday vowed that whoever Biden nominates for the court will be confirmed with “all deliberate speed.” Biden will have to nominate someone who can safely get 50 votes in the Senate, as Democrats currently hold only the most narrow of majorities in the chamber.\n\nThe President hopes a swift process will lead to a confirmed justice by spring.\n\nHere’s how all of this will work:\n\nWhat happens after the nomination?\n\nThere will be hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Dick Durbin.\n\nHow long does the process usually take?\n\nIt varies. Justice Amy Coney Barrett was sworn in on Oct. 26, 2020, a week before the 2020 election, after former President Trump nominated her a month beforehand following Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death. Here’s a deeper look into how long it has taken for past justices to be confirmed.\n\nHow many votes does it take to confirm a new justice?\n\nIt takes only a simple majority. Vice President Kamala Harris can break a 50-50 tie.\n\nHow long do most Supreme Court justices serve?\n\nThe average length of a Supreme Court tenure has grown a lot. Harvard Business Review did an actuarial analysis in 2018 and argued the average tenure over the next 100 years will grow to 35 years. It was 17 over the previous 100 years. Breyer was sworn in by former President Clinton in 1994.\n\nRead more about the process here.\n\nCNN’s Zachary B. Wolf Ariane de Vogue, Kate Sullivan and Betsy Klein contributed reporting to this post.\n\nPresident Biden and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer will hold an event soon at the White House to mark the justice’s retirement.\n\nDuring the campaign trail, Biden vowed that if he were to get a vacancy he would put a Black woman on the high court.\n\nWell before Stephen Breyer’s retirement plans became public, a short list of potential nominees had been circulating Washington and officials in the White House Counsel’s office built files on various candidates in anticipation of a potential vacancy. Now, those efforts will ramp up significantly and the President will likely hold one-on-one meetings before announcing his pick.\n\nWhile the President nor the White House have announced a nominee, here are potential picks who have been on observers’ short list:\n\nDC Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson: Biden has already elevated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson once, appointing her last year to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is considered the second-most powerful federal court in the country. Previously, the 51-year-old judge served on the federal district court in DC. Because of that appellate appointment, she’s already been through a vetting process that included an interview with the President himself. Fittingly, she clerked for Breyer and holds degrees from Harvard and Harvard Law School. She also served as an assistant federal public defender, making her a prime example of the Biden White House’s focus on appointing judges with backgrounds that are outside the typical prosecutor and Big Law box.\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger: Kruger, now 45, was the youngest person to be appointed to the California Supreme Court when then-Gov. Jerry Brown nominated her in 2014. Kruger is intimately familiar with the Supreme Court having worked as a clerk for the late Justice John Paul Stevens and served as acting deputy solicitor general in the Obama administration. While in the Solicitor General’s office, she argued 12 cases in front of the Supreme Court representing the government. At the Justice Department, she also earned the Attorney General’s Award for Exceptional Service, the department’s highest award for employee performance, in 2013 and 2014.\n\nSouth Carolina US District Court Judge J. Michelle Childs: Childs, a judge on South Carolina’s federal court, is said to have a major booster in House Majority Whip James Clyburn, a Biden ally who helped deliver South Carolina for the eventual nominee in the 2020 Democratic primary. Just last month, Biden nominated Childs to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the nomination remains pending.\n\nOther names that have been floated:\n\nDistrict Judge Wilhelmina “Mimi” Wright, a judge on Minnesota’s federal district court whose consideration would likely please Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nCircuit Judge Eunice Lee, a former New York public defender whom Biden nominated to the Second Circuit on the recommendation of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nCircuit Judge Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, an alumna of Chicago’s public defender’s office whose appointment by Biden to the Seventh Circuit was cheered by Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin of Illinois.\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, a civil rights attorney who recently announced plans to step down from her role as President and Director-Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\nRead more about the possible nominees here.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said he has not spoken to President Biden or Clyburn’s top pick for the Supreme Court to replace Justice Stephen Breyer, South Carolina Judge J. Michelle Childs, since the news broke that Breyer would be retiring.\n\n“No, I have not talked to President Biden or with Michelle Childs in the last 24 or 48 hours or even the last several days. In fact, I can’t remember the last time I talked with Michelle. I did talk with the President a couple of weeks ago,” Clyburn said on Washington Post Live.\n\nAlthough Clyburn said the women on the shortlist to replace Breyer are “all great people,” he made a clear pitch for why Childs should be the judge to serve as the next justice on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe White House said yesterday that Biden stands by his commitment to nominate a Black woman to the high court, which would be a historic first.\n\nClyburn said that “she has what I call the kind of background and experiences that we ought to have, that judges and juries ought to have.”\n\n“It is time for us to diversify the court — not just as it relates to the gender but as it relates to color as well and as it relates to backgrounds and experiences. And it would help to have somebody from the South,” Clyburn added. “She would bring a unique perspective to the Supreme Court.”\n\nClyburn argued that Childs could “absolutely” win Republican support, a clear metric that Biden said he’d be looking for in a nominee. Clyburn said that South Carolina Republican Sens. Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham know Childs “very well” and “have spoken highly” of her.\n\nClyburn pushed back on the notion that Childs doesn’t have enough experience because she has yet to serve on the DC District Court, though she was just nominated to that circuit. When asked if he thought that DC Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson would be a better fit to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Clyburn said that while he does not have anything against Jackson, he argued that “more experience doesn’t mean the best experience.”\n\nAlthough Clyburn made his case for Childs, he acknowledged that this is ultimately Biden’s decision.\n\n“I’m letting my feelings be known, and the White House can feel what they need to. And I’ll just react accordingly,” he said.\n\nSpeaking broadly, Clyburn talked about the importance of Biden nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court, especially considering his commitment to do so at the Charleston presidential debate two years ago.\n\n“How many times have you heard it said that Black women are the backbone of the Democratic party? Well, you just can’t say it; you got to show it,” Clyburn said.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer, a consistently liberal-leaning vote on the Supreme Court, is set to announce his retirement after serving nearly 28 years.\n\nThe announcement comes after Breyer repeatedly stated that he was undecided on his retirement plans as recently as last year.\n\nBreyer, age 83, was nominated by former President Bill Clinton in 1994 and sworn in on Aug. 3 of that year.\n\nWith an unflappable belief in the US system of government and a pragmatic view of the law, he has served nearly three decades on the bench.\n\nBreyer has sought to focus the law on how it could work for the average citizen. He was no firebrand and was quick to say that the Supreme Court couldn’t solve all of society’s problems. He often stressed that the court shouldn’t be seen as part of the political branches but recognized that certain opinions could be unpopular.\n\n“If the public sees judges as ‘politicians in robes,’” he warned, “its confidence in the courts, and in the rule of law itself, can only diminish, diminishing the court’s power, including its power to act as a ‘check’ on the other branches.”\n\nIn April 2020, Breyer appeared in a public service announcement urging individuals to fill out their census questionnaires, emphasizing how vital the information will be as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic — a rare move for an active member of the Supreme Court.\n\nBreyer is known for his support for a woman’s right to have a legal abortion, which became a point of controversy when he was given an award by Fordham University, a Jesuit school.\n\nIn 2015, in the case Glossip v. Gross,Breyer raised the question of whether the death penalty is unconstitutional in a 40-page minority dissenting opinion, which late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined. The judges voted 5-4 to uphold the use of a controversial drug for lethal injection in executions.\n\nEarly in his career, Breyer was law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg from 1964-1965.\n\nBreyer was also special assistant to the assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice from 1965 to 1967.\n\nBreyer was a former assistant prosecutor during the Watergate hearings in the 1970s.\n\nA little over a decade before he was sworn in to the Supreme Court, Breyer served as chief counsel for the US Senate Judiciary Committee from 1979 to 1980 and served as a judge for the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit from 1981 to 1990. Breyer served as the chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nOn the campaign trail, President Biden vowed that if he were to get a vacancy he would fill it with a Black woman, which would represent a historic first for the high court. Potential candidates include Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, 51, who was confirmed last year to the powerful DC-based appellate court. She once served as a law clerk for Breyer and also worked as an assistant federal public defender and served on the US Sentencing Commission.\n\nBreyer is expected to stay on until the end of the term and until a replacement is confirmed.\n\nAfter a series of recent stinging legislative defeats, Senate Democrats may soon be able to deliver a win for their party.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is looking at a quick time frame to confirm President Joe Biden’s nominee to the Supreme Court — and he will follow a similar timeline that Republicans employed to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the court in 2020, according to a source familiar with his thinking.\n\nSenate sources also say that the Senate can act on the Biden nominee before Justice Stephen Breyer officially steps down from the court. So Democrats expect to hold hearings and votes before Breyer officially steps aside at the end of his term.\n\nThe late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on Sept. 18, 2020 — and Barrett was nominated on Sept. 26, 2020. She was confirmed Oct. 26, 2020 — just days before the election, prompting Democratic anger.\n\nSenate Democrats are confident that whomever Biden picks to replace Breyer, the nominee will receive enough votes to get confirmed, according to senior Democratic sources.\n\nThat’s because of both the math and the history. Since Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell pushed through a change in filibuster rules in 2017, it just requires a party-line, simple majority vote to advance a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nIn the 50-50 Senate, all Democrats need to stay united with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a potential tie in the event no Republicans break ranks.\n\nSchumer indicated in a statement on Wednesday he plans to move swiftly toward a confirmation vote once a nomination is made.\n\n“President Biden’s nominee will receive a prompt hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and will be considered and confirmed by the full United States Senate with all deliberate speed,” Schumer said.\n\nSchumer later echoed that sentiment in brief public remarks. “In the Senate we want to be deliberate, we want to move quickly, we want to get this done as soon as possible,” he said.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in a statement, “I look forward to moving the President’s nominee expeditiously through the Committee.”\n\nAlthough Presidents Biden’s pick to replace Justice Stephen Breyer will not change the balance of the court, given that Breyer will almost certainly be replaced with a fellow liberal, the new nominee is expected to be much younger and could serve on the court for decades.\n\nThe court currently has six conservative justices appointed by Republican presidents, and three liberals appointed by Democrats.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Biden vowed that if he were to get a vacancy he would fill it with an African American woman, which would represent a historic first for the high court. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that Biden “certainly stands by” the promise, but declined to offer any specifics.\n\nPotential candidates include Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, 51, who was confirmed last year to the powerful DC-based appellate court. She once served as a law clerk for Breyer, and also worked as an assistant federal public defender and served on the US Sentencing Commission.\n\nAnother possibility would be Justice Leondra Kruger, 45, who serves on the California Supreme Court and is a veteran of the US Solicitor General’s office. Members of Biden’s team have previously stressed that they are seeking diversity for judicial appointments and that they are prepared to break from the norm and consider those whose legal experiences have been historically underrepresented on the federal bench, including those who are public defenders and civil rights and legal aid attorneys.\n\nHere’s a look at the current makeup of the court:'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-formally-kick-scotus-search-breyer-s-retirement-announcement-n1288092', 'Headline': ""Biden announces Breyer's retirement, pledges to nominate Black woman to ..."", 'Snippet': ""President Joe Biden's next nominee will help shape the court for years to come and act as a political tool to motivate the Democratic base. IE 11 is not supported. For an optimal experience visit ..."", 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden formally announced the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer on Thursday, thanking him for his ""remarkable"" service and reaffirming his commitment to nominating the first Black woman to the court.\n\n""The person I will nominate will be someone of extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity, and that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court,"" Biden said. ""I made that commitment during the campaign for president, and I will keep that commitment.""\n\n""It\'s long overdue in my opinion,"" he said, noting that he would make his choice by the end of February.\n\nThe announcement kicks off what will be a monthslong dance in Washington, with candidates jockeying for the rare vacancy, the White House embarking on a vetting process, and congressional lawmakers using the confirmation process to score political points.\n\nBiden\'s selection will not only help shape the court for years to come, it will also provide a political tool to motivate the Democratic base as well as divert attention from his floundering legislative agenda.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Biden promised in 2020 to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. The move could re-energize Black voters who have grown disillusioned with the president over his failure to push voting rights legislation through Congress.\n\nDemocratic senators have been urging Biden to carry through on his pledge to nominate a Black woman ahead of Biden\'s remarks Thursday. ""The court should reflect the diversity of our country, and it is unacceptable that we have never in our nation’s history had a Black woman sit on the Supreme Court of the United States — I want to change that,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., in a statement Wednesday.\n\nIn selecting a replacement, Biden said he will seek the ""advice and consent"" of the Senate and will invite senators from both parties to share their input on a nominee. He also said he will solicit advice from scholars and lawyers, along with Vice President Kamala Harris, given her extensive legal background.\n\n""I will listen carefully to all the advice I\'m given, and I\'ll study the records and former cases carefully, I\'ll meet with the potential nominees, and it\'s my intention, my intention to announce my decision before the end of February. I have made no choice at this point,"" Biden said. ""Once I select a nominee, I\'ll ask the Senate to move promptly on my choice.""\n\nThe most high-profile contenders are federal appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger and Michelle Childs, a judge on the U.S. district court in South Carolina. Two others being considered are New York University law professor Melissa Murray and Wilhelmina Wright, a judge on the U.S. district court in Minnesota, said a source familiar with the White House\'s process.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that Biden intends to name the nominee by the end of February, while noting that isn\'t a ""set deadline."" Biden has been reviewing candidates since last year, she said, adding that he ""believes that sitting judges can make excellent justices but he does not view that as a prerequisite.""\n\nIn addition to Harris, Biden will also consult with White House chief of staff Ron Klain, senior adviser Cedric Richmond, White House counsel Dana Remus and head of legislative affairs Louisa Terrell, Psaki said.\n\nDuring remarks at the White House, Breyer warned of the challenges he sees ahead for the American experiment and said that it would be up to future generations to determine whether that experiment will continue to work.\n\n""We are now engaged in a great civil war to determine whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure,"" Breyer said, adding that he\'s an ""optimist and I\'m pretty sure it will.""\n\nIt is rare for a sitting justice to announce their retirement at the White House given the court\'s independence from the executive branch. Traditionally, they notify the White House of their retirement in a formal letter.\n\nSupreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John G. Roberts shared warm and humorous statements about their colleague following his announcement.\n\n""His pragmatism, encyclopedic knowledge, and varied government experience have enriched the Court’s deliberations,"" Roberts said. ""He is also a reliable antidote to dead airtime at our lunches, moving seamlessly from modern architecture to French cinema, to old radio shows, to a surprisingly comprehensive collection of riddles and knock-knock jokes.""\n\nAlthough Breyer’s tenure on the court draws to a close, Thomas said, ""our friendship and deep affection redoubles and endures.""\n\n""I will miss him. He is brilliant, passionate about the law, and dedicated to the Court. He is funny, optimistic, and giving,"" Sotomayor said. ""We all will miss his commitment to seeking consensus and ensuring collegiality in all we do. He has served the country with honor.""\n\nAs a candidate, Biden was critical of the speed with which Republicans confirmed Barrett to the high court in the final weeks of the Trump presidency.\n\nIf Democrats are able to maintain their slim Senate majority, there is little Republicans can do to stop Biden\'s pick from being confirmed. But confirmations haven\'t always gone as expected. Unanticipated controversies have developed in the past, such as the sexual assault allegations that threatened Kavanaugh\'s confirmation.\n\nMany progressives have said they expect Jackson to be a top potential successor. The Senate confirmed her to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last year in a 53-44 vote, with the support of three Republicans: Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\nChilds, a 2010 Obama appointee, is reportedly backed by House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a prominent Biden ally. Kruger served as principal deputy U.S. solicitor general during the Obama administration.\n\nThe progressive group Demand Justice has researched many of the potential candidates and “we feel pretty ready to defend the record of whoever Biden picks,” said the group’s executive director, Brian Fallon.\n\nFallon said Demand Justice plans to run advertisements after the nominee is announced, though he did not say how much the group would spend. He added that they also plan to make a push in states with Republican senators in an attempt to sway them.\n\n“There\'s a possibility that some Republicans vote for this nominee,” Fallon said. “At least, it\'s reasonable to think they could.”\n\nBiden’s ability to replace Breyer will not change the court\'s 6-3 conservative advantage. At 83, Breyer is the court\'s oldest member, and liberal activists have urged him for months to retire while Democrats hold both the White House and the Senate — a position that could change after the midterm elections in November.\n\n""The significance is almost impossible to overstate,"" Jon Meacham, a presidential historian, said on MSNBC Thursday.

That is not a new development, as several viral tweets have misleadingly claimed in recent days.\n\n“Joe Biden just announced the US is going to be supporting the pensions in Ukraine,” conservative commentator Jack Posobiec wrote in a Feb. 17 tweet. The post included a 29-second clip of Biden’s remarks that has been viewed almost 8 million times.\n\nThen on Feb. 18, John Basham, a former Texas city councilman, tweeted an even shorter video of Biden’s remarks about pensions and wrote: “BREAKING: @JoeBiden Announced The US #TaxPayers Will Now Be PAYING The #Pensions & #Welfare For The People Of #Ukraine. This, While MILLIONS Of Americans Can’t Pay Food, Housing, Or Medical Due To Biden’s Policies. Also, While Thousands Of Americans Are HOMELESS & On The Street!”\n\nRepublican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia then retweeted Basham’s post the same day and called on Congress to impeach the president.\n\nWhat Biden said in the clip may have come as news to some, but he said it nearly 10 months ago — about funding that became law with bipartisan support only weeks later.\n\nIn remarks from the White House on April 28, 2022, Biden announced that he had signed a request for Congress to pass a bill authorizing a second round of “critical security, economic and humanitarian assistance to help Ukraine continue to counter [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s aggression.” Biden said additional financing was needed because money that Congress approved for Ukraine in late March 2022 — about a month after Russia launched its invasion — was running out.\n\nHe said the supplemental funding “addresses the needs of the Ukrainian military during the crucial weeks and months ahead,” while also providing “food, water, medicines, shelter and other aid to Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s war.” Then he added: “It’s also going to help schools and hospitals open. It’s going to allow pensions and social support to be paid to the Ukrainian people so they have something — something in their pocket. It’s also going to provide critical resources to address food shortages around the globe.”\n\nBiden’s official request came a few days after Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko told the Washington Post that Ukraine needed at least $2 billion per month in emergency economic aid from the U.S. “Marchenko said Ukraine is seeking the economic support to continue to pay for pensions, salaries for health care and education officials, and other humanitarian needs,” the Post reported.\n\nIn a press briefing hours after Biden’s announcement, then-White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki defended the plan to allow some funding to be used for pensions and other “social support.”\n\n“Well, look, I would say that we have provided a range of economic assistance, because we know that their economy has been devastated — not of their doing, because they were invaded by a foreign country,” Psaki said in response to a reporter who asked why Americans should be OK with the U.S. funding pensions for the people of Ukraine.\n\n“We provide assistance — economic and humanitarian assistance — to a range of countries around the world because that’s part of American leadership. And so, I would say that’s the reasoning for this assistance being proposed in the package,” Psaki said.\n\nA White House fact sheet published online the same day said that Biden requested a total of $33 billion for Ukraine, but Congress ultimately authorized $40 billion — of which about $15 billion was for humanitarian and economic aid, as we have explained before.\n\nThe bill, known as the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, passed by wide margins in the House (368 to 57) and Senate (86 to 11), and then Biden signed it on May 21, 2022. It was the second of four aid packages for Ukraine that Congress approved in 2022 — all with support from Democrats and Republicans.\n\nGreene voted against the bill, but all four House Republican leaders at the time — Reps. Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise, Elise Stefanik and Gary Palmer — voted for it.\n\nWe checked the text of the supplemental appropriations legislation, but found no mention of a specific amount designated to pay pensions. The White House also did not provide clarification when we asked about Biden’s remarks from last year.\n\nIn total, about $113.1 billion in funding for Ukraine was authorized in 2022, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Most of that – about $67.1 billion – was for defense-related spending, the CRFB said. The other $46 billion included $26.9 billion for an economic support fund; $7.9 billion for international disaster assistance; $6.6 billion in assistance for refugees; $1.5 billion for assistance for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia; plus another $3.1 billion for other nondefense spending.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development has been coordinating with the Treasury Department to distribute authorized economic aid to Ukraine in tranches. In a report published on Feb. 17, USAID said it had so far provided $13 billion in “direct budget support” to the government of Ukraine, or “GoU” for short.\n\n“This funding has helped the GoU pay the salaries of 618,000 educators, 517,000 health workers, and 56,500 first responders,” the report says. “It has also helped the GoU to sustain critical healthcare services, meet its pension responsibilities for 9.8 million people, assist 1.3 million internally displaced persons, provide housing assistance to 4.1 million people, and provide social assistance to 240,000 low-income families and 480,000 persons with disabilities.”\n\nThat report did not say how much was spent on pensions, but a USAID spokesperson sent us another USAID report to Congress that indicated $4 billion of budget support for Ukraine was spent on pensions as of Nov. 30, 2022.\n\nThe bottom line: While the video of Biden talking about providing funding to pay Ukrainian pensioners may have caught some by surprise recently, it does not change the fact that he made those comments before Congress approved the money months ago on a bipartisan basis.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 23: After we published this story, a USAID spokesperson responded to our request for more information. We updated this story to include the amount spent on pensions as of Nov. 30, 2022.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/scotus-confirmation-white-house-breyer/index.html', 'Headline': 'Inside Biden’s calculated response to Breyer’s retirement', 'Snippet': 'Biden’s White House has created a judicial nomination machine during the President’s first year in office, vetting and selecting a raft of diverse candidates to fill open spots on the federal ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden received a much-needed political opening on Wednesday. But neither he, nor anyone close to him, appeared ready to celebrate it.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer’s retirement plans were publicly revealed before the White House or the justice himself was expecting it, leading to a muted response from Biden and his aides. The White House – which had learned of Breyer’s plans last week, though the justice did not inform the President directly – had been preparing for the moment for more than a year. But a subdued reaction from Biden was indicative of something he has made clear for months: He won’t abide any pressure from his team, however subtle, on Breyer to step down.\n\n“Let him make whatever statement he’s going to make,” the President said in the State Dining Room as a group of chief executives looked on. “And I’ll be happy to talk about it later.”\n\nThe awkward moment – with Biden remaining mum even as many Democrats were celebrating news that could provide him a badly needed political boost – reflected an announcement that had not come as many had planned, least of all the President.\n\nWhen it did come a day later, as Biden and Breyer formalized the news in the White House Roosevelt Room, the President’s esteem for the retiring justice was evident.\n\n“Today is his day,” Biden declared, recounting a shared history that began in the 1970s.\n\n“We were joking with one another when he walked in, did he ever think he would have served decades on the court and I would be President of the United States the day he came in to retire?” Biden said, declining to offer Breyer’s answer.\n\nLater, after Breyer quoted the Gettysburg Address in his own remarks, Biden invited the justice and his wife to spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom, just upstairs in the White House residence.\n\nGiving Breyer his due after nearly three decades on the bench has been a priority of Biden’s, even as Democrats outside his administration were clamoring for him to retire. Still, that has not stopped the process of selecting Breyer’s successor from quietly taking shape. Groundwork has been carefully laid for a process that will unfold over the coming weeks, which the President hopes will lead to a confirmed justice by spring.\n\nHe said Thursday he planned to solicit advice from lawmakers, legal experts and Vice President Kamala Harris before announcing a nominee before the end of February. He affirmed he would uphold his campaign pledge of nominating a Black woman, saying it was “long overdue.”\n\nBiden’s White House has created a judicial nomination machine during the President’s first year in office, vetting and selecting a raft of diverse candidates to fill open spots on the federal bench at a pace that outstrips most of Biden’s most recent predecessors. The President also has a deeply experienced player in a key role for the coming high-stakes process – his top adviser, chief of staff Ron Klain, has played a major part in nine different Supreme Court nominations over the last several decades.\n\nThe administration plans to move quickly now that Breyer has handed over the letter that officially notified the President of his intention to retire.\n\nAfter months of deference to the justice, with White House aides parsing interviews for clues on his intentions, the President is looking to chalk up a political win that could brighten his party’s dim political prospects in the fall – even if won’t change the ideological makeup of the high court.\n\n“Anything that changes the subject is good news. It’s been a rough stretch for him. It is a chance for him both to fulfill a promise and do something that unifies his caucus and gives him a win,” said David Axelrod, a senior adviser in the Obama administration and a CNN senior political commentator.\n\n“This is a propitious time to be talking about the Supreme Court. If the current court does as we expect and guts Roe vs. Wade in the spring, this could be a motivating factor for voters on the Democratic side, particularly women, particularly in the suburbs, which will be important. And having a stellar nominee who impresses joining the bench after June could be part of that mix.”\n\nBiden likely to act quickly\n\nThe President is famously slow announcing many of his major decisions, with longtime advisers often explaining that he does not like to be rushed. But the Supreme Court nomination is one of the most consequential choices of his presidency, with such a compelling sense of urgency, officials believe he is likely to act far more swiftly than in other decisions he’s made since taking office.\n\nWhile advisers to Biden say they do not believe he has a single pick in mind, they suspect he has narrowed his preferred choices from the list of five or six judges whose names have circulated in judicial and political circles.\n\n“The President appreciates the urgency of this,” a longtime adviser said, “but the timing and the decision is his and his alone to make.”\n\nDemocrats outside the White House said they expected the nomination and confirmation process to track closely with tradition each step of the way, even if there’s a deliberate effort to quicken the pace.\n\nThe President has been thinking about a Supreme Court vacancy for nearly two years, since he declared at a presidential debate in February 2020 that he intended to select a Black woman, saying later: “It’s required that they have representation now. It’s long overdue.”\n\nHe first made the commitment in South Carolina, where Black voters make up a sizable portion of the electorate and which is a crucial battleground where his campaign was struggling to gain traction. It helped Biden secure key endorsements, including from House Majority Whip James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat. Biden went on to win the South Carolina primary, helping to lift his prospects on Super Tuesday.\n\nDuring his presidential transition, the Supreme Court was a central part of the planning discussed between Biden, Klain and other top advisers. His longtime role on the Senate Judiciary Committee – and the fresh lesson from Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation – heightened his interest in the subject.\n\nDuring transition meetings in Wilmington, Delaware, after the election, as his new administration was taking shape, there were recurring conversations about the Supreme Court, despite no signs of an immediate vacancy. The Barrett confirmation in the final weeks of the Trump presidency infuriated Biden, people familiar with the meetings said, and fueled his interest in filling a vacancy of his own.\n\nKlain in the spotlight\n\nKlain, a former Supreme Court clerk and chief counsel on the Judiciary Committee, has taken a keen interest in Biden’s efforts to put his stamp on the judiciary, the people said. At the Judiciary panel, he helped Biden shepherd nominations and manage hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.\n\nLater, when Klain was serving as an associate White House counsel, Justice Byron White asked Klain, his former clerk, to deliver his resignation letter to then-President Bill Clinton. Klain went on to play a role in the selection process for White’s successor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And he advised President Barack Obama on his Supreme Court elevations of then-federal appellate Judge Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 and then-US Solicitor General Elena Kagan in 2010 – Klain and Kagan had been students together at Harvard Law School.\n\nKlain was also deeply involved when Breyer was a contender to replace White on the court when he retired in 1993. Klain interviewed Breyer from his hospital bed, where Breyer was recovering from injuries sustained during a bicycle accident. Because he had a punctured lung, Breyer could not fly to Washington for his lunch with Clinton and instead had to take a train, causing an indiscreet arrival for a usually highly secretive meeting.\n\nThis will be the ninth Supreme Court nomination in which Klain has been closely involved.\n\n“You aren’t going to find anyone with more experience in this world than Klain,” said a Democrat who has dealt with the Biden White House on judicial nominations. “It doesn’t mean he’s running the show, but for all the experience their team has in the counsel’s office, there’s nobody who understands this – not just the process, but the importance of this moment – like Ron.”\n\nIf past is precedent, Biden will take his time interviewing possible candidates and hearing from allies who are pushing their own hopefuls. Aside from Biden and Klain, the White House is filled with staff intimately familiar with the process. The current White House counsel and national security adviser both served as Supreme Court clerks, and veterans of the Obama administration worked on the former President’s two nominations to the court.\n\nBy many accounts, US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is a front-runner for the nomination. She has the qualities Biden says he wants, once served as an assistant federal public defender, and was recently vetted and confirmed for the lower court. She is also a former Breyer clerk and a relative by marriage to a prominent Republican – former House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nBiden turns to his judicial nomination machine\n\nYet reaping the benefits of a successful Supreme Court nomination is not a given. The process is rife with opportunities for stumbles, as Biden knows well from watching various confirmation battles in his years on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nSuccessful confirmations are run with precision, utilizing the various departments within the White House – press and communications teams, lawyers in the counsel’s office and logistics specialists – to introduce a nominee to the American people and individual lawmakers.\n\nFor an administration that has placed steadfast focus on creating and maintaining a pipeline of vetted and qualified judicial nominees, much of the work on preparing for a potential vacancy has been done. Some of the contenders who have been seen as possible candidates for the high court have already been nominated for lower courts. But others haven’t yet been submitted for federal roles, one person familiar with the operation said.\n\nBiden – who oversaw six Supreme Court nominations as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Breyer’s in 1994 – has taken a specific interest in some of the higher-profile circuit court nominees, interviewing several of his earliest selections himself.\n\nOne of those Biden spoke with in advance of her March nomination to the powerful US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was Jackson, who visited the White House last February 24 to meet with Biden and White House counsel Dana Remus.\n\nBiden is likely to meet with other candidates, though the White House has already made known those conversations will be confidential. When his administration restored a policy of publicly disclosing White House visitor logs, it specified that potential Supreme Court nominees wouldn’t be included.\n\nA focus on diverse judicial picks\n\nAs soon as news broke Wednesday of Breyer’s planned retirement, others were putting forward their preferred candidates, suggesting the President won’t be receiving unanimous support from all corners of his party.\n\nRuben Gonzales, executive director of LGBTQ Victory Institute, suggested Washington state Supreme Court Justice G. Helen Whitener: “We urge President Biden to make history and appoint a Black LGBTQ woman to the US Supreme Court,” the group said in a statement.\n\nClyburn, a close ally of Biden’s who had encouraged him during his campaign to vow to nominate a Black woman for the court, has pushed for Judge J. Michelle Childs. Alumni of the Obama administration have also voiced a preference for Leondra Kruger, who served in the solicitor general’s office.\n\nWhile Biden’s pledge to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court was a significant campaign moment from which he’s never wavered, his administration’s approach to its nominees across the federal bench has carried a similar focus on diversity.\n\nOf the 40 Biden nominees confirmed by the Senate, 78% are women and 53% are people of color. The focus on diversity has gone beyond personal backgrounds, with 20% of those confirmed having been civil rights lawyers and 40% serving as public defenders during their legal careers.\n\nWhile Biden hasn’t outlined how professional background will factor into his eventual selection, it has been a significant focus for some Democrats. The administration has sought to create an unofficial model for nominees that departs sharply from past administrations of both parties that tended to favor overwhelmingly White, Ivy League-educated judges trained at prominent law firms.\n\nPopulating the federal bench with diversity in both personal and professional background is designed to add new points of view and experiences to the judicial ranks, administration officials said. But it has a secondary effect as well: elevating a roster of younger and more diverse judges who can be added to shortlists for higher courts – or the highest court.\n\nReading the Breyer tea leaves\n\nWhen Breyer sat for a round of interviews last summer to promote his new book, White House aides parsed his answers about potential retirement, including when he told CNN that both his health and his new position as the court’s senior liberal would weigh on his thinking. He expanded further to The New York Times later, saying he would factor in who was choosing his successor when deciding whether to step down.\n\nThe comments led to rounds of speculation among some Biden advisers of what Breyer’s intentions really were as it became clear that the justice would not retire ahead of this year’s term. Some viewed the comments as a sign he was taking into consideration the makeup of the Senate.\n\nDespite that speculation, Biden’s aides have long taken pains to avoid weighing in on a potential Supreme Court opening, even in in their private conversations with Democratic allies, multiple people familiar with the matter said. Biden has long warned them that even a hint of White House pressure on Breyer to retire could backfire, officials said.\n\nBiden has also characterized it as a matter of professional dignity that tenured officials be given space to make their own decisions and announcements on retirement – something some aides ascribe partly to his own age and experience being written off as too old for the presidency.\n\nAmong members of Biden’s senior team, at least one maintains a close connection to Breyer: national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who clerked for the justice in the early 2000s. Sullivan’s wife, Maggie Goodlander, also clerked for Breyer three years ago and the justice attended their wedding on the campus of Yale Law School in 2015.\n\nWhile Breyer informed the White House of his decision last week, according to multiple sources, he also made clear the official letter that traditionally launches the process would be forthcoming. Without that letter in hand – and Breyer’s own words framing his decision – Biden and his aides declined to address the decision after the news broke Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBut that didn’t mean the process wasn’t already kicking into gear. The White House had already begun informing Democratic senators of Breyer’s decision, according to one source familiar with the calls to Capitol Hill.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/larry-kudlow-bidens-policies-appeasement-not-deterrence', 'Headline': ""LARRY KUDLOW: Biden's policies are about appeasement, not deterrence"", 'Snippet': ""I think one reason Mr. Biden's foreign policy approval ratings have fallen to rock bottom is that he avoids a realistic picture of the world scene.

The United States is a democracy. It\'s a free country.\n\nChina is a communist country – not a democracy. It is totalitarian and repressive and it is most certainly not a free country. Joe Biden pretends not to notice this, but I think that\'s a big mistake. Americans are noticing it pretty well. I think one reason Mr. Biden\'s foreign policy approval ratings have fallen to rock bottom is that he avoids a realistic picture of the world scene.\n\nMORTGAGE RATES DECLINE FOR 3RD CONSECUTIVE WEEK\n\nEspecially on China – but we also see the same Biden instincts as he tries desperately to avoid conflict with Iran and, of course, his cut and run act in Afghanistan and his failure to deter Russia in Ukraine. The Biden policies are about appeasement, not deterrence. Ronald Reagan\'s policies were about deterrence, not appeasement. Reagan said, ""We win, you lose. Reagan was never bashful about outlining the conflict with the old Soviet Union.\n\nTo my way of thinking, the Biden-Xi meetings were nothing more than a phony photo-op and, of course, Biden refuses to acknowledge that China\'s U.S.- sanction-breaking oil imports from Russia and Iran are financing two major wars against the United States. That is the reality.\n\nA ""stable relationship"" preventing ""misunderstandings"" – to use Biden\'s words – would not include these outright attacks against America and it is so ironic that China is using the very fossil fuels to fight America that Joe Biden and all his greenie minions detest so much.\n\nChina has weaponized fossil fuels. Biden has surrendered. If Donald Trump\'s ""drill, baby, drill"" policies had continued into a second term, the U.S. would be somewhere around 15 or 16 million BPD right now, probably on the way to 18 million in a couple years.\n\nAt that pace, the world oil price would be something around $40 a barrel, not $80 or $100 or even $125 where it was a year and a half ago and if that were the case, then we wouldn\'t particularly care whether China was buying oil from Iran or Russia – it would just be a drop in the bucket.\n\nThis is so much a part of Joe Biden\'s sad tale as president. It\'s not just that the middle class has to pay so much more for energy, food and other necessities, or that real wages continue to decline, and working folks have huge problems affording the Biden economy. It\'s that Biden\'s socialist Green New Deal has enormously empowered China and this is fundamentally unstable.\n\nSo, by the way, is the $350 billion trade deficit, due in large part to China\'s continued unfair trading practices and then comes the greatest irony of all.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt this photo-op in San Francisco, the State Department announces a new era of ""climate cooperation"" with China, but wait a minute!

Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana voting with Republicans in the Senate.\n\n“I just signed this veto because legislation passed by the Congress would put at risk the retirement savings of individuals across the country. They couldn’t take into consideration investments that wouldn’t be impacted by climate, impacted by overpaying executives, and that’s why I decided to veto it – it makes sense to veto it,” Biden said in a video posted to social media Monday afternoon.\n\nBiden is seen signing the veto in the video, taken in the Oval Office earlier Monday.\n\nThe veto makes good on Biden’s frequent promise to veto legislation passed by the GOP-controlled House he disagrees with. Even before Republicans took control of that chamber, Biden often mentioned his ability to nix their priorities. “The good news is I’ll have a veto pen,” he told a group of donors in Chicago just days before November’s midterm elections.\n\nOpponents of the rule could try to override Biden’s veto, but at this point it appears unlikely they could get the two-thirds majority needed in each chamber to do so.\n\nBiden’s first presidential veto reflects the reality of a changed political order in Washington with Republicans now in control of the House after they won back the chamber from Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nPreviously, Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate. Now, the president’s party only has a majority in the Senate.\n\nMost legislation passed by the current GOP-controlled House will not be able to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate. But the resolution to overturn the investment rule only needed a simple majority to pass in the Senate. Republican lawmakers advanced it under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to roll back regulations from the executive branch without needing to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate that is necessary for most legislation.\n\nOpponents of the rule have argued that it politicizes retirement investments and that the Biden administration is using it as a way to promote a liberal agenda.\n\nRepublican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said at a news conference earlier this year, “What’s happened here is the woke and weaponized bureaucracy at the Department of Labor has come out with new regulations on retirement funds, and they want retirement funds to be invested in things that are consistent with their very liberal, left-wing agenda.”\n\nSupporters of the rule argue that it is not a mandate – it allows, but does not require, the consideration of environmental, social and governance factors in investment selection.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in defense of the rule that Republicans are “using the same tired attacks we’ve heard for a while now that this is more wokeness. … But Republicans are missing or ignoring an important point: Nothing in the (Labor Department) rule imposes a mandate.”\n\n“This isn’t about ideological preference, it’s about looking at the biggest picture possible for investments to minimize risk and maximize returns,” he said, noting it’s a narrow rule that is “literally allowing the free market to do its work.”\n\nThe statement of administration policy warning that Biden would veto the measure if presented with it similarly states, “the 2022 rule is not a mandate – it does not require any fiduciary to make investment decisions based solely on ESG factors. The rule simply makes sure that retirement plan fiduciaries must engage in a risk and return analysis of their investment decisions and recognizes that these factors can be relevant to that analysis.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/white-house-reaction-breyer-retirement/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden and Breyer will hold event at White House on Thursday ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer are scheduled to appear together at the White House on Thursday as the 83-year-old justice is set to announce his retirement, a source ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer are scheduled to appear together at the White House on Thursday as the 83-year-old justice is set to announce his retirement, a source familiar with the plan tells CNN.\n\nBreyer conveyed to the White House last week that he planned to step down from the court, but he did not tell Biden directly.

With the 2022 midterm elections on the horizon and a myriad of policy battles playing out in Washington, the confirmation of a liberal justice could be the major win Democrats need to fire up their base this November.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters during a news briefing on Wednesday that Biden “has stated and reiterated his commitment to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court and certainly stands by that.” But she had no additional details or statements about the news of Breyer’s retirement.\n\nBreyer will be leaving the high court after two decades on the bench, and Biden’s pick to replace him is expected be a younger, fellow liberal who could serve on the court for decades. It’ll be the President’s first chance to nominate someone to the high court.\n\nWhile confirmation timelines vary, Democrats have signaled thus far that a prospective Supreme Court justice’s confirmation process would take place swiftly if Biden put forward a nominee. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday vowed that a Biden nominee will be confirmed with “all deliberate speed.”\n\nThe confirmation of justices typically takes months. But during the last Supreme Court vacancy, Republicans, as they were barreling toward the 2020 election, pushed through Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination in less than a month.\n\nDespite confirmation delays over the course of Biden’s first year in office, Senate Democrats are confident that a Supreme Court nominee will receive enough votes to get confirmed, according to senior Democratic sources.\n\nThe President also declined to weigh in on the news of Breyer’s retirement from the court on Wednesday, deferring to Breyer, personally, for any news.\n\n“Every justice has the right to decide what he or she is going to do, and announce that on their own,” Biden said. “There’s been no announcement from Justice Breyer. Let him make whatever statement he is going to make, and I’ll be happy to talk about it later.”\n\nBiden had said throughout his 2020 presidential campaign that he was committed to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court if elected.\n\n“I (have) committed that, if I’m elected as president and have the opportunity to appoint someone to the courts, I’ll appoint the first Black woman to the court. It’s required that they have representation now — it’s long overdue,” Biden said in March 2020.\n\nA short list of potential nominees had been circulating Washington well before Breyer’s retirement plans became public, and officials in the White House Counsel’s Office built files on various candidates in anticipation of a potential vacancy.\n\nNames on the list include: DC Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, South Carolina US District Judge J. Michelle Childs, North Carolina Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, Minnesota US District Judge Wilhelmina “Mimi” Wright, Circuit Judge Eunice Lee, Circuit Judge Candace Jackson-Akiwumi and Sherrilyn Ifill, a civil rights attorney who recently announced plans to step down from her role as president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\nOn Wednesday, Psaki declined to comment on rumors that Vice President Kamala Harris could be considered for a Supreme Court vacancy. However, she reiterated that the President has every intention on “running for reelection with Vice President Harris on the ticket as his partner.”\n\nThe prospective nomination of a Black woman to the high court is also a chance for Biden to make amends to progressives for his previous handling of Supreme Court nominations while serving in the Senate.\n\nAs a senator, Biden presided over six Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including Robert Bork’s failed nomination. Biden was the senator in charge of shepherding Breyer’s nomination process as well.\n\nMost notable, however, was Biden’s role presiding over the confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas when the then-Delaware senator was the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearings for Thomas’ nomination included Anita Hill’s testimony alleging that Thomas, who was her boss at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, had sexually harassed her.\n\nIn 2019, as Biden was preparing for a presidential run, he said he regretted that he didn’t give Hill, a Black woman, the “hearing she deserved.”\n\nHe said that hearing would have been one “where she was respected, where the tone of the questioning was not hostile and insulting.” Instead, he said, “she paid a terrible price – she was abused through the hearing, she was taken advantage of, her reputation was attacked.”\n\nBiden also acknowledged the racial dynamics at play, saying there was a “real and perceived problem the committee faced: There were a bunch of white guys” on the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for Hill’s testimony.\n\nAs a result of that dynamic, he said, “She faced a committee that didn’t fully understand what the hell it was all about.”\n\nLater that year, Biden had a conversation with Hill in which he shared “his regret for what she endured.”\n\nHill, in an interview with The New York Times, declined to call the conversation an apology and said she thought Biden failed to grasp the damage he did to her and other victims of sexual harassment.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/09/14/1199461671/the-last-politician-author-shares-stories-behind-bidens-successes-and-failures', 'Headline': ""'The Last Politician' author shares stories behind Biden's ... - NPR"", 'Snippet': ""Atlantic writer Franklin Foer initially saw Biden as a bloviator who fetishized bipartisanship; he's since come to appreciate Biden's ability to empathize with opponents and get legislation passed."", 'Full_text': 'TERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I\'m Terry Gross. When Franklin Foer started his book about the first two years of the Biden administration, he says he shared the Washington establishment\'s skepticism of the man and thought Biden dangerously fetishized bipartisanship. But Foer goes on to say, with a slight cooling of the political climate, bipartisan-minded senators passed a raft of legislation confirming Biden\'s instincts that creaky institutions could be rendered functional.\n\nNow, coinciding with the publication of the book, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has launched an impeachment inquiry into whether Biden helped his son Hunter profit in foreign business dealings and if President Biden himself profited from those dealings, too. Investigations have revealed no evidence that this is true. The White House called the action extreme politics at its worst. We\'re going to talk about the attempt to impeach Biden, the stories behind his biggest successes and failures and the debate over whether he\'s too old to run for a second term. Foer\'s new book is called ""The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden\'s White House And The Struggle For America\'s Future."" Foer is a staff writer at The Atlantic. During the administration of the twice-impeached President Trump, Foer investigated connections between Trump, his presidential campaign and Russia and wrote about the Mueller investigation. We recorded this interview yesterday.\n\nFranklin Foer, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Congratulations on your new book. So you say that, you know, Biden, when he became president, he set out to prove that politics was the way out of this political mess that we\'ve been in. That through coalition building and deal-making, he could find a way out. And he did manage to pass some, you know, pretty heavy-duty legislation. But now, Congressman McCarthy, the speaker of the House, has opened an impeachment inquiry into Biden. So you have sources inside the Biden administration. What is the reaction inside, and what do they plan to - how do they plan to handle this?\n\nFRANKLIN FOER: Well, this is a blatantly political act. And impeachment has become this normalized part of American politics at this stage. It\'s a cycle that\'s repeated fairly endlessly. One of the things that Republicans have struggled to do with Joe Biden during the last campaign and during the first couple years of his administration was to slap him with some sort of tag that stuck. They failed to define him in the negative sort of way that they\'re usually quite good at doing to their political opponents. And so, belatedly, you know, in anticipation of this campaign, they\'ve launched this two-pronged attack on Joe Biden.\n\nOne prong is to portray him as Sleepy Joe, this character who is hardly compos mentis who is dancing on the strings of some puppet masters, apparently. And then the second prong of attack is to portray him as corrupt because of his association - I mean, it\'s more than an association - because of his son, Hunter Biden, and his business dealings. And this is an important line of attack for the Republicans because it plays into the sort of populism that Donald Trump has always tried to cultivate around himself, the sense that his enemies are corrupt members of the swamp. And of course, it\'s also its own form of what about-ism. That by depicting Hunter Biden in this sort of way and depicting Joe Biden in this sort of way, it blunts all of the indictments, all of these things that are hanging over Donald Trump. Never mind that there are 90-some-odd counts against him versus this one thing where there\'s not even hard evidence attaching to the president of the United States. But this is now the political battle that Joe Biden confronts.\n\nGROSS: Do you know anything about how the White House plans to deal with this impeachment inquiry?\n\nFOER: You know, my sense is that there is this hope that Republicans will go through the same cycle that they went through with the Bill Clinton impeachment and with a lot of the attacks against Barack Obama that even Kevin McCarthy seems to sense this, that they\'re opening up a Pandora\'s box here, and that if they let things go, there is going to be this overreach and independent voters in the middle will backlash against it.\n\nGROSS: All right. So apparently, according to The New York Times, Trump has been talking to the Freedom Caucus about impeachment and to Marjorie Taylor Greene, who had already introduced articles of impeachment in Congress. Do you see this as trying to overthrow the election by other means? Because Trump was active in trying to change the results of the election, and he\'s been indicted for conspiracy for trying to do that. So do you think - see this as another way of trying to do the same thing?\n\nFOER: I think it\'s a bit late in the day to even mess around with those sorts of plays, given how close we are to the next election. And also, the Senate is never going to convict Joe Biden on any of this stuff. It\'s hard to imagine that they can even get this through the House without imperiling blue state Republicans. So I think this is more a political ploy than something that\'s tethered to all those other nefarious attempts to overthrow democracy.\n\nGROSS: So you\'re saying Republicans don\'t really believe that Biden will be impeached?\n\nFOER: Yeah. I think they\'re kind of - they\'re going through the motions in order to build a message headed into the 2024 election.\n\nGROSS: Meanwhile, government shutdown is on the line if the budget deal isn\'t passed, I think, by the end of the month. What do you think the impeachment process means for the budget deal\'s chances?\n\nFOER: Well, it\'s pretty clear that these two processes are interconnected, that Kevin McCarthy would prefer to avoid a government shutdown because he knows that his party will get blamed for that. And in order to placate the Freedom Caucus and the Matt Gaetzes and the Marjorie Taylor Greenes in his party, he\'s assented to go forward with impeachment, even though I think he could probably see some of the political perils there, as well.\n\nGROSS: Joe Biden will be 81 in November. Do you think a lot of Democrats believe he\'s too old to serve a second term but are afraid to say so? Because he doesn\'t have any serious challengers within the Democratic Party right now, for whatever reason. And do you think Democrats are afraid of speaking about Biden\'s age because they\'re afraid of what would happen if Trump won or DeSantis or other Republicans from the far right?\n\nFOER: There\'s something strange that\'s happening with the age question, because on the one hand, questions about his age are obviously incredibly valid and important questions to be asked just as a matter of governing. You want the president of the United States to be somebody who\'s in tip-top mental shape. And then on the other hand, you can see the way in which the age question is falling into a continuum with Donald Trump\'s own mental acuity questions. And the way that the media has begun to talk about the age question, it\'s as if Biden\'s age is on the same spectrum as Trump\'s mental acuity issues.\n\nAnd they\'re very, very different sorts of things because Joe Biden\'s age, you know, there\'s two components to it. There is the question, does he have the ability to actually do the job of governing, and does he have the energy to actually govern? And I think what I tried to document in my book based on my reporting is that he\'s had actually a very energetic first term, even if that doesn\'t convey to the public in the most palpable sorts of ways. But then there\'s the political question, which is very different, which is how do voters perceive Joe Biden? Is his age an issue to them connecting with his political successes? Does he have the energy to run a political campaign? And I think that\'s a little bit more of an open question for me.\n\nGROSS: And I think - and honestly, I think a lot of people are wondering, can anybody in their 80s - and he\'ll be - like, if he\'s reelected, he\'ll be in his mid-80s by the time his term is over. Can anybody at that age really endure the stresses and the travel and, you know, the impossible-to-solve problems that a president has to deal with when, basically, the whole world is on their shoulders?\n\nFOER: Yeah, a totally fair question, and I think it\'s one where everybody brings their own experience, their own baggage to the question. Every one of us has parents or grandparents who have aged. And it\'s hard not to see Joe Biden through that filter. And also, you know, people age differently. And that\'s why I don\'t especially enjoy being a pundit having to talk about Joe Biden\'s aging, because I\'m not a gerontologist. And I can\'t predict what Joe Biden specifically will look like in - you know, by the time he\'s in his mid-80s.\n\nGROSS: And nobody can.\n\nFOER: Right. And it\'s also, aging is not - it\'s not linear. It\'s not like we reach a threshold point where there\'s a human sell-by date and we\'re no longer able to do certain basic things. We have traits that change as we age. Our energy levels change as we age. There are certain people for whom work is almost an antidote to the whole process of aging. And there\'s a flip side to all of these questions about energy and acuity, which is that there\'s also real wisdom that comes from having been around the block and having relationships with leaders. And that\'s the harder part to sell politically because a lot of that stuff happens out of public view.\n\nGROSS: I\'m wondering if you have any insights or direct knowledge of why Biden thinks that he should run for a second term at his age, knowing that the public, that ardent Democrats would have questions about his age, let alone Republicans trying to use that, to exploit that to their advantage.\n\nFOER: Yeah, the interesting counterfactual is to imagine, what would he have done absent Donald Trump\'s decision to run in 2024? I think that Trump\'s running again, in Biden\'s mind, simplified the decision, that he views himself as the dragon slayer, that he is the one who figured out how to beat Trump in 2020 and that he\'s uniquely able to do that again in 2024. And, you know, maybe there\'s a bit of self-myth there about the indispensability of Joe Biden in that regard. I think that he also knows that there is safety in familiarity, that, you know, right now, it\'s easy to wish-cast that there be another, younger, more energetic version of Joe Biden running for president or somebody who was a fresh alternative to Joe Biden.\n\nBut you can\'t guarantee what happens in a Democratic primary. You can\'t be sure what issues get raised in the course of a Democratic primary. Or you can\'t be sure what ill feelings are left after a Democratic primary. I mean, the Hillary Clinton-Bernie Sanders primary in 2016 was a really bruising thing. And that primary fight arguably left Hillary Clinton weaker in the 2016 election. So the counterfactuals are powerful, but it is hard to know what the alternative would actually look like.\n\nGROSS: You write in your book that you initially saw Joe Biden as a bloviator who dangerously fetishized bipartisanship, but then he renewed your respect for politicians. What changed your mind about him?\n\nFOER: I got to see him up close. And there\'s a - you know, the profession of politician is one that is - our culture has very, very little respect for. When I was a kid, one of the first jokes I learned was about a guy walking into a used brain shop. And the most expensive brain there was the politician\'s because it was hardly ever used. And there\'s this artificiality to the politician. Joe Biden tells these stories that just seem kind of cornball to me. I mean, aesthetically, I\'m not - I\'ve never been attracted to Joe Biden as a political figure.\n\nBut watching him up close and watching what a politician who\'s very, very good at understanding the minds of the people he\'s sitting across the table from - and knowing how to take this empathy that everybody, I think, attributes to him and applying it to foreign leaders and applying it to politicians, and knowing how to bring them to yes, how to get them to assent to deals - that\'s a real skill. There\'s a lot of real technique there that I came to see as very effective and very admirable.\n\nGROSS: Can you give us an example of that? You know, I\'m not sure that empathy would come in that handy dealing with someone like Putin, but where did you see it really come in as a powerful tool?\n\nFOER: Well, I mean, the Putin thing is actually an interesting example unto itself because on the second day of his administration, he got a call from Vladimir Putin. And it was an unexpected call. And a lot of his advisers urged him not to take it because Putin had meddled in the 2016 election. He\'d meddled some in the 2020 election. They felt like he could just wait his place in line. And Biden\'s attitude was, no. When, you know, a leader of a nuclear nation calls you, you take the call. And Biden thought about Putin\'s emotional, psychological makeup. And he went back, and he revisited in his own head how Obama had treated Putin. And he described Russia as a declining power.\n\nAnd Biden\'s attitude was, you know, there\'s a very high likelihood Putin\'s going to engage in mischief over the course of my presidency. I can\'t predict what it\'s going to be, but there\'s no doubt that he\'ll do something to try to derail me. What\'s the best way I can deal with him in order to prevent that from happening? And so he decided that he needed to both show him signs of respect, that he still thought of Russia as a great power, and while simultaneously telegraphing to Putin in a very, very clear sort of way that if you do bad things, there\'s going to be consequences. And so when he first decided to meet with Putin, he didn\'t want to do it on the fringes of another gathering of global leaders. He wanted to create a scene that resembled some of the superpower meetings of the past. So he decided to have the meeting in Geneva, where it was a tete-a-tete between the two of them. And, of course, that didn\'t work out in the end. But I just tell this story in order to highlight the way that he goes about thinking through a problem like Vladimir Putin.\n\nGROSS: Well, we need to take a short break here. So let me reintroduce you. If you\'re just joining us, my guest is Franklin Foer. He\'s a staff writer for The Atlantic and author of the new book ""The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden\'s White House And The Struggle For America\'s Future."" We\'ll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let\'s get back to my interview with Atlantic staff writer Franklin Foer, author of the new book ""The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden\'s White House And The Struggle For America\'s Future."" So you mentioned in the book Biden\'s almost fetishistic belief in bipartisanship. We\'re living in a time where there\'s very little bipartisanship. But Biden did manage to pass some important bills. What do you think are his most important legislative achievements in terms of the direct impact they\'re likely to have on the lives of American people?\n\nFOER: So he passed a clutch of legislation, each of which you could make a case for its significance on its own, the most important of which, I think, is the Inflation Reduction Act, which is going to significantly trim American carbon emissions, that it supercharges the transition to green energy. But one of the things that I think is important about this legislation is that it compounds.\n\nSo you have the infrastructure bill, which was passed in a bipartisan sort of way, the CHIPS Act, which makes investments in the American semiconductor industry and in scientific research. And then you have the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes these investments in batteries and solar and other alternative energies. And those investments are being coordinated so that they can compound, so that you have supply chains which may not have formed on their own, absent government directing this money, coordinating the investment so that those businesses that are taking advantage of this money exist in geographic proximity to one another, and so that each step in the supply chains, which are very, very intricate, snap into place.\n\nAnd as a result, you have all of this capital that had been sitting on the sidelines now rushing into American manufacturing. You have the emersion of something that they call the battery belt happening in the American South that\'s going to make the transition to green energy happen so much faster than anybody had actually initially anticipated. One of the fascinating wrinkles of the Inflation Reduction Act is - it was a bill that was negotiated with Senator Joe Manchin. And one of the things that I think Manchin didn\'t understand in the moment and is now quite sour about is that there is no cap to the amount of money that the American government can spend subsidizing green energy, spending on tax credits. And so the Congressional Budget Office had initially anticipated that there would be $370 billion spent on clean energy, and it\'s probably going to end up somewhere in the ballpark of $1 trillion. And that\'s why everything is happening so much faster. There\'s so much money there for companies to be incentivized to move in this greener direction.\n\nGROSS: As a senator, Biden was known as somebody who could, you know, count heads, know when legislation could pass, know how to make compromise deals to get legislation passed. So how did he use those skills in the legislation that you\'ve been talking about to get those bills passed? Because, like, some of that credit goes to congressional leaders.\n\nFOER: Absolutely.\n\nGROSS: And some of the credit goes to Biden. So give us an example of what Biden did.\n\nFOER: Passing Biden\'s legislative agenda with a one-vote margin in the Senate was something that required a lot of political tact. He had to bring along the left to agree to bipartisan things. He had to bring along moderate senators who didn\'t want to do left things. And, of course, it all exploded at one moment in December when Manchin pulled the plug on supporting the Biden agenda. And the hardest thing at that moment was for Biden to shelve his ego and to let somebody else do this thing that he loved most, which was negotiating with senators. In the end, it shocked the world when they were able to get Manchin to yes, to agree to that massive amount of spending on green energy.\n\nGROSS: Do you mean Schumer took over the negotiation with Manchin?\n\nFOER: Yeah, exactly.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, it\'s time for another break, so let me reintroduce you. My guest is Franklin Foer. He\'s a staff writer for The Atlantic and author of the new book ""The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden\'s White House And The Struggle For America\'s Future."" We\'ll be right back after a short break. I\'m Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I\'m Terry Gross. Let\'s get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Franklin Foer, author of the new book ""The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden\'s White House And The Struggle For America\'s Future."" During the Trump Administration, Franklin Foer investigated ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. He also wrote about the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe U.S. has become such an ally of Ukraine during Ukraine\'s war with Russia - we\'re supplying arms, were supplying intelligence - but Biden has such a contrast with Zelenskyy. Biden is a lifelong politician. Zelenskyy is a former comic and sitcom star who got elected just in time to lead his country in war. Biden is 81, Zelenskyy is 45. Zelenskyy uses social media to get public support and is very charismatic. You wouldn\'t call - you\'d call Biden very politically savvy, but not necessarily charismatic, not the king of social media. And their relationship got off to a pretty bad start. What caused it to get off to such a bad start?\n\nFOER: Well, Zelenskyy first came to the White House in September of 2021. And he had - he was a traumatized figure. He\'d just been through the Trump impeachment saga, where his phone call had become the source of controversy. And he didn\'t fully understand the ways in which American politics worked. And so I think he brought a lot of baggage to that meeting, started to demand all of these things of Joe Biden that Biden thought was - that Biden thought were implausible. And so Biden took a very dismissive attitude towards Zelenskyy at the start.\n\nGROSS: What was Zelenskyy asking for?\n\nFOER: He wanted NATO membership, which is something that Ukraine has always asked for. But there was a moment in the conversation where he started to be very dismissive of NATO after Biden told him that it wasn\'t plausible that he could get NATO membership for Ukraine in the short term. And Biden didn\'t really like the emotional tenor of Zelenskyy\'s case.\n\nGROSS: And is that when Zelenskyy said, you know, NATO - like, France and Germany are going to be pulling out of NATO?\n\nFOER: (Laughter) Yes. Yeah, exactly.\n\nGROSS: What made him say that?\n\nFOER: I think he just got frustrated. And at various points in the course of the Ukraine war, various American public officials, whether it\'s the CIA director or the secretary of state and the secretary of defense, have had to talk to Zelenskyy to kind of coach him through his relationship with Joe Biden, because Zelenskyy has his own - not just style, but his own national security needs. And it\'s understandable that he would be extremely emotional about them.\n\nHis country is teetering on the brink. It needs weapons in order to survive. And so he\'d like to address Joe Biden by just reading him these long lists of demands. And that never went - that never sat very well with Joe Biden, who has his own, I think, interests as the president of the United States. I mean, he\'s a child of the Cold War. Biden\'s always super worried about the prospects of the war escalating. He\'s worried about the dangers of a nuclear Russia and what they might do if they feel cornered. And so they\'re working towards a common interest, but they\'re asking very, very different questions.\n\nGROSS: How did the relationship between Zelenskyy and Biden end up improving?\n\nFOER: Well, the arms just kept coming to Ukraine. And there was a logic to the way that the U.S. was arming Ukraine. It wasn\'t just giving them everything that they wanted, but it was helping them plan the weapons deliveries in the context of a changing military plan. And for all of Zelenskyy\'s understandable frustrations with the Biden administration, I think it is pretty clear to him and to the world that the United States has made a tremendous financial investment in the Ukrainian war and that there\'s been a political investment made in waging - in supporting the Ukrainian side, that there are higher gas prices in this country because of the war, that Western publics have suffered. And it\'s a tremendous act of solidarity.\n\nGROSS: I want to ask you about abortion in the post-Dobbs world. Now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade and now it\'s up to states to decide abortion laws, and abortion has been outlawed in some states, women have to travel far distances. And Republicans - some Republicans seem to be doing everything in their power to make abortion access impossible. Biden is Catholic. The church, of course, is opposed to abortion. How would you describe his position on abortion now?\n\nFOER: Well, it\'s evolved. As it was clear to the world that Dobbs was coming down the pike, there were all sorts of discussions within the administration about how to respond. And I think Biden initially was tormented. He didn\'t fully appreciate the radicalism of the Dobbs decision. I think that he was thinking about abortion both through the lens of his own Catholicism and knowing that he was going to get reprimanded by the leaders of his own church for that decision. But I think he was also thinking about abortion as a culture war issue from the 1980s and 1990s, where, you know, all of these debates were happening about third-term abortions and the like.\n\nIt felt like the center of the country was as conflicted as he was about the abortion issue. And I think he struggled initially to appreciate just how sweeping Dobbs is and just how radical the right has become on this issue. And it\'s one of the ironies of the Biden administration that this issue where he has a lot of personal ambivalence and has had to kind of think his way through the issue and to adapt his own personal morality on the issue is actually the thing that offers him the greatest political hope going into the next election, because so many Americans are afraid and angry about the trajectory of sexual freedom in this country.\n\nGROSS: Roe v. Wade was based on a woman\'s right to privacy. And a woman\'s right to privacy should allow her to choose to have an abortion, a very private matter. But when Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the Dobbs decision, he objected to it being based on the right to privacy. And that\'s one of the reasons why Dobbs was overturned, perhaps the primary reason. And something that really disturbed Biden was Clarence Thomas\' concurrence with the majority decision. And Clarence Thomas wrote, in future cases, we should reconsider all of this court\'s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence and Obergefell. And those are the decisions that use the right to privacy to overturn laws against birth control, gay sex, you know, gay marriage. Why did that really disturb Biden?\n\nFOER: Well, privacy was an issue that he talked a lot about in the 1980s when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And it was his initial frame for understanding the radicalism of it. As somebody who was personally conflicted about the issue of abortion, it was easier for him to think about the decision in that broader context of privacy. But I think he still wasn\'t convincing in explaining this to the nation. His speech that he delivered right after the Dobbs decision was released was widely panned because it just didn\'t look like he had his heart in it. And it took him about two weeks to get to the place where he could speak convincingly about Dobbs. And it was really because it took him that long to understand all of the radical implications of it. And there was this case of a 10-year-old girl - that I\'m sure your listeners remember - who was from Ohio, who had to go to Indianapolis in order to get an abortion after she\'d been raped. And then the law fell on her. And I think Biden saw that, and it was an easy morality tale for him to latch on to. And then you could see him talk about Dobbs in this very, very passionate sort of way.\n\nGROSS: So what has Biden done and what is in his power to do to make abortion more accessible for women post-Dobbs?\n\nFOER: In the weeks that followed the Dobbs decision, there were executive orders and executive actions that protected the right of women to travel out of state in order to get abortions. They protected the drug mifepristone, which is used to manage and treat miscarriages. But his analysis has always been that there\'s a limit to what a president can do on their own in order to protect the right to abortion, that this is going to require a political response, that it\'s going to require the Congress passing laws. It\'s going to require changing the composition of the Supreme Court, which requires voters to elect Democrats who will install justices who could ultimately reverse Roe. And so his instinct has been rather than testing the limits of executive power to ensure access to abortion, that it\'s better to allow Republicans to own the issue and that the only solution will come when the public recognizes that Republicans are solely responsible for the collapse of this right.\n\nGROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you again. If you\'re just joining us, my guest is Franklin Foer, author of the new book ""The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden\'s White House And The Struggle For America\'s Future."" We\'ll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CHARLIE HADEN\'S ""EL CIEGO (THE BLIND)"")\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let\'s get back to my interview with Franklin Foer, author of the new book ""The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden\'s White House And The Struggle For America\'s Future."" He\'s a staff writer for The Atlantic.\n\nSo I want to change the topic to Afghanistan, which was seen as a real fiasco, you know, when America pulled out of Afghanistan, officially ending the war. There was a conflict then between, you know, the military leaders and the State Department. The military wanted to pull out as soon as possible because Biden had already said we\'re pulling out, we\'re ending this. And the military was worried that the longer it\'d take - it took for the U.S. to pull out, the harder it would be to get out. Whereas the State Department wanted to stay and wanted to have the time to protect its own people and the people from Afghanistan who\'d worked closely with it. So that was the conflict, or at least one of the conflicts. How did Biden position himself between the military and the State Department, which wanted conflicting things?\n\nFOER: He tended to defer to his military leaders on all of these questions. Belatedly, the administration had reconsidered the idea of keeping Bagram Airfield - which was the largest air base that we had in the country - open in the course of August in order to facilitate removal of people in order to give the Afghan government their best shot at hanging on. But Lloyd Austin, the secretary of defense, had actually run Bagram Air Base, and he said that that was not a plausible policy for the administration to take. And so you did have the State and the Defense Department kind of out of sync in terms of their policy priorities. But I\'m not sure that that was actually the biggest problem at the end of the day.\n\nI mean, the biggest problem, I think, goes back to the way that the decision was formulated and Biden\'s priorities in the course of planning the Afghan withdrawal. I mean, his desire was to rip the Band-Aid off, to end this chapter in American foreign policy, to end the longest war in American history, because he did not like the idea that soldiers like his late son, Beau, were being sent to this country in the name of a fruitless cause. And in the course of prioritizing that, I think he didn\'t really think long and hard about the humanitarian consequences of his decision and didn\'t elevate the planning of a humanitarian evacuation in the event of the Afghan government collapsing.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. So pulling out ended up being a fiasco. However, you say that that part was a fiasco, but at the same time, once the decision was made to pull out, once the Biden administration saw the chaos, it managed to pull together a more strategic plan to get people out of Afghanistan. Can you talk about that a little bit and how the Biden administration managed to figure out a plan where planes took off, like, every 45 minutes carrying people outside of Afghanistan?\n\nFOER: Right. So you have these terrible scenes coming from Kabul. You have this especially terrible image of a young man falling from a C-17 plane that\'s leaving, plummeting from the sky.\n\nGROSS: Because he was so desperate to get out.\n\nFOER: Exactly. He was clinging to - he was in the wheel well of the plane.\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nFOER: And Biden, having seen this level of humanitarian desperation and absorbing all of these political blows that he\'s taking from his own party, from the Republicans, from media, decides that no plane is going to leave Hamid Karzai International Airport empty. And so every C-17 that\'s flying into the airport is then filled with refugees. And taking those refugees out of Afghanistan required an incredible amount of improvisation. They needed to be housed. They needed to be fed. They needed an ultimate destination.\n\nAnd so we ended up - the United States government ended up negotiating with governments in the Gulf and in Europe in order to create what they described as lily pads, which were these temporary dormitories where refugees would be housed and processed until they were taken to their ultimate destination. And so one of the kind of perverse ironies of the debacle at Kabul was that because things went as badly as they went, there was this willingness, even among Republicans, to get refugees out of the country. And so in this moment, the U.S. ended up extracting 124,000 refugees in a matter of weeks, which was an incredible act of improvisation.\n\nGROSS: One of the things I found most interesting in your chapter about the U.S. exit from Afghanistan was Hillary Clinton\'s role in it. Hillary knew a lot of the women in Afghanistan who had taken leadership positions on women\'s rights and employment for women. And she got access to - she was leaked what was called a kill list of 125 women who were targeted for assassination. And she wanted to get them out. And she did some very creative things to do that - I think too complicated for us to get into the full story. But the part that I found just really fascinating was there was a whole plan in effect for a lot of these women to temporarily be flown to Albania. But they didn\'t have visas from Albania, and the Taliban were preventing these women from leaving unless they had a visa. So talk about the plan that people came up with to get around that.\n\nFOER: Right. So Hillary had set up a network of safe houses. She\'d hired military contractors. She\'d procured planes from foreign governments in order to get women out. And so they were stuck in this position. And one of the women from Hillary\'s - one of the Hillary-affiliated NGOs was in Albania and working with the government. And in order to make the document convincing enough for the Taliban, they took a picture of a QR code off of a bag of potato chips, which they stuck into the PDF that they forwarded to the women in Afghanistan. So they were doing whatever they could in these desperate circumstances to try to just make it work so that these women got out.\n\nGROSS: So the bar code looked like, yeah, visas have stuff like that. So...\n\nFOER: Yeah. That looks very official.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. I guess the Taliban didn\'t have a way of translating what the barcode said.\n\nFOER: Right. Well, you have the Taliban, who are peasants who\'d been fighting in the countryside who suddenly were in Kabul for the first time, having to make these decisions about who to get out. So something that was plausible-looking was probably going to work.\n\nGROSS: I just want to say about Hillary Clinton - she no longer had an official government role or an official government responsibility to help women get out of Afghanistan. But she did remarkable things to get them out.\n\nFOER: And she did it in ways that put her at cross purposes with the Biden administration. That national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who was a protege of Hillary Clinton\'s, called her to reprimand her for having called the Zelenskyy government in Ukraine to try to get a Ukrainian transport plane to take these women out of the country. And in the end, there were a thousand women in Albania who were able to escape the Taliban because of Hillary Clinton\'s work.\n\nGROSS: Was this a public story before you wrote about it?\n\nFOER: It wasn\'t. In the course of doing my reporting about Afghanistan, I would hear these stories about how the White House was talking about the Hillary Clinton groups. And I would hear people in the NGO world who would talk about how they\'d called Hillary Clinton in order to get help. And so I just - I followed the scent there. And I think she was reluctant to talk about this or claim credit for it because I don\'t think that she wanted especially to embarrass the Biden administration.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Franklin Foer, author of the new book ""The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden\'s White House And The Struggle For America\'s Future."" This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF YO LA TENGO\'S ""WEATHER SHY"")\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let\'s get back to my interview that we recorded yesterday with Franklin Foer, author of the new book ""The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden\'s White House And The Struggle For America\'s Future."" He\'s a staff writer for The Atlantic.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, you investigated ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. You wrote about the Mueller report, and before that, the Mueller investigation. And you wrote extensively about Paul Manafort, a former campaign manager for Trump who\'s now doing time in prison. The Mueller report didn\'t fundamentally change things within the Trump administration. Now, you might disagree with that, so say so if you disagree.\n\nFOER: No, it didn\'t change anything within the Trump administration at all. So, no, I don\'t disagree.\n\nGROSS: And now Trump is indicted in Georgia on conspiracy to overturn the election. He\'s indicted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for conspiring to subvert American democracy. I wonder what it\'s like to witness now, after the presidency, efforts to hold Trump to account.\n\nFOER: I continue to think that this is the most important thing in American life, that there was lawlessness that happened at industrial scale. There was an attempt to fraudulently subvert an American election. I think that we can\'t afford to sweep these things under the rug or allow political calculation to cause us to avert our eyes from them. And right now, we\'re in an especially painful moment, I think, where Trump\'s numbers in the polls look really great because he, in effect, is running some version of the basement strategy from 2020. I mean, there\'s a way in which we\'re not being exposed to full bore Donald Trump right now because he\'s communicating with very fringe outlets. He\'s not on Twitter. He\'s not giving interviews to mainstream media.\n\nAnd so it feels as if the country isn\'t fully internalizing exactly everything that we\'re learning in the course of all of these indictments. And it feels as if he\'s somehow profiting corruptly again from the fact that he\'s being held to account. But I think this is really a moment in time. And I don\'t know if I can predict politically what\'s going to happen here, how this is all going to turn. But I think that we\'re, in a way, in the most painful moment of it.\n\nGROSS: Why do you consider it to be the most painful moment?\n\nFOER: Because he seems to be getting away with it politically.\n\nGROSS: You mean among his base and voters.\n\nFOER: Among voters, right, that he - you know, I think that it\'s just an incredible fact that a guy who is being indicted for all of these things, and when the case against him is so crystalline in so many sort of ways, that he would be tied with Biden in national polls, with all of the caveats that we need to insert there about how it\'s still early in the election and it\'s state polls that matter and all these things that are kind of trite pieces of political wisdom. The fact is is that having been exposed to everything about Donald Trump and having the justice system start to actually formally hold him to account for these sorts of things, politically, he\'s still quite strong.\n\nGROSS: Well, Franklin Foer, thank you so much for coming back to FRESH AIR.

In the Asia ...', 'Full_text': 'For over 20 years, Pew Research Center has tracked international public opinion of world leaders, including the U.S. president. In his second year in office, Joe Biden receives generally positive ratings in the countries surveyed by the Center. In most of these places, Biden’s ratings are higher than those of his predecessor in the White House, Donald Trump, but lower than his own ratings in 2021.\n\nHere are six charts on what people in surveyed countries think of Biden, based on polls conducted in each nation in the spring of 2022.\n\nA median of 58% of adults across 18 countries say they have confidence in Joe Biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs.\n\nConfidence in Biden varies widely by region and country. In Europe alone, the share of adults who offer a positive rating of Biden ranges from 82% in Poland to just under a third (31%) in Hungary. In the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea and Japan stand out with 70% and 62% of adults, respectively, saying they have confidence in the U.S. president. Opinion is more divided in Malaysia, Australia and Singapore.\n\nIn Israel, six-in-ten adults say they have confidence in Biden, though fewer than half attach positive descriptors to him like “strong leader” (41% say this about him), “caring about ordinary people” (36%) and “charismatic” (27%).\n\nConfidence in Biden has dropped significantly in most places surveyed in 2021 and 2022. The share of adults who have confidence in Biden on the world stage has decreased by double digits in 13 of the 14 countries surveyed in both years. In Italy, Greece, Spain and Singapore, half or more now have little or no confidence in the U.S. president. Still, in most places – including key European countries – confidence in Biden remains higher than confidence in Trump. Israel is the one exception: While 60% of Israelis have confidence in Biden, 71% said the same about Trump in 2019.\n\nOlder adults generally have more confidence in Biden than younger adults. In most countries surveyed, adults ages 50 and older are more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to have confidence in Biden. For example, nearly three-quarters of Belgians ages 50 and older give Biden positive ratings on the world stage, compared with roughly half of Belgians ages 18 to 29. Double-digit differences also exist in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, South Korea, Sweden, Japan and France.\n\nIn Hungary, Italy and Poland, the opposite pattern appears: Younger adults are more likely than older adults to have confidence in Biden.\n\nThere is more public approval than disapproval of Biden’s choice to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan – but low ratings of the withdrawal itself. A median of 52% of adults across 18 countries surveyed say it was the right decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while 39% say it was the wrong decision. Responses vary by region, and in Poland, Israel, Japan and Hungary, roughly two-in-ten do not offer a response.\n\nAcross all 18 countries, a median of just a third of adults (33%) say the withdrawal was handled well. Far more (median of 56%) say it was not handled well.\n\nAmericans’ views of the decision to withdraw troops, as well as the execution of the plan, are largely aligned with views from around the world. Six-in-ten Americans say it was the right decision, while 38% hold the opposite view. And roughly a third (32%) say the withdrawal was handled well, whereas two-thirds (66%) say it was not.\n\nIn places where the U.S. is seen more favorably, so is Biden. For example, the two countries surveyed where people have the most favorable views of the United States – Poland and South Korea – are also among the countries where people have the most confidence in Biden.\n\nIn nearly all countries surveyed, more people express a favorable view of the U.S. than confidence in Biden – though the opposite is true in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and Malaysia. In Germany and Australia, the share of adults with a positive view of the U.S. and confidence in Biden are roughly the same. This pattern holds at the individual level as well: Favorable views of the U.S. correlate with positive ratings of Biden.\n\nConfidence in Biden is similar to confidence in other Western leaders. A median of 58% of adults across the 18 surveyed countries have confidence in Biden’s handling of global affairs, just a few points lower than the median share who say the same about French President Emmanuel Macron (61%) and equal to positive ratings of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (58%). Larger shares, however, say they are not confident in Biden than say the same of his German counterpart.\n\nWithin specific countries, there are greater differences in ratings of the three leaders. In Poland and Israel, for instance, larger shares are more confident in Biden than either of his European counterparts, while in Greece, it is Macron who receives the highest ratings.'}}",91.5,1

The ...', 'Full_text': 'SciCheck Digest\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials were designed to study the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease, not transmission. But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Still, it appears in all its absurd glory in Paxton\'s lawsuit last week, which seeks $10 million in reparations.\n\nMath argument\n\nBriefly, the lawsuit and the anti-vaccine rhetoric before it argues that Pfizer should have presented its vaccine\'s effectiveness in terms of absolute risk reduction rather than relative risk reduction. Doing so would have made the highly effective COVID-19 vaccine appear extremely ineffective. Based on relative risk reduction in a two-month trial, Pfizer\'s vaccine appeared 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19—as Pfizer advertised. Using the same trial data but calculating absolute risk reduction, however, the vaccine effectiveness would have been 0.85 percent.\n\nThe difference between the two calculations is quite simple: Absolute risk reduction is a matter of subtraction—the percentage point drop in risk of a disease between an untreated and treated group. So, for example, if a group of untreated people have a 60 percent risk of developing a disease, but, when treated, the risk drops to 10 percent, the absolute risk reduction is 50 percent (60 – 10 = 50).\n\nRelative risk reduction involves division—the percent change difference between the two groups\' risks. So, as in the previous example, if a treatment lowers disease risk from 60 percent to 10 percent, the relative risk reduction is 83 percent (50 percent drop / 60 percent initial risk = ~0.83).\n\nBoth numbers can be helpful when weighing the risks and benefits of treatments, but absolute risk reduction is particularly key when there\'s a low risk of a disease. This can be easily understood by simply moving the decimal in the above example. If a treatment lowers a person\'s disease risk from 6 percent to 1 percent, the relative risk reduction is still 83 percent—an impressive number that might argue for treatment—but the absolute risk reduction is a paltry 5 percent—which could easily be negated by any potential side effects or high costs.\n\nCalculation context\n\nSimilar calculations were seen in Pfizer\'s trial: Of 17,411 vaccinated people, eight developed COVID-19 during the trial (0.045 percent), while 162 of 17,511 people in the placebo group developed the infection (0.9 percent). The relative risk reduction is 95 percent, while the absolute risk reduction is a decidedly unimpressive 0.85 percent.\n\nFor this reason, anti-vaccine advocates have seized upon absolute risk calculations as a way to downplay the effectiveness of lifesaving vaccines. But this steamrolls over the reason relative risk is used to examine vaccine effectiveness against infectious disease. Absolute risk is most helpful when it\'s relatively stable and can be confidently calculated, such as calculating the risk of cardiovascular disease in a person, given their blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In these cases, absolute risk reduction is very helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment. But using absolute risk for infectious diseases is often simply nonsensical because absolute risk can vary dramatically by space, time, and many other factors.\n\nFor instance, a person\'s absolute risk of flu drops significantly when it\'s not flu season. Or, if a person hops on a plane, traveling from an area with no endemic malaria directly into an area with a raging malaria outbreak, their absolute risk of infection will skyrocket when they land. And, of course, if people are under lockdowns or health restrictions—as was the case early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Pfizer\'s vaccine trials were running—their absolute risk can rise significantly when those lockdowns and restrictions are lifted—as was the case in 2021 after the vaccine\'s release.\n\nWith absolute risk so variable, relative risk is a more helpful measure of a vaccine\'s effectiveness—and the relative risk reduction applies regardless of what a person\'s absolute risk is at a given point in time.\n\nArtificial numbers\n\nAnother key reason it\'s safe to ignore absolute risk reduction in vaccine trial data is that it is often entirely artificial. These trials are designed to enroll large numbers of people with the full knowledge that only a small percentage will be exposed during the trial. And they\'re designed with trigger points—in other words, when the trial hits a pre-determined number of infections, effectiveness is calculated.\n\nIn Pfizer\'s trial, the trigger point was at or around 170. But, if the trial runners had set the trigger point somewhere else, the absolute risk reduction could easily have been different, even if everything else was the same. For instance, if it was set to 510 and there were 24 cases in the vaccine groups (0.13 percent) and 486 cases in the placebo group (2.8 percent), the relative risk reduction would still be 95 percent, but the absolute risk reduction would be 2.67 percent, not 0.85 percent.\n\nIf Pfizer had waited for all 35,000 or so people in the trial to be exposed to COVID-19 amid widespread lockdowns, it would have needlessly delayed the evaluation and release of the vaccines.\n\nAn analysis from last year estimated that COVID-19 vaccines prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and more than 3 million deaths in the first two years after their release.\n\nIn a statement to Stat, Pfizer noted the benefits and safety of its vaccine, saying that its representations of its vaccine ""have been accurate and science-based. [Pfizer] believes that the state’s case has no merit and will respond to the petition in court in due course.""'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/05/30/fact-check-claim-misinterprets-data-2021-pfizer-report/9898129002/', 'Headline': 'Fact check: Claim misinterprets data from a 2021 Pfizer report - USA TODAY', 'Snippet': 'The claim: A Pfizer trial reports 42,000 adverse events and 1,200 fatalities As health care officials continue to urge Americansto get vaccinated and the coronavirus has led to more than 1 million ...', 'Full_text': 'The claim: A Pfizer trial reports 42,000 adverse events and 1,200 fatalities\n\nAs health care officials continue to urge Americansto get vaccinated and the coronavirus has led to more than 1 million deaths in the U.S., some online posts falsely claim the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine makes people sick and kills them.\n\n""So the leak distracted from the Pfizer dump. 46,000 people took the vaccine in a trial period...42,000 had adverse affects (sic) and 1200 died,"" reads an Instagram post shared May 5.

He also appeared on Fox News on Oct. 11, discussing the exchange with host Tucker Carlson.\n\nBut Pfizer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and news reports before the vaccine’s approval were clear that while the vaccine was effective in preventing symptomatic and severe disease, there was no data about whether it stopped transmission to others.\n\nSome may have been surprised at Small’s answer, given public officials’ comments about vaccines and transmission. Both Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have said that vaccination can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe CDC in May 2021 changed its guidance on masking, with Fauci saying on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" that vaccinated people’s chances of transmitting the virus to others was low. The agency reversed course on that guidance two months later, when it became clear that wasn’t the case with the delta variant.\n\nBut the notion that Pfizer ""admitted"" it didn’t test its vaccine for its ability to stop transmission is incorrect.\n\nAndrew Widger, a spokesperson for Pfizer, said in a statement that details of its phase 3 clinical trial have been online since 2020, and that the trial was never intended to study transmission.\n\nThe phase 3 clinical trial was ""designed and powered"" to evaluate the COVID-19 vaccine’s efficacy in preventing disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease, Widger said. ""Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,"" he said, which means it wasn’t an outcome being studied.\n\nThe FDA, meanwhile, said in its Dec. 11, 2020, announcement of emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s vaccine that there wasn’t yet ""evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person."" A Pfizer press release that same day and another announcing its approval in the European Union on Dec. 21, 2020, made no mention of the vaccine’s effect on transmission.\n\nDr. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said the outcomes being measured in the original vaccine trials for Pfizer and Moderna were always about their effectiveness against ""symptomatic COVID-19.""\n\n""So, the prevention of transmission (and asymptomatic COVID) were not primary endpoints of these trials and were never a claim of the pharmaceutical companies in developing these vaccines,"" Gandhi said, adding, ""Indeed, this revelation is not new.""\n\nTara Smith, a Kent State University epidemiology professor, agreed, saying the Pfizer executive’s statement was ""not a ‘gotcha.’"" In a December 2020 article for the online website SELF, Smith wrote that the vaccine’s ability to stop transmission was an unanswered question, noting that it’s common in initial vaccine trials for that topic to be addressed in later studies.\n\n""We were hopeful in spring/early summer 2021 that vaccines would be effective against transmission. Delta did change that a bit, making it clear that while vaccines did, and still do, help to reduce one’s risk of infection, they alone are not enough to stop transmission,"" Smith said in an email to PolitiFact. ""That’s why many of us were and remain frustrated at CDC’s messaging around masks, suggesting the vaccinated could stop masking.""\n\nBefore the delta and omicron variants came along, studies suggested that the vaccines were somewhat effective in slowing transmission of the coronavirus.\n\n""In the era before omicron, and to some extent the delta variant, the vaccines clearly were transmission-halting to a high degree,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nOnce variants began evading vaccine immunity and breakthrough infections became more common, he added, vaccines were less likely to stop transmission.\n\nWhen Walensky ""said that vaccines decrease transmission and therefore, getting vaccinated protected others, she was providing accurate information to the American public based on data at the time,"" said Gandhi.\n\nIt’s clear that the vaccines are not a firewall against transmission to others, despite misleading claims on two occasions by President Joe Biden that we fact-checked in 2021.\n\nCurrently, Gandhi said, a recent study during the Omicron surge showed that vaccines or prior infection each decreased transmission to others by about 20%.\n\n""The pharmaceutical companies and the CDC both were accurate in terms of their messaging and reporting on the vaccines over time in terms of their ability to reduce transmission and — currently — their incredible ability to reduce severe disease due to the generation of cellular immunity,"" Gandhi said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn Instagram post claimed that a Pfizer executive suddenly ""admitted"" that its COVID-19 vaccine had not been tested for preventing transmission before it went to market.\n\nBut this is not a revelation. Pfizer’s clinical trial was always intended to study whether the vaccine prevented recipients from getting symptomatic COVID-19 and whether it prevented severe disease.

The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40940-4', 'Headline': 'Effects of public-health measures for zeroing out different ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China. From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-023-00002-0', 'Headline': 'An equitable route forward from China’s ‘zero COVID’ policy - Nature', 'Snippet': ""Over the past 3 years, China’s ‘zero COVID' policy has contained numerous outbreaks and averted an estimated 1.5 million deaths across all socio-economic strata 1.The emergence of highly ..."", 'Full_text': ""Over the past 3 years, China’s ‘zero COVID' policy has contained numerous outbreaks and averted an estimated 1.5 million deaths across all socio-economic strata1. The emergence of highly transmissible Omicron variants of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated that sustaining this policy is unfeasible, with mounting economic costs and growing public dissatisfaction2. In mid-November 2022, the National Health Commission released 20 measures toward gradual relaxation of the ‘zero COVID’ policy3. This was further streamlined to 10 measures in early December as the most substantial move so far toward living with the virus4. This included allowing home isolation for mild symptoms, dropping testing requirements for most venues and domestic travel, implementing targeted rather than large-scale lockdowns, and emphasizing the vaccination and boosting of people over 60 years of age. As China grapples with its largest wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, these measures have largely been welcomed after 3 years of the most stringent control measures of any country.\n\nA pro-equity focus is needed alongside relaxed policies for COVID-19, given the disproportionate impact of the disease on socio-economically disadvantaged communities, which generally have lower vaccination rates5, especially as immunity wanes6. Socio-economic disadvantage lowers a person’s ability to adhere to measures such as mask wearing, social distancing, vaccination and self-isolation7. Factors related to this include inadequate health literacy, which may be positively associated with vaccine hesitancy; overcrowded living and working conditions; limited income to afford personal protective equipment; and limited benefits such as sick leave8.\n\nInvestment is needed to minimize the effects of COVID-19 on at-risk socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Access to high-quality healthcare services such as intensive care unit beds has been lacking, especially in the socio-economically deprived areas of central and Western China9, which could greatly reduce access to timely treatment. People on low incomes are often less aware of their chronic non-communicable disease (NCD) status and have less access to effective treatment for NCDs, which in turn places them at greater risk for COVID-19 sequelae10. Although the new COVID-19 measures have increased resources for treatment, ongoing limitations of health service availability in socio-economically deprived areas pose challenges for adequate treatment use. Furthermore, it is unclear if existing financial subsidies for covering out-of-pocket expenditure for COVID-19 treatment will be sustained, particularly as increasing cases of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 emerge. Ending these subsidies would pose financial risks for those on low incomes or with limited health coverage.\n\nWe believe that the following actions are critical to avoid reinforcing existing health inequities as China develops its new policy approach. First, accelerate universal vaccination, including highly effective booster shots, among the general population, focusing on outreach to older people in socio-economically deprived rural areas, where there is limited access to health services. Vaccination programs should target those working in industries that require frequent close contact with others, informal migrant workers, and those in dense living conditions. Second, promote universal masking in higher-risk settings, and continue access to affordable personal protective equipment and testing. This includes the direct provision or offer of subsidies to low-income households, as well as low-cost or free testing. Third, offer COVID-19 treatments to all, in order to prevent substantial mortality from COVID-19, particularly in at-risk communities. This could include mobilizing trained health personnel to provide treatment, including anti-viral agents and oxygen therapy, for people with severe COVID-19 in areas with limited healthcare services, during the winter months, when cases are likely to be higher. Fourth, collect socio-economic demographic data on routine health records. This would support the monitoring of health inequities, including those related to COVID-19, as well as facilitate targeted health interventions for those at highest risk.\n\nFifth, promote preventative behaviors, together with free primary health screening for NCDs, such as hypertension and diabetes, which are underlying risk factors for COVID-19. These measures are in line with the Healthy China 2030 plan, which emphasizes a life-course approach to NCD prevention and management. This could provide opportunities for promoting COVID-19 vaccination and risk reduction, as well as opportunities to strengthen the quality of care for NCD management. An ongoing commitment to investing in health infrastructure, capacity building and affordable NCD management in the most resource-limited regions of China would support equitable access to high-quality healthcare services, including those for COVID-19.\n\nShifting resources away from intensive ‘zero COVID’ measures and onto targeted public health interventions, with an emphasis on socio-economically disadvantaged communities, would be the most equitable way forward. As the mass migration of people for the Chinese New Year approaches, the time for drastic outreach is now.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add1891', 'Headline': 'Zeroing out on zero-COVID | Science - AAAS', 'Snippet': 'Zero-COVID helped slow the spread and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

With a population of 1.41 billion, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by ...', 'Full_text': 'It is challenging to strike a balance between epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. Each country and city may have its own unique circumstances that require additional considerations and adaptations [1]. China has a population of 1.41 billion. Due to this huge population base, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a scientific, gradual, and cautious approach. Preparations for the epidemic and changes in the external environment have created conditions for the reopening [2], including the evolvement of the external environment, gradual formation of the COVID-19 immune barrier, the increased awareness of virus prevention, the advancement in COVID-19 treatment, lower virulence of the Omicron variant [3], and the decreased severe COVID-19 rate and mortality rate [4].\n\nExpansion of healthcare capacity\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the reopening policy, mainly in the following aspects: First, to prepare for potential risks of medical resource overloading associated with the reopening, in the past 3 years, the National Health Commission of China has taken measures to expand healthcare capacity and make progress in treating COVID-19. Common fever clinics have been opened and critical care beds have been expanded to alleviate medical overloading. Medical institutions across the country have strengthened their respiratory infectious disease prevention and control capabilities, with increased medical beds and equipment, as well as improved medical rescue abilities. Moreover, China’s medical grading diagnosis and treatment system plays an important role in meeting the needs of patients and effectively operating the primary medical system. Antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been included in medical insurance through fast-approval channels, and maximum efforts are being made to provide drugs to patients in need. The government and health departments at all levels are providing human, financial, and material support to primary medical institutions to help establish an effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment mode.\n\nDuring the reopening period, China focused on enhancing the ability to treat severe COVID-19 cases, improving the efficiency of transferring severe cases, and preventing mild cases from becoming severe. The collective efforts of the public governance system helped to meet medical needs and navigate the peak of infections.\n\nVaccination program\n\nSecond, SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China [5]. With the widespread promotion and the national free vaccination policy, by early November 2022, over 90% of the total population had completed the full course of the new coronavirus vaccine. Research conducted by the National Major Scientific and Technological Infrastructure for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center showed that among infected individuals aged 60 or older who received two to three doses of the inactivated coronavirus vaccine, the rate of severe illness protection reached 90.15% [6]. The rate of severe illness protection for all infected individuals was reported to be 96.02%. Data released by a research team from the University of Hong Kong also supported the efficacy of domestically produced inactivated vaccines in preventing severe illness and death [7].\n\nEpidemic prevention and control mechanism\n\nThird, over the past 3 years, China has improved its epidemic prevention and control mechanism for COVID-19. The “State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism” was established as a multidepartment coordination platform to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. Through this mechanism, many local outbreaks have been successfully controlled, and guidelines have been developed by the National Health Commission and experts in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, medical treatment, and public health policy. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infection” has been updated ten times to provide up-to-date strategies and recommendations.\n\nWeakened viral virulence\n\nLast but not the least, the variant of SARS-CoV‑2 is accompanied by variable characteristics of the clinical picture, with disease severity appearing to be lower with the Omicron variant [8]. Some scientists warned that this does not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed less virulence than previous variants of concern and lung function was less compromised [9]. There is growing evidence to suggest that, with the protection of vaccines and improved treatment conditions, the harm of COVID-19 to the population has significantly decreased over time [10].\n\nThese are just some of the prerequisites for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus is highly contagious, and the short-term surge in confirmed cases is an undoubtful challenge faced by medical institutions after the reopening. The 3‑year period of hard and effective epidemic prevention and control in China has won valuable time and experience for the comprehensive opening up of the country. It seems that the threat of the virus to the population has become more manageable; thus, ending the dynamic zero-COVID policy and reopening the country supports economic recovery and international cooperation. In 2022, Omicron became the dominant strain in China, with a weakened pathogenicity resulting in mostly mild symptoms and a small proportion of severe cases. With high vaccination rates and effective epidemic control measures, the focus shifted from “dynamic clearance” to “protecting vulnerable populations.” On January 7, 2023, the State Council issued the 10th edition of the prevention and control plan, which emphasized vaccination and personal protection, optimized testing strategies, and outlined emergency measures during the epidemic.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/', 'Headline': ""What is China's zero-COVID policy and how does it work?"", 'Snippet': 'Nearly three years into the pandemic, China is sticking with a strict COVID-19 containment policy that has caused mounting economic damage and widespread frustration, while keeping its borders ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00191-7', 'Headline': 'China’s zero-COVID strategy: what happens next? - Nature', 'Snippet': 'China’s stringent zero-COVID strategy is likely to face its toughest test yet in the next few weeks, as millions of people travel around the country for Chinese New Year, and the Winter Olympics ...', 'Full_text': 'China’s stringent zero-COVID strategy is likely to face its toughest test yet in the next few weeks, as millions of people travel around the country for Chinese New Year, and the Winter Olympics begin in Beijing.\n\nThe approach — which was introduced by the central government early in the pandemic and has involved large-scale lockdowns, mass testing and international travel bans — has been under pressure since China’s first Omicron cases were reported in mid-December. The highly infectious variant has been detected in at least 14 provinces and cities including Tianjin and Beijing, and scientists fear that fresh outbreaks might occur after next week’s events.\n\n“Omicron is going to create more of a challenge and lead to more disruptions than previous variants,” says Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. Outbreaks might spill into the community and will be difficult to control, he says. “The Olympics is going to be a big test.”\n\nEven though Omicron is tough to contain, its increased transmissibility and ability to evade vaccine-derived immunity have hardened support for China’s unwavering strategy among some scientists.\n\nNear-impossible to keep out\n\nResearchers say that vaccines based on inactivated-virus technology — such as China’s widely used CoronaVac and Sinopharm vaccines — offer some protection against severe disease with Omicron, but will prevent few Omicron infections. “It is not the right time to reopen,” says Chen Tianmu, an epidemiologist at Xiamen University.\n\nBut other researchers argue that it will be near-impossible for China to keep the variant out. “You can’t stop the wind with your hand,” says Rafael Araos, a physician and epidemiologist at the University for Development in Santiago. The costs of shutting borders outweigh the benefits, now that vaccines can reduce hospitalizations and deaths, he says. “It is getting harder and harder to justify the zero-COVID approach.”\n\nIn the past few months, China has experienced its largest COVID-19 outbreak since April 2020. In late November, daily cases of infections peaked at 361 — a marginal figure relative to the size of the country’s population. Nevertheless, in response, China’s government pursued swift and severe measures to get case numbers down.\n\nMillions-strong cities have implemented strict lockdowns and introduced rounds of mass testing. Residents have had to make do with intermittent deliveries of food and medicines. In Xi’an in December, the government even banned all traffic and cancelled flights.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, China’s international borders have effectively been closed, preventing almost anyone from getting in or out. That has kept daily cases in the country in the hundreds or fewer, rather than the hundreds of thousands seen in the past few weeks in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nIneffective inactivated vaccines\n\nThe heavy-handed response continues even though China has administered nearly 3 billion doses of vaccines. Some 85% of the population have been fully vaccinated, and a large fraction have received a third dose.\n\nBut a highly vaccinated population is unlikely to be a barrier against Omicron’s spread. The relative inefficacy of China’s vaccines at preventing infections, combined with Omicron’s increased transmissibility, will make it harder for China to maintain its zero-COVID approach, says Yanzhong Huang, who studies global health in China at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. However, “it’s precisely that lack of confidence in their vaccines” that is causing China to stick to the zero-COVID approach, he adds.\n\nModelling led by Chen suggests that even with 80–90% coverage with its existing vaccines, China could still experience huge numbers of hospitalizations and deaths if it relaxes its zero-tolerance strategy while a variant with similar properties to those of Omicron is spreading.\n\nFears about this kind of outcome have led China to double-down on its pandemic-response efforts, says Huang. The government is strongly urging people not to travel for Chinese New Year celebrations — which normally see huge numbers travelling across the country to visit family — but it has stopped short of a total ban, so there is likely to be movement anyway.\n\nAnd international athletes attending the Olympics will be confined to a ‘bubble’, flying in on chartered flights, travelling from their hotels to sports venues in dedicated vehicles and being subjected to daily testing. Tickets will not be sold for events, and the few spectators who are allowed to attend will be instructed not to shout or cheer. In terms of precautionary measures, it’s probably “the most stringent Olympics in history”, says Huang.\n\nPlanning an exit\n\nResearchers have differing views on when and how China might plan its exit from the zero-COVID strategy.\n\nMany say ramping up booster campaigns is important. “We advise to push forward the boosters to combat the emerging variant,” says Pengfei Wang, a virologist at Fudan University in Shanghai.\n\nBooster-vaccine coverage should be “as high as possible before we reopen the country”, reaching at least 90%, agrees Chen. “We need to build our immunity barrier high.”\n\nCowling argues that China should time the ramp-up of its booster campaign as close to the nation’s reopening as possible, to account for waning immunity. “Vaccines are not so critical for maintaining zero-COVID but are really critical for an exit from zero-COVID,” he says.\n\nFurthermore, different kinds of vaccine — such as those based on messenger RNA, rather than inactivated-virus vaccines — should be considered for third, booster shots, because this might offer better immunity, says Lu Jiahai, an infectious-diseases epidemiologist at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.\n\nAlthough the country’s inactivated-virus vaccines have been the most widely used, China has also approved an adenovirus-vector and a protein-subunit vaccine. Furthermore, it has two mRNA vaccines in early-stage trials, says Lu. Alternatives to inactivated-virus vaccines are more widely available internationally, but China has so far shown a steadfast determination to use only Chinese jabs.\n\nIn December 2020, Shanghai-based pharmaceutical company Fosun Pharma and biotechnology company BioNTech, based in Mainz, Germany, announced that they had collaborated to produce an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and to supply doses to China. However, the vaccine has not yet been approved by regulators. If it is, it would be the first internationally developed vaccine to be approved on the Chinese mainland.\n\nBut Shibo Jiang, a virologist at Fudan University, says it’s likely that none of the world’s available COVID-19 vaccines will offer sufficient protection against emerging variants. Instead, says Jiang, countries need to develop vaccines that can elicit potent neutralizing antibodies against the broader group of related coronaviruses. He adds that people in China are increasingly convinced of the need to invest in such vaccines, especially since the emergence of Omicron.\n\nSome researchers say that outbreaks during the Olympics might start to loosen the authorities’ zero-COVID approach, and contribute to a mental shift among the population towards a greater tolerance of outbreaks.\n\nBut unless COVID-19 comes under control in the rest of the world, “as long as you believe that even a small opening can be devastating for China, you’re not going to expect it to abandon that approach”, says Huang. “There are some tough decisions for the leaders to make.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-60762032', 'Headline': 'Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on?', 'Snippet': 'The first signs of strain on the much-vaunted zero-Covid model in China began to appear when authorities were forced to impose increasingly large lockdowns triggered by the more infectious Delta ...', 'Full_text': 'For the last two years, China\'s strict measures to contain Covid, enforced by swift lockdowns and aggressive restrictions, seemed to be largely paying off.\n\nAs the rest of the world grappled with surges in cases and deaths in 2020, China\'s President Xi Jinping declared the country\'s handling of the pandemic through lockdowns and widespread testing a success - and touted its methods as being the most effective in dealing with the virus.\n\nThe zero-Covid model was therefore strictly enforced both in mainland China and Hong Kong.\n\nBut things soon began to change.\n\nThe first signs of strain on the much-vaunted zero-Covid model in China began to appear when authorities were forced to impose increasingly large lockdowns triggered by the more infectious Delta variant in 2021. These started to raise questions about how long China could maintain this policy.\n\nAnd now Omicron has called it further into question.\n\nIn mainland China, thousands of cases are now being reported each day and millions of people in the north-eastern province of Jilin have been placed under lockdown - the first time China had restricted an entire province since the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan.\n\nHong Kong, which was previously almost untouched by the virus, is now seeing 30,000 cases and more than 200 deaths a day. The city\'s healthcare system has been overrun, with shocking images of people in need of hospital care receiving rudimentary treatment outside medical facilities.\n\nIt\'s a situation unlike anything the country has seen for the past two years.\n\nOfficially, the Chinese government has not budged from its zero-Covid position. But there have been some signs that it may be softening its stance on how best to deal with the virus.\n\nEarlier this week, China\'s National Health Commission said it was changing its rules so that mild cases would be isolated in centralised locations, rather than treated in hospitals. The criteria for a patient to be discharged from quarantine has also been lowered.\n\n""In the past, China would actually admit every patient - whether they were asymptomatic or with just mild symptoms - to the hospital,"" Prof Jin Dong-yan of The University of Hong Kong told the BBC.\n\n""The fact they\'re now proposing to [locally isolate] them - that\'s one step to show they recognise that there\'s a large group of people that do not need much help.""\n\nDuring China\'s recent National People\'s Congress meeting, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also said China would continue to make its Covid-19 response more ""scientific and targeted"".\n\n""[Premier Li\'s speech] hints that the government is ready to be more flexible and loosen restrictions gradually,"" said Prof Chen Gang of the National University of Singapore.\n\n""Under [a more] dynamic policy, more emphasis will be placed on striking a balance between disease control and enabling people to live normal lives.""\n\nOn the ground as well, there\'s also been a noticeable shift in attitudes.\n\nLast year, top Chinese epidemiologist Zhang Wenhong suggested that China would eventually need to ""co-exist"" with the virus. He was met with a barrage of criticism, with some calling him a traitor, and others saying he was colluding with foreign forces to undermine China\'s Covid response.\n\nBut just this week, Dr Zhang posted another message on Chinese social media that got a very different reception.\n\nWhile he said that it was necessary for China to maintain its zero-Covid strategy for now, he added that it should not be afraid to eventually move towards a more ""sustainable coping strategy"" in the future.\n\n""With this virus, alleviating fear is the first step we must take,"" he said.

Unfortunately, these celebrations coincided with — and are sure to exacerbate — a Covid-19 outbreak currently spreading throughout the country.\n\nThis spike comes on the heels of China’s National Health Commission ending many of its “zero-Covid” policies in December. These public health regulations had heavily restricted travel within and to the country, quarantined infected individuals in government-run facilities, and enforced city-wide lockdowns that required millions to stay indoors for months at a time. While the US threw the term “lockdown” around in the early stages of the pandemic, China was one of the few countries that actually did lock down its population.\n\nThese initiatives did prevent repeated surges in Covid-19 cases. But it also led to inadequate responses to other health crises and emergencies — including a November 2022 building fire in the Xinjiang region where virus-related blockades prevented an effective emergency response. Protests over the last few months of 2022 bubbled across major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Urumqi, calling for an end to lockdowns, censorship, and in some cases, even Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s presidency.\n\nBeijing’s decision to end zero-Covid policies may have saved the nation from further social chaos. But how it eased up resulted in a public health crisis, with an estimated 2.02 million government-confirmed Covid-19 cases (though that’s likely an undercount) as of January 29, compared to 119,836 cumulative cases a year ago.\n\nAlthough a variety of zero-Covid strategies have been tried in different countries since the start of the pandemic, they have varied in intensity, length, goals, and outcomes. In some nations, lockdowns were used intermittently to control outbreaks and to give public health leaders time to develop and distribute vaccinations. China’s lockdowns were used as a primary prevention measure. Partially, China’s current outbreak stems from the country’s all-or-nothing mentality, experts told Vox. The country eased lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mass testing, all at once — and the virus came rushing in.\n\nLockdowns aren’t a popular public health strategy when strung out for long periods of time. But that doesn’t mean they can’t be a useful option in the pandemic playbook. Lockdowns cannot contain a disease like Covid-19 indefinitely — especially more contagious variants — but they can mitigate the spread and give public health leaders time to prepare for other aspects of their pandemic response, such as vaccinations. The public health lessons learned from the end of China’s zero-Covid era might be some of the most important in preparing for future pandemics and learning how to live with diseases.\n\n“At the beginning [of a pandemic], if there’s no treatment, no vaccine, and we have very limited knowledge about this new phenomena, a lockdown is more acceptable,” said Jennifer Bouey, chair of the global health department at Georgetown University. “Once there are vaccines, once there’s treatment, once we understand the nature of the pathogen, then they should be switched to a combination of different things.”\n\nLockdowns worked during SARS. China hoped they would work again.\n\nIn January 2020, only two days before the Lunar New Year, China banned travel to and from the 11 million-person city of Wuhan because of the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus, soon known as Covid-19. In March, as the threat of the virus grew, other countries closed their borders, with the World Health Organization declaring Covid-19 a pandemic.\n\nMany countries, including China, adopted true lockdowns as a means to stamp out the Covid-19 virus. These measures quarantined infected and exposed individuals, and locked down entire buildings, cities, and regions.\n\nChina had reason to believe this strategy would work again, given that during the outbreak of SARS — now called the SARS-CoV-1 virus — in the early 2000s, the nation used a citywide lockdown of Beijing in 2003 to contain the disease. “People didn’t go out for six weeks, school was canceled, the streets were empty, and the epidemic ended,” said Elanah Uretsky, chair of international and global studies at Brandeis University, of China’s SARS response. “It ended because of those lockdowns and massive quarantine policies. And we learned to believe in them.”\n\nIn the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, little was known about how the virus spread, so public health guidance changed constantly. The application and length of lockdowns varied by country. In France, there were clear guidelines that allowed residents to travel outdoors for activities such as walking a pet. In contrast, in Wuhan, only one member of a household was permitted outside every two days to buy necessary resources. New Zealand, an island country with a zero-Covid approach, prevented Covid cases and deaths early in the pandemic by closing its borders.\n\nHowever, Covid-19 proved to be more “elusive” than SARS, said Uretsky. Covid can present asymptomatically — unlike SARS — and therefore it can evade some contact tracing protocols. While it isn’t as deadly as SARS, Covid is more transmissible, meaning that one person infects multiple people at a higher rate.\n\nMeanwhile, it was difficult for countries with large populations and land masses, such as the US and China, to have the type of nationally coordinated response seen in smaller island nations like Singapore and New Zealand. Given its size and politics, the US was unable to nationally coordinate the country’s Covid response and instead relied on individual regions or states to dictate public health measures.\n\nInstead of zero-Covid, the US opted for a strategy of “flattening the curve,” which entailed decelerating the rate of Covid-19 infection to ease the burden on hospitals. “I think China’s massive error, considering that their population is enormous, was not doing what many countries did, or strived to do, which was ‘flatten the curve,’” said Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist with the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.\n\nIn mid-2021, even nations that had maintained low case numbers and death rates through lockdowns adjusted their policies, and instead focused on vaccination campaigns and ramping up contact tracing efforts. Wealthy nations with access to vaccines began immunizing their populations in December 2020, and by the end of August 2021, over 2 billion people were fully vaccinated. Over the last year and a half, many former zero-Covid countries prioritized administering booster vaccines and slowly phased out contact tracing protocols.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, the nation’s zero-Covid policies dragged on for two years. The nation was able to keep cases low, relative to its population, until March 2022. At that time, the omicron variant of the virus swept through the country, leading to a lockdown in the 25 million-person city of Shanghai for two months. This extended lockdown sparked anger among residents and would add fuel to the growing anti-government sentiments that manifested via protests later that year.\n\nWhy China’s post-zero-Covid era is going so poorly\n\nAfter over 150 partial and full city-wide lockdowns and months-long protests, China released new Covid-19 guidelines in early November and early December that softened or reversed earlier zero-Covid practices. In November, the guidelines cut down isolation time, removed mass testing sites, and increased resources to health care facilities. In December, health codes (proving lack of Covid exposure or a negative test result) to enter most public spaces were no longer required and infected individuals with mild or no symptoms could quarantine at home rather than at government-run facilities.\n\nHowever, China lifted these policies not because it was prepared to do so, but because of political pressure from the nationwide protests, said Ha-Linh Quach, a research assistant at Duke NUS medical school in Singapore. Quach — who also previously worked with Vietnam’s National Committee of Covid-19 — said Vietnam followed China’s lead when attempting to manage the spread of the virus, but also found that mass quarantines were publicly unpopular. Instead, in 2021 the country began prioritizing social distancing, mask-wearing policies, and vaccine distribution.\n\nUnlike other countries — like Taiwan, South Korea, or Singapore — that used periods of strict lockdowns to prepare for their inevitable reopening, and the internal travel that it would spawn, China did no such thing, said Uretsky.\n\nRather than reopening in stages, China lifted many of its most useful measures all at once — despite the fact that prior to easing these regulations, Covid cases were already on the rise. “Unfortunately for China, lack of preparation for the inevitable breach of an increasingly infectious pathogen results in exactly what we’re seeing,” said Miller.\n\nFor example, alongside these eased regulations, China announced it would ramp up its vaccination of the elderly, something the experts Vox spoke to say should have happened much earlier. When the restrictions were lifted, only 40 percent of Chinese residents above the age of 80 had received a Covid-19 booster shot, according to China’s National Health Commission.\n\nOther countries that exited periods of intense lockdowns, such as Vietnam, not only used vaccines to prepare, but also bolstered their social distancing policies and contact tracing programs as they transitioned, said Quach.\n\nAs part of its zero-Covid policies, China used a digital health code system that assigned users QR codes based on their exposure and testing status, and that were needed to enter public spaces. Now, these codes are no longer required to access many public areas or to travel in China.\n\nYet Singapore, when the nation lifted many of its zero-Covid policies in June 2021, continued to use its version of these health codes for almost a year. These codes helped Singapore track down those who were exposed to someone with Covid-19 at an expedited rate. “It is not a breakthrough technology,” Quach said. “But it’s amazing to me how it is being used for public health.”\n\nThat said, these codes, while effective in the small nation of Singapore, had limited success in China due to the country’s size and lack of data-sharing. “On paper, it can work, but it’s very difficult to implement in the real world, especially in such a large country,” said Bouey. “It turns out that every province is doing their own work, and they’re not integrated. So when people travel from one province to another, the code suddenly doesn’t work.”\n\nLack of data and rampant misinformation have also exacerbated China’s post-lockdown problems. The current outbreak is thought to have begun in November 2022, and although the official number of total Covid-19 deaths in China, as of January 30, is now over 110,000 — which would still be low relative to the nation’s 1.4 billion population — the true figures are thought to be much higher. One model from December predicted that as many as 1 million people could die from Covid in China over the first few months of the year, but without transparent information from Beijing, these forecasts remain speculative.\n\n“In the absence of data, there is misinformation,” Miller said. “I think the seeds of the spread of Covid were already happening in China. But the information as to the extent of it and the location of it would have allowed people to make informed decisions. In the absence of that, people are making whatever decision they want to make.”\n\nWhat this teaches us for the next pandemic\n\nAssuming another unknown virus will spread across the globe again in our lifetimes, the Covid-19 pandemic has given public health leaders fresh insight into what policies can be most effective in mitigating the spread of diseases. And lockdowns, when used appropriately and swiftly, remain a useful tool in our arsenal for early pandemic days.\n\nCovid-19 was actually the “ideal candidate” for lockdowns, said Miller. This is because of the virus’s highly transmissible, airborne, and often asymptomatic nature. “Candidates for lockdown include pathogens that are novel to human populations, and therefore there is no innate immunity to them,” Miller said. “Highly infectious pathogens for which there are (currently) no vaccines or treatments are also candidates for lockdown.” In theory, the only type of diseases that lockdowns cannot mitigate are those that are not transmitted via human-to-human contact, such as water or foodborne illnesses, said Bouey.\n\nLockdowns give leaders time to develop vaccination distribution campaigns, set up contact tracing programs, and learn more about the pandemic-causing disease, Miller added.\n\nThis is why it’s important to distinguish between “short-term lockdowns with underlying goals” and “long-term lockdowns that hope to beat the odds and keep Covid out indefinitely,” said Miller. Brief lockdowns that helped “flatten the curve” were effective and helped keep hospitalizations and deaths down. But extended lockdowns, like the ones seen in China, failed to contain the virus and damaged the country’s economy and well-being.\n\n“As we have seen, these lockdowns are very disruptive, in terms of economic livelihood, as well as social life and even mental health,” said Bouey. “There is profound damage to the society and to the economy.”'}}",96.875,1

The last time that happened in metro Chicago was February 2020, a month before the city announced its first COVID-19 death.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in metro Chicago — which includes a total of 14 counties in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — remained below 4% again in both June and July.\n\nWhile it might be premature to declare an end to the regional economic emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of pre-pandemic unemployment levels for three consecutive months is, perhaps, a sign that the worst is behind us.\n\nWBEZ analyzed more than 20 years of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Current Population Survey to get a closer look at the region’s elevated unemployment rates during the pandemic. We wanted to see how they compared with rates during earlier times of economic upheaval. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSharper spike and speedier recovery\n\nIn April 2020, metro Chicago’s unemployment rate jumped nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month to 18.72%. That’s the highest jump and the highest rate in a single month since at least 1990, the earliest date for which regional unemployment data was available on the bureau’s website.\n\nBy January 2021, the unemployment rate had dipped below 7%. By November 2021, it fell below 5%, and it dropped below 4% this May. While unemployment took more than three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, it was a shorter recovery period compared to the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe economic downturn resulting from the housing market crash is considered to have lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During that window, the rise and fall of unemployment in metro Chicago was not nearly as dramatic as during the pandemic, and the higher rates dragged on for much longer. The region’s unemployment began its slow and steady ascent in August 2006, when it was 4.45%. That rate increased each month, reaching a peak of 11.49% in January 2010 — almost 3 1⁄2 years later. The rate slowly decreased over the next few years, but it didn’t dip below 5% until January 2017.\n\nUnequal patterns among racial groups\n\nNo racial or ethnic group of workers, no age group and no gender in metro Chicago was immune to the sting of the pandemic.\n\nBut for some groups, unemployment spiked higher or lasted longer, according to a WBEZ analysis of raw data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll of the U.S. labor force sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOnce the rates came down, they settled into the same unequal patterns that existed before the pandemic, the analysis shows.\n\nThe estimated unemployment for Latinos in metro Chicago skyrocketed at the onset of the pandemic — growing in April 2020 from under 6% to more than 23%. It would top 20% again in both May and June of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Black nor white workers saw rates top 20%. For white workers, unemployment also jumped dramatically from less than 4% to nearly 16% in April 2020. In that month, Black unemployment rose from under 9% to nearly 17%, a smaller increase than for the other groups. Black unemployment didn’t reach its peak of nearly 19% until August 2020, according to the WBEZ analysis.\n\nHowever, overall unemployment estimates for white and Latino workers settled back to pre-pandemic rates much faster than they did for Black workers. White unemployment fell below 4% for three straight months by October 2021. Latino unemployment dipped below 6% for three consecutive months by November 2021. Unemployment for Black workers in metro Chicago didn’t drop below 9% for three consecutive months until July 2023.\n\nIn addition, for much of the past two decades, Black unemployment estimates in the region have typically remained at least twice as high as those for white unemployment. Since 2000, the average monthly unemployment estimate for Black workers in metro Chicago has been about 12.63%, which is comparable to the 13.19% average monthly unemployment estimate for white workers during the four months when it was at its peak — from April to July of 2020.\n\nSince 2000, those were the only four months when white unemployment estimates topped 10% in metro Chicago. However, for Black workers, unemployment estimates have topped that mark in 209 months since 2000.\n\nEssential workers meant lower pandemic unemployment\n\nThe surge in Latino unemployment may have been influenced by the large share of Latino workers in the restaurant and food services industry, one that was hit hard during the earliest months of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, restaurant and food services was the leading industry for Latino workers in metro Chicago. But by April 2020, unemployment for restaurant and food service workers was nearly 45%. It didn’t fall back to single digits until September 2021.\n\nIn recent months, however, the industry appears to have rebounded. Restaurant-related unemployment has been below 4% in six of the eight months between December 2022 and July 2023. And the region’s estimated number of workers in that industry topped 340,000 in July 2023, the highest such figure since June 2019.\n\nAs it might be expected in a public health crisis, unemployment for hospital workers has been much lower and far more stable. It was just 4% in April 2020. It climbed to 10% in May 2020 before falling below 7% in June 2020.\n\nThe leading industry for Black workers in 2020 was hospitals, the WBEZ analysis shows. That might have helped keep Black unemployment from growing as dramatically as it did for other groups during the first few months of the pandemic.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.chicagotribune.com/2021/12/28/unemployment-down-consumer-prices-up-experts-paint-a-picture-of-the-2022-economy/', 'Headline': 'Unemployment down, consumer prices up: Experts paint a picture of the ...', 'Snippet': 'Chicago’s unemployment rate, which includes data from Naperville and Arlington Heights, stood at 6.2% in November, according to labor department data.

At the time, unemployment in the city was at 5.1%.\n\nStill, a review of jobless rates in the top four metropolitan areas shows Chicago faring better than New York and Los Angeles but consistently worse than Houston.\n\nLightfoot made the claim several times throughout 2021, but we could find only one — at a news conference in April — where she specified it pertained to the top four most populated areas in the country, rather than all big cities.\n\n“We have the lowest unemployment rate among the top four largest U.S. cities,” she said. “None of that happened by chance.”\n\nIn all her other statements we could find on the issue — including the New Year’s Eve press release — Lightfoot opted for more broad language suggesting Chicago is doing better than all large cities.\n\n“The numbers that I look at … tell me that Chicago’s got the lowest unemployment rate of any big city in the country,” Lightfoot said during a May 20 news conference.\n\nAt another event, on July 22, she used similar language.\n\n“With a historic post-pandemic recovery on the horizon — and folks, we are coming back,” Lightfoot said during a ribbon cutting for Elm 551 at Parkside. “Every indicator says that’s so both in terms of our numbers of tourism, our hotel occupancy, the fact that events are coming back to this city, our unemployment rate is the lowest of any major city in the country. Lots of great things are happening.”\n\nGiven that broader language and the mayor’s repeated use of the phrase “any” major city, including in the press release, we reviewed federal Bureau of Labor Statistic’s figures beyond the top four metropolitan areas. With the exception of New York and Los Angeles, Chicago’s jobless rate was worse than any of the other top 15 metro areas.\n\nBetween January and November 2021, Chicago had an average unemployment rate of 7%, which was higher than 12 of the 15 metropolitan areas. The metro area with the lowest average unemployment rate over the 11-month period was Atlanta at 3.6%. Los Angeles had an average rate of 9%, making it the metropolitan area with the highest average unemployment rate.\n\nHouston, with 2.3 million residents, is closest in population to Chicago, which has 2.7 million residents, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. Based on the federal data, Houston had lower unemployment rates compared to Chicago for six of the 11 months from January through November.\n\nEven though Lightfoot’s office relied on the bureau’s jobless rates for the metropolitan areas, which include suburbs, we also checked jobless rates only within the city limits.\n\nA comparison of the 10 of the nation’s largest cities shows that half of them — San Jose, Calif., Phoenix, Dallas, San Antonio and Houston — had lower jobless rates than Chicago, based on 11 months of data available through the bureau.\n\nWhen considering only areas within city limits, Houston’s unemployment rate was better than Chicago’s in every available month, January through November.\n\nOur ruling\n\nLightfoot said, “Chicago maintained the lowest unemployment rate through most of 2021 of any large American city.”\n\nBy any statistical measure, the statement is not accurate. Chicago’s unemployment rate in 2021 was consistently worse than other comparable cities, with the exception of only New York and Los Angeles.

The CES survey is a Federal-State cooperative endeavor between State employment security agencies and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDefinitions. Employment data refer to persons on establishment payrolls who receive pay for any part of the pay period which includes the 12th of the month. Persons are counted at their place of work rather than at their place of residence; those appearing on more than one payroll are counted on each payroll. Industries are classified on the basis of their principal activity in accordance with the 2017 version of the North American Industry Classification System.\n\nMethod of estimation. CES State and Area employment data are produced using several estimation procedures. Where possible these data are produced using a ""weighted link relative"" estimation technique in which a ratio of current-month weighted employment to that of the previous-month weighted employment is computed from a sample of establishments reporting for both months. The estimates of employment for the current month are then obtained by multiplying these ratios by the previous month\'s employment estimates. The weighted link relative technique is utilized for data series where the sample size meets certain statistical criteria. For some employment series, the estimates are produced with a model that uses direct sample estimates (described above) combined with other regressors to decrease volatility in estimation.\n\nAnnual revisions. Employment estimates are adjusted annually to a complete count of jobs, called benchmarks, derived principally from tax reports which are submitted by employers who are covered under state unemployment insurance (UI) laws. The benchmark information is used to adjust the monthly estimates between the new benchmark and the preceding one and also to establish the level of employment for the new benchmark month. Thus, the benchmarking process establishes the level of employment, and the sample is used to measure the month-to-month changes in the level for the subsequent months. Information on recent benchmark revisions is available online at https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/benchmark.htm.\n\nReliability of the estimates. The estimates presented in this release are based on sample surveys, administrative data, and modeling and, thus, are subject to sampling and other types of errors. Sampling error is a measure of sampling variability—that is, variation that occurs by chance because a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed. Survey data also are subject to nonsampling errors, such as those which can be introduced into the data collection and processing operations. Estimates not directly derived from sample surveys are subject to additional errors resulting from the specific estimation processes used. The sums of individual items may not always equal totals shown in the same tables due to rounding.\n\nEmployment estimates. Changes in metropolitan area nonfarm payroll employment are cited in the analysis of this release only if they have been determined to be statistically significant at the 90-percent confidence level. Measures of sampling error for the total nonfarm employment series are available for metropolitan areas and metropolitan divisions at www.bls.gov/web/laus/790stderr.htm.\n\nArea definitions. The substate area data published in this news release reflect the delineations issued by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget on April 10, 2018. The 12 metropolitan areas discussed in this release are the metropolitan areas with the largest population according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area includes Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, and Will Counties in Illinois; Jasper, Lake, Newton, and Porter Counties in Indiana; and Kenosha County in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Chicago-Naperville-Arlington Heights, IL Metropolitan Division includes Cook, DuPage, Grundy, Kendall, McHenry, and Will Counties in Illinois.\n\nThe Elgin, IL Metropolitan Division includes DeKalb and Kane Counties.\n\nThe Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI Metropolitan Division includes Lake County in Illinois and Kenosha County in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Gary, IN Metropolitan Division includes Jasper, Lake, Newton, and Porter Counties in Indiana.\n\nAdditional information\n\nEmployment data from the CES program are available on the BLS website at www.bls.gov/sae/.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.

He said workers have different attitudes these days, especially after the pandemic.\n\n“‘I’m not interested in overtime.’ Overtime is important,” Evans said in a conversation with Chamber President and CEO Todd Maisch. “‘I’m not interested in working the weekend shift.’ Well the weekend shift is important, especially when demand is so high, goods demand is high, production is at capacity, and so those are the shortages.”\n\nTo ease the economic pressure, Evans said they plan restrictive policies.

Well, you can sort of make that choice yourself, right?”\n\nFed Fund Rates this week are 3.25. A month ago, they were 2.5. A year ago, they were 0.25 percent. Evans compared that to nearly thirty years ago.\n\n“The fed in 12 months increased the interest rate by 300 basis points and it was referred to as the biggest bloodbath in the bond market of all time. That was in 1994, ‘95,” Evans said. “We have just done 300 basis points in seven months.”\n\nAs more interest rate hikes come, Evans sees a hiring slowdown ahead.\n\n“We’re tightening monetary policy,” Evans said. “I suspect that the unemployment rate is going to begin to creep up as the effect of higher interest rates work their way into the mortgage market and other credit activities.”\n\nEvans said the fundamentals of the economy are strong and believes growth will go from negative or stagnant to slow expansion later this year.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.chicagobusiness.com/employment/chicago-area-unemployment-nears-record-low', 'Headline': 'Unemployment nearing record low around metro Chicago', 'Snippet': 'The Chicago metropolitan area is approaching a record-low unemployment level, according to federal survey data released by the Illinois Department of Employment Security. ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.chicagolandchamber.org/chamber-news/chicagoland-chamber-announces-all-in-initiative-advocating-for-economic-and-regulatory-relief/', 'Headline': ""Chicagoland Chamber Announces 'All In' Initiative Advocating for ..."", 'Snippet': 'The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce is pleased to launch a coalition of over fifty Chamber partners throughout the state in announcing its 2022 agenda for the Chambers All In for Economic Recovery.

In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected].\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot', 'Headline': 'Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot', 'Snippet': 'Babbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.

Police officers testified to the violence and mayhem. Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.\n\nYet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public’s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained attack on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.\n\nBy excusing former President Donald Trump of responsibility, minimizing the mob’s violence and casting the rioters as martyrs, falsehoods about the insurrection aim to deflect blame for Jan. 6 while sustaining Trump’s unfounded claims about the free and fair election in 2020 that he lost.\n\nSpread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes.\n\nSeveral different conspiracy theories have emerged in the year since the insurrection, according to an analysis of online content by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs on behalf of The Associated Press. Unfounded claims that the rioters were members of antifa went viral first, only to be overtaken by a baseless claim blaming FBI operatives. Other theories say the rioters were peaceful and were framed for crimes that never happened.\n\nConspiracy theories have long lurked in the background of American history, said Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University professor who studies political misinformation. But they can become dangerous when they lead people to distrust democracy or to excuse or embrace violence.\n\n“If we’re no longer operating from the same foundation of facts, then it’s going to be a lot harder to have conversations as a country,” Carnahan said. “It will fuel more divisions in our country, and I think that ultimately is the legacy of the misinformation we’re seeing right now.”\n\nAn examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T TRUMP SUPPORTERS\n\nIn fact, many of those who came to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said — proudly, publicly, repeatedly — that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nDifferent versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa.\n\n“Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,” Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.”\n\nThe next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim.\n\nAnother Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven’t been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants.\n\nYet Carlson claimed on his show that “in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.”\n\nCarlson is a “main driver” of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal’s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.\n\n“Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,” Gaetz said.\n\nSpokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.\n\nIn truth, the rioters are just who they said they were.\n\nOne was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.\n\n“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans said on the video. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” Vice President Mike Pence was in the building to preside over the Senate’s certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. Pence went ahead despite Trump’s pleas to get Pence to block the transfer of power.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by “fake Trump protesters.”\n\n“We have not seen evidence of that,” said Wray, who was appointed by Trump.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T VIOLENT\n\nDozens of police officers were severely injured. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and died a day later of natural causes.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who rushed to the scene, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” The assault stopped only when he said he had children. He later learned he had suffered a heart attack. Fanone resigned from the department in December 2021.\n\nRioters broke into the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled under armed protection. They rifled through desks and looked for lawmakers, yelling, “Where are they?” In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.\n\nThat’s not how some Republican politicians have described the insurrection.\n\nAppearing on Ingraham’s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.\n\n“By and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has since said that he doesn’t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a “normal tourist visit.” Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.\n\nTrump called the insurrection a display of “ spirit and faith and love.”\n\nRioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose.\n\n“The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,” Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. “And, you know, I won’t be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.”\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS\n\nTrump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nImmediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been “cheated” and “defrauded” in the “rigged” election by a “criminal enterprise” that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol.\n\nAt one point, Trump did urge his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.” The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric.\n\n“We fight. We fight like hell,” he told those who would later break into the Capitol. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nNow, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.\n\n“I wasn’t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,” Trump said on Fox News in December.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN OFFICER WORKING FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nBabbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed. An investigation cleared the officer of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Capitol Police Department protects all members of Congress, as well as employees, the public and Capitol facilities. The officer wasn’t assigned to any particular lawmaker.\n\nTrump falsely claimed the officer was the head of security “for a certain high official, a Democrat,” and was being shielded from accountability. He also misstated where Babbitt was shot.\n\n“Who is the person that shot … an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?” Trump asked on Fox News.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE JAN. 6 SUSPECTS ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ARE BEING MISTREATED\n\nNo, they are not, despite some assertions from members of Congress.\n\n“J6 defendants are political prisoners of war,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted in November. She said she had visited some suspects in jail who complained about the food, medical care and “re-education” they were receiving in custody.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said the Justice Department was “harassing peaceful patriots” by investigating their involvement in the insurrection.\n\nWhile it’s true some of the suspects have complained about their time in jail, it’s wrong to argue they’re being held as political prisoners. Authorities have said the suspects in custody are being given the same access to food and medical care as any other inmate.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist - The New York ...', 'Snippet': 'On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door.', 'Full_text': 'A mountain of evidence shows that the rioters were supporters of Mr. Trump, but that has not stopped the cascade of specious claims seeking to pin responsibility on others.\n\nA false theory blaming agitators affiliated with antifa, a loose collection of antifascist activists, began to spread on social media before the riot had even ended. Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-breach/police-chief-turned-yoga-instructor-insists-ashli-babbitt-is-not-dead-before-jan-6-judge-locks-him-up-for-more-than-a-decade/', 'Headline': ""Alan Hostetter insists Ashli Babbitt didn't die on Jan. 6 - Law & Crime"", 'Snippet': 'A former police chief in La Habra, California, who went on to become a yoga instructor and a convicted felon for his actions on Jan. 6 was sentenced Thursday to more than 11 years in prison, but not before he claimed Ashli Babbitt isn’t actually dead — even as Babbitt’s mom looked on in court.', 'Full_text': 'A former police chief in La Habra, California, who went on to become a yoga instructor and a convicted felon for his actions on Jan. 6 was sentenced Thursday to more than 11 years in prison, but not before he claimed Ashli Babbitt isn’t actually dead — even as Babbitt’s mom looked on in court.\n\nAlan Hostetter, unlike his Three Percenter “DC Brigade” co-defendants found guilty by a jury in November, was convicted of four charges after a July bench trial before Senior U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nA litany of false and conspiratorial claims\n\nThe creator of the video is a self-described former Obama voter and special education teacher who now posts live-streams and other content under the persona ""the Salty Cracker.""\n\nHis website has a disclaimer at the bottom of his website that reads, ""These are the opinions and ramblings of a lunatic. They are for entertainment purposes only and are probably wrong.""\n\nMany of his claims in the nearly 10-minute video were, as promised, wrong:\n\nHe called the attack a ""false flag hoax."" It wasn’t. It was an effort to flip an election that left several people dead, more than 140 officers injured, and $1.5 million in property damage.\n\nHe insisted that a man named Ray Epps instigated the siege as one of several ""FBI assets."" That’s not true. There is no evidence that the FBI orchestrated the attack, and Epps, a former Oath Keeper seen near the Capitol on videos, told the House committee investigating the attack that he has no ties to the FBI or law enforcement.\n\nHe said that the rioters who supported Trump were sentenced to 40 years in prison for ""staying in between the velvet lines."" That’s false. Claims that Jan. 6 was a ""normal tourist visit"" are Pants on Fire, and the longest sentence handed down to date was for 63 months.\n\nNo documented antifa presence\n\nThroughout his video, the Salty Cracker claimed that Babbitt was trying to stop antifa activists in disguise ""who were breaking into the f------ Speaker’s Lobby over here, and then got shot.""\n\nHere’s how he described what happened before her death:\n\n""All of the Trump supporters (were) trying to stop these people from breaking windows, trying to stop these people from setting the place on fire. Donald Trump supporters trying to extinguish the false flag, and apparently Ashli Babbitt was one of these individuals, and we got it on tape … As she’s trying to stop them, then they start chasing her. So then she’s got to climb through. She can’t go backwards, so she’s got to go forward.""\n\nBut several rioters denied the antifa rumors themselves in social media posts and messages. PolitiFact rated the claim that antifa provoked Babbitt’s shooting Pants on Fire, one of the many falsehoods about the Jan. 6 attack that merited PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year designation.\n\nRELATED VIDEO\n\n""We have no cases of antifa in our database of individuals charged with breaking into the Capitol,"" said Roderick Cowan, the executive director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, which maintains a database on the more than 700 people facing charges. ""Nor have we ever seen evidence of a named individual who supports antifa there.""\n\nAmong the rioters nearby when Babbitt died were Zachary Alam, the rioter wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat who smashed the windows to the Speaker’s Lobby that Babbitt later climbed through; Chad Barrett Jones, who helped bust the glass with a rolled-up Trump flag; and Thomas Baranyi, who wore a Trump-Pence hat and left the Capitol with Babbitt’s blood smeared on his hand.\n\nA speculative video analysis\n\nBut what about the pro-Trump mob? Was Babbitt trying to fend those rioters off?\n\nThroughout his video, the Salty Cracker read from an article in the Epoch Times, a pro-Trump outlet, with the headline: ""Babbitt tried to stop attack on Capitol Speaker’s Lobby, video shows.""\n\nThe article largely ignored the actions that prompted Babbitt’s fatal shooting, when she tried to push through the window to the Speaker’s Lobby. In an interview after the riot, Baranyi said the police were warning her to stop, but that ""she didn’t heed the call.""\n\nThe article instead focused on the buildup to that moment, claiming that the footage captured by those who were there, when slowed down, showed Babbitt trying ""to prevent the attack, not join it."" Some of that footage came from John Sullivan, an activist controversial on both sides of the political spectrum, whose presence fueled the antifa falsehood, and who faces several charges.\n\nThe Epoch Times’ evidence for its assertion: that Babbitt had ""looks of shock and concern"" on her face; that she was ""so distressed at the violence, she jumped up and down in frustration""; that she ""confronted"" Alam before he punched the window she later climbed through; that she winced at his punch; that and she at one point shouted, ""Stop! No! Don’t! Wait!""\n\nThose claims are speculative and unsubstantiated. Videos of the incident do not clearly capture all that Babbitt was saying and doing, let alone feeling, at the time.\n\nWhether Babbitt was feeling shocked and concerned, and whether she was jumping because she was frustrated, is also a matter of interpretation.\n\nOther footage from Tayler Hansen, a self-described ""independent journalist"" whose Twitter account includes statements of support for conservative causes, shows Babbitt leaning toward Alam and appearing to say something. But it’s not clear that she was confronting him.\n\nExperts in multimedia forensics told PolitiFact it’s nearly impossible to discern from Sullivan’s video what Babbitt was saying. She’s far away from Sullivan’s microphone in a loud room with many people shouting, making it difficult to attribute speech directly to her.\n\n""This is a classic ‘cocktail party effect’ recording of an unknown number of speakers, overlapped, speaking loud,"" said Catalin Grigoras, director of the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado, Denver. Grigoras and other experts said the science available to experts would likely be unable to isolate Babbitt’s voice from Sullivan’s video.\n\nOne rioter recalled for investigators that Babbitt said something along the lines of, ""Just open the door. They’re not gonna stop."" And another video recorded by Hansen showed Babbitt shouting at the officers. (It’s not clear what Babbitt is saying in that clip, either, experts said.)\n\nTrump supporters try to break through a police barrier on Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington. (AP)\n\nThe Epoch Times article also quoted from Hansen and Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt.\n\nHansen told the Epoch Times that Babbitt was ""literally trapped"" in a corner. Aaron Babbitt said she climbed through the window because she feared for her life and wanted to escape.\n\nBut Hansen’s video shows that Babbitt was the first to reach the doors leading to the Speaker’s Lobby. Footage shows her not pinned but moving freely prior to the incident..\n\nOur ruling\n\nA YouTube video claimed, ""Ashli Babbitt tried to stop antifa false flag on Jan. 6.""\n\nThe video was posted by a creator whose website includes a disclaimer saying his opinions are meant ""for entertainment purposes only and are probably wrong.""\n\nIn this case, the video’s central claim that Babbitt was fighting to thwart an antifa false flag is a ridiculous rewriting of what happened inside the Capitol. Babbitt was shot as she attempted to climb through the shattered window of a door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby.\n\nThere was no documented trace of antifa involvement at the Capitol or in her shooting, and the suggestion that Babbitt was trying to stop the mob’s advances was based largely on speculation about what she was doing, saying and feeling in the moments leading up to her death.\n\nWe rate this YouTube video Pants on Fire!'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/jan-6-capitol-riot-suspects-viral-one-year-later-100001248.html', 'Headline': ""They went viral on Jan. 6.

See how in this 3D explainer from Yahoo Immersive.\n\nThose were just some of the images that went viral on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building as Congress was certifying the 2020 election results.\n\nFive people died in connection to the attack, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by police as she tried to break into the House chamber, and a Capitol Police officer who died from a stroke one day after being pepper-sprayed during the riot. More than 140 other police officers were injured defending the Capitol, four of whom have since taken their own lives.\n\nAccording to the FBI, more than 725 people have been criminally charged — including those who went viral — and more are expected to be arrested.\n\nHere is what the people in those viral images were charged with, and where the cases against them stand, nearly a year since the deadly insurrection.\n\nThe QAnon Shaman (Jacob Chansley)\n\nOf the countless images that emerged from inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, few have been more indelible than those featuring Jacob Chansley — the shirtless, spear-toting man seen storming the halls of Congress in a horned, fur headdress, his face painted red, white and blue.\n\nChansley, better known as the QAnon Shaman, was among the first group of rioters to enter the Capitol while the election certification was under way. According to prosecutors, once inside the building, Chansley used a bullhorn “to rile up the crowd and demand that lawmakers be brought out,” before making his way into the Senate chamber. He was photographed sitting in Vice President Mike Pence’s chair on the Senate dais, where, prosecutors said, he left a note that read: “It’s Only A Matter of Time. Justice Is Coming!”\n\nPhotos of 34-year-old Chansley were among the first to circulate on social media as rioters ransacked the Capitol; some Trump allies soon tried to use them as proof that antifa leftists were responsible for the violence, rather than the president’s own supporters. But such claims were easily debunked, in part because Chansley’s distinct tattoos and unmistakable getup were quickly recognized from various right-wing political rallies in Arizona over the previous year where Chansley, a prominent promoter of the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory group, had been a regular fixture. It was later reported that he had served in the U.S. Navy from 2005 to 2007.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, Chansley called the FBI’s Washington field office on Jan. 7 and confirmed that he was, in fact, the man in the face paint and horns seen during the Capitol attack. He said he’d traveled from Arizona at the request of Trump, who urged all “patriots” to go to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 to protest the certification of the Electoral College results. Two days later, he was taken into custody and charged with obstruction, civil disorder, demonstrating in a Capitol building, and violent entry and disorderly conduct in a Capitol building.\n\nChansley has remained behind bars throughout his court proceedings, but that hasn’t kept him out of the spotlight. He made headlines by demanding to be served organic meals in jail and then sat for an interview with “60 Minutes” in March in which he said his actions on Jan. 6 were not an attack but an attempt “to bring God back into the Senate.” His attorney, Al Watkins, also gave a number of high-profile interviews in the days after Chansley\'s arrest, insisting that his client’s behavior during the riot was “peaceful” and that Trump was to blame for his presence at the Capitol, calling on the outgoing president to pardon Chansley and other supporters who’d since been arrested. When no pardon came, Watkins said Chansley would be willing to testify against the former president during his second impeachment trial.\n\n[Poll: Share of Trump voters who believe Biden \'won fair and square\' falls to 9%]\n\nChansley’s attitude appears to have evolved significantly over the last several months, much of which he spent in solitary confinement. In September, he agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of obstructing an official proceeding. At his sentencing hearing at the federal district court in Washington in November, he apologized for his role in the Capitol attack in a lengthy speech that featured quotes from Jesus and Gandhi and references to the popular 1994 film “The Shawshank Redemption,” a prison drama.\n\nThough Judge Royce Lamberth praised Chansley’s comments, telling him, ""I think you are genuine in your remorse and heartfelt,"" he denied Watkins’s request to sentence Chansley to time served.\n\n“What you did is terrible,” Lamberth told Chansley before sentencing him to 41 months, or roughly three and a half years, in prison. At the time, Chansley’s sentence was tied for the harshest handed down so far in connection with the Jan. 6 riot (that title is now held by the 63-month prison term given to Robert Palmer — more on him below).\n\nAfter all, Lamberth said, Chansley ""made himself the image of the riot.”\n\nDespite telling the judge he wanted to take accountability for his actions, Chansley has since hired new lawyers and filed a notice of appeal, seeking to overturn his conviction and prison sentence. It was not immediately clear on what grounds the appeal will be based, but Chansley’s options are limited under the conditions of his plea agreement. His new lawyers — one of whom briefly represented Kyle Rittenhouse — have suggested they may pursue a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Watkins, Chansley’s former attorney.\n\nChansley’s new attorney, John Pierce, declined a request for comment from Yahoo News.\n\nIn an email to Yahoo News, Watkins confirmed that he is no longer representing Chansley, writing, “as such, I am not in a position to comment on his case.”\n\n“Mr. Chansley is a very gentle, intelligent and kind man,” Watkins’s email continued. “I sincerely wish him all the best in his life.”\n\nThe suspect with the fire extinguisher (Robert Palmer)\n\nIn the days and weeks after Jan. 6, video footage continued to emerge from the Capitol that, along with firsthand accounts from police officers who were at the scene, painted a clearer picture of the brutality encountered by law enforcement that day. It soon became evident that one of the most violent clashes between police and members of the pro-Trump mob took place near the Lower West Terrace entrance to the Capitol, where rioters were seen dragging two officers into the crowd and beating them with an array of objects, including metal pipes, barricades, fire extinguishers and flagpoles, in what one Capitol Police officer later described as “something out of a medieval battle.”\n\nAmong those involved in the hours-long melee on the Lower West Terrace was 54-year-old Robert Palmer of Largo, Fla. According to prosecutors, Palmer made his way to the Capitol on Jan. 6 after attending Trump’s rally near the White House earlier that afternoon. Visible in an American flag jacket and a red “Florida for Trump” hat, Palmer can be seen in a variety of photos and videos of the mob, which prosecutors used to trace his movements at the Capitol.\n\nAccording to court records, Palmer was initially spotted around 4 p.m. leaning over a railing on the Capitol’s Upper West Terrace, where he held a sign that read “Biden is a pedophile” and cheered on the mob attacking police on the terrace below. Palmer observed the fighting from above for about 50 minutes before making his way down to the Lower West Terrace, where, prosecutors said, he threw a wooden plank at officers, hitting a riot shield. He then proceeded to move further into the heart of the battle, joining the front line of rioters attacking police who were attempting to block access to a tunnel leading from the terrace into the building. Video footage captured Palmer spraying a fire extinguisher at the officers at close range and then hurling the empty canister at them twice, along with an orange traffic barrier.\n\nAfter the crowd had been cleared from the terrace, Palmer and others continued to confront police on the plaza below, where at approximately 5:15 p.m. he obtained a 4- to 5-foot pole. After ignoring warnings from Virginia State Police officers to drop the pole, prosecutors said, Palmer began screaming obscenities and “threw the pole like a spear at the officers,” prompting a state trooper to fire a rubber bullet, hitting Palmer in the stomach. After a few minutes on the ground, video footage documents Palmer walking around showing off a bruise.\n\n“Attempting to portray himself as the victim rather than the aggressor, Palmer pointed at his abdomen, shouting, ‘This is the United States. This is what our country is doing to its citizens,’” prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memo. Although no specific police injury was tied to Palmer’s conduct at the Capitol, prosecutors said that based on the size and weight of the plank and fire extinguisher, and the speed and force with which Palmer threw them, the objects were capable of inflicting serious bodily injury.\n\nDespite all the footage of Palmer’s actions on Jan. 6, he was not arrested for his role in the riot until March 17, after he was identified by an online sleuth and named publicly in an article by HuffPost. In the piece, Palmer claimed he “didn’t do anything wrong” at the Capitol. On Oct. 4, however, he pleaded guilty to assaulting, resisting or impeding officers with a dangerous weapon, and last month he was sentenced to 63 months, or more than five years, in federal prison — the longest sentence to date resulting from the criminal investigation of the Jan. 6 attack. He was the first Capitol defendant to be sentenced on the charge of assaulting officers using a dangerous or deadly weapon.\n\n[Jan. 6 Capitol riot: One year later, key numbers to know]\n\nPalmer attempted to express remorse for his actions ahead of his sentencing, which, under his original plea agreement, called for a prison term ranging from 46 to 57 months.\n\n“I realize that we, meaning Trump supporters, were lied to by those that at the time who had great power, meaning the sitting president as well as those acting on his behalf,” Palmer wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan last month.\n\nAt his sentencing hearing he told the judge that while he was in jail, he watched footage of himself on Jan. 6 on an MSNBC news segment and was “horrified, absolutely devastated to see myself on there.”\n\n“I’m really, really ashamed of what I did,” Palmer said.\n\nWhile federal prosecutors acknowledged in their sentencing memo that Palmer should get credit for turning himself in and cooperating with the FBI, they also argued that his statements “both on January 6 and up to the present,” even after his guilty plea, “suggest a distinct lack of remorse for his conduct, a tenuous relationship with truth, and a willingness to repeat falsehoods for personal benefit.”\n\nIn particular, prosecutors pointed to an online fundraiser for Palmer’s legal defense that had been created at his direction, after he’d pleaded guilty and been taken to jail in D.C., in which he claimed he did “go on the defense and throw a fire extinguisher at the police” only after being shot with tear gas and rubber bullets. Prosecutors argued that this statement, which Palmer later admitted in court was a lie, reflected a failure to accept responsibility for his actions, and Chutkan agreed, increasing the range of his sentence to 63 to 78 months.\n\n“I don’t know if your remorse now is genuine or not,” Chuktan said before handing down the sentence. “It sounds like it is. Your actions after your plea undercut that argument.”\n\n“The men and women who kept democracy functioning that day, and saved lives, they deserve the thanks of the nation,” the judge told Palmer. “They didn’t deserve to have fire extinguishers thrown at them; they didn’t deserve to be spat on. Perhaps, having seen yourself on videotape and media coverage, you understand how terrified the rest of this country must have been.”\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo News, Palmer’s attorney, Bjorn Brunvand, said there’s “no doubt” his client’s online fundraising request “had detrimental effect on his ultimate sentence.” But, Brunvand continued, “I think he’s remorseful regardless of what was said during that attempt at fundraising,” adding that Palmer “immediately refunded the money and removed the post.”\n\n“I think he did that at a moment when he was feeling really down and desperate,” he said.\n\nBrunvand also told Yahoo News that while Palmer received a “strong sentence,” it “certainly could’ve been a lot worse,” noting that his client had been facing up to 20 years in prison for Jan. 6-related charges.\n\nPalmer, he said, is still being held at the D.C. jail while awaiting a transfer to a federal Bureau of Prisons facility, where he’ll begin serving his sentence.\n\nThe man who put his feet up in Pelosi’s office (Richard Barnett)\n\nAs hundreds of Trump supporters swarmed the Capitol on Jan. 6, Richard Barnett, 61, of Gravette, Ark., was photographed inside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s office, smiling with his feet up on a desk, an American flag draped across a nearby credenza, a stun gun visible in his pants. Unsurprisingly, the images were widely shared.\n\nBarnett emerged from the Capitol with a personalized envelope he took from Pelosi’s office, insisting to a New York Times reporter that he didn\'t steal it.\n\n“I left a quarter on her desk,” Barnett said, ""even though she ain’t f***ing worth it.”\n\nHe also left a note for her, using an expletive to refer to the speaker.\n\nTwo days later, Barnett was taken into custody near his northwest Arkansas home and charged with numerous offenses, including disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, theft of government property, entering and remaining in a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon.\n\nUnder federal sentencing guidelines, Barnett faces up to seven years in prison if convicted.\n\nDuring a March hearing, Barnett screamed at the judge for detaining him. He was released in April and ordered to wear an ankle monitor, turn over his passport and not leave his home. He is currently awaiting trial.\n\nHis attorney, Joseph McBride, did not return a request for comment.\n\nIn June, Barnett began selling signed copies of the photo of him inside Pelosi’s office for $100 to help pay his legal fees.\n\n“Richard Barnett\'s picture at Speaker Pelosi’s desk has become the face of the new anti-federalist movement,” a note on a fundraising website reads. “We will not go gently into that good night.”\n\nLast month, Barnett gave an interview to a local television station, saying he felt his actions on Jan. 6 were justified.\n\n“I think more than anything I just wanted to feel like I was closer to the seat of power,” he said.\n\n“When you’re talking about the type of charges many of us got filed against us and the extremes they’ve gone to, it’s out of the ordinary,” he continued. “It’s not normal.”\n\n“At that time I was shocked,” Barnett said of his jail stint. “I mean, now, a lot of time has passed, and in retrospect you go, ‘Wow, is this what our country is really all about?’”\n\n“As far as apologies or regret, no comment,” he added. “You can pretty much guess how I feel, but I can’t comment on it.”\n\nThe man who stole Pelosi\'s lectern (Adam Johnson)\n\nAnother Capitol rioter who achieved viral fame was Adam Johnson, a 36-year-old from Florida who was seen in a knit Trump hat smiling and waving to photographers as he dragged Pelosi\'s lectern through the Capitol Rotunda. (The lectern was reported missing but found the next day in a hallway on the Senate side of the Capitol.)\n\nJohnson subsequently posted to Facebook a different photo of himself taken inside the Capitol that day, and a caller to the FBI’s National Threat Operations Center tip line said they recognized him in the viral image because they shared a mutual friend.\n\nOn Jan. 8, Johnson was arrested near his home in Parrish, Fla., and charged with three counts: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and theft of government property.\n\nJohnson initially pleaded not guilty. Shortly after his arrest, his attorneys, David Bigney and Dan Eckhart, insisted their client simply got swept up in the moment.\n\n“He is a family man,” Eckhart told CNN. “His wife is a physician. He has five children. There is nothing in his background or his past that would attribute any type of violence or this type of rebellious behavior to him. It is an anomaly, an unusual situation for him.”\n\n""He wasn\'t involved in any coup,"" Bigney added. “Things got out of hand. You saw the pictures. He was not there for any destruction, any treason. He was just there to witness history.”\n\nBut late last month, Johnson agreed to plead guilty to one count — entering or remaining in a restricted building — which carries a maximum of up to one year in prison and a fine of $100,000. Johnson, though, is expected to receive less than six months in prison, and as part of his plea, he will pay $500 to the architect of the Capitol.\n\nHe is due to be sentenced on Feb. 25.\n\nThe man in the ""Camp Auschwitz"" hoodie (Robert Keith Packer)\n\nIn another widely circulated photo taken during the riot, several Trump supporters are depicted in a corridor holding a shard of a broken sign with Pelosi’s name on it. To their right is a man wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words “Camp Auschwitz,” a reference to the network of extermination camps run by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Underneath those words is an image of a human skull and the phrase “Work brings freedom.” (That is the approximate English translation of a sign on Auschwitz\'s gate reading ""Arbeit macht frei."")\n\nThe man, identified as Robert Keith Packer, 57, of Virginia, was arrested near his home on Jan. 13. According to a criminal complaint, a store owner in Newport News, Va., recognized Packer as a customer and contacted law enforcement. Surveillance cameras at the store captured Packer about a month before the siege wearing the same “Camp Auschwitz” sweatshirt, and authorities used that information to help identify and locate him.\n\nPacker was charged with two counts: entering and remaining in a restricted building, and violent entry and disorderly conduct and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building. He pleaded not guilty and was released on a personal recognizance bond on the condition that he stay away from Washington, D.C.\n\nPelosi has rarely singled out any of the Capitol rioters when discussing the events of Jan. 6. But she admitted that she couldn’t help but be overcome with anger when she saw Packer in his “Camp Auschwitz” sweatshirt.\n\n“To see this punk with that shirt on,” Pelosi said during her weekly press conference on Capitol Hill a week after the insurrection, “and his anti-Semitism that he has bragged about, to be a part of this white supremacist raid on this Capitol requires us to have an after-action review to assign responsibility to those who were part of organizing it and incentivizing it.”\n\nIn August, Packer was offered a plea deal by the Justice Department, part of an effort to resolve lower-level cases stemming from the attack. Federal prosecutors didn\'t provide details about the offer during a brief hearing that month, but other rioters who have been charged with nonviolent offenses have been offered similar plea deals — many ending with jail sentences of six months or less.\n\nBut Packer has yet to accept the offer.\n\nThe Confederate flag suspect (Kevin Seefried)\n\nKevin Seefried, 51, came to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 with his 23-year-old son Hunter to hear Trump speak. He brought with him a Confederate battle flag that he normally displays outside his home in Wilmington, Del.\n\nSeefried and his son were among those who participated in the march from the “Stop the Steal” rally at the Ellipse to the Capitol, which was “led by an individual with a bullhorn,” according to court documents.\n\nVideo footage showed the two men entering the Senate building through a window that Hunter helped break at 2:13 p.m. ET, according to the FBI.\n\nA short time later, Kevin Seefried was photographed carrying a Confederate battle flag through the halls of the Capitol, past a portrait of Charles Sumner, an abolitionist senator from Massachusetts during the Civil War.\n\nIt was a visceral image that drew immediate anger, particularly among historians who found the juxtaposition jarring.\n\n“The Confederate flag made it deeper into Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, than it did during the Civil War,” William Blair, professor emeritus of history at Penn State, later told the New York Times.\n\nOnce inside, Kevin and Hunter Seefried were part of a large group that “verbally confronted” several Capitol Police officers, court documents say. Hunter was also seen in video footage taking a selfie.\n\nAccording to the documents, Kevin Seefried was identified after a co-worker of Hunter Seefried\'s told the FBI that he had bragged about being inside the Capitol with his father that day.\n\nThe father and son were both arrested in Delaware on Jan. 14 and charged with five counts, including obstruction of an official proceeding, knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\n\nHunter Seefried was indicted on three additional counts: knowingly engaging in an act of physical violence against property, destruction of government property, and violence within the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThey each pleaded not guilty to all counts, and a June 15 trial date has been set.\n\nThe ‘zip-tie guy’ (Eric Gavelek Munchel)\n\nAmong the more chilling images to surface from inside the Capitol on Jan. 6 is a photograph of a man in black tactical gear climbing over seats in the Senate chamber with a fist full of white flex cuffs, or zip ties. His face was almost entirely covered by a black, balaclava-style ski mask under a black baseball cap, but it seemed clear almost immediately that the man in this photo, who would soon be dubbed “zip-tie guy” on social media, was not a law enforcement officer responding to the breach of the Capitol but a member of the mob. Before the “zip-tie guy” had even been identified, some counterterrorism experts speculated that the flex cuffs seen in the photograph might be indicative of a plot by rioters to hold politicians hostage.\n\nAfter the riot, social media sleuths helped the FBI identify the man as 30-year-old Eric Gavelek Munchel of Nashville. Eleven days after the breach of the Capitol, federal prosecutors in Washington filed a criminal complaint with an arrest warrant for Munchel as well as his mother, Atlanta-area nurse Lisa Marie Eisenhart, who, they said, was seen alongside Munchel in several photos and videos taken inside the Capitol complex on Jan. 6.\n\nMunchel and Eisenhart were both initially indicted on charges of entering a restricted building or grounds, obstructing an official proceeding, and violent entry or disorderly conduct for their alleged activities during the insurrection. But in June, prosecutors filed a superseding indictment, charging the pair with eight total counts, including carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon inside the U.S. Capitol. The weapon in question was a Taser, which prosecutors have said Munchel was carrying in a holster on his camouflage pants. Both Munchel and Eisenhart have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nOther evidence cited by the Justice Department includes interviews that Munchel and Eisenhart gave to the Times of London in the immediate aftermath of the attack, as well as footage obtained from Munchel’s cellphone, which he wore mounted on his vest during the riot. Among the key moments prosecutors say were captured in that Jan. 6 recording is the one in which Munchel found the plastic handcuffs, or zip ties, that made him go viral.\n\n“At one point, Munchel spots plastic handcuffs on a table inside a hallway in the Capitol,” attorneys with the DOJ wrote in a pretrial detention memo in January. “Munchel exclaims, ‘Zipties. I need to get me some of them [expletive],’ and grabs several white plastic handcuffs from on top of a cabinet.”\n\nProsecutors said Munchel’s cellphone footage also captured a conversation between the mother-son duo in which they decided to stash unspecified “weapons” in a backpack outside the Capitol before entering the building.\n\nMunchel and Eisenhart were jailed for two months without bond after their initial arrests, but in March, Judge Royce Lamberth — the same D.C. District Court judge who oversaw Jacob Chansley’s case — ordered both of them to be released on bond and placed on house arrest with GPS monitoring.\n\nMunchel was originally placed under the supervision of a friend who allowed him to sleep on the couch of her Nashville apartment before kicking him out, prompting prosecutors to accuse him of violating his bond conditions. In a court filing, Justice Department lawyers asked the judge to place Munchel in the custody of his older brother and to prohibit him from consuming alcohol, arguing that his behavior contributed to his prior eviction.\n\n[The unanswered questions about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot]\n\nAs with other Jan. 6 defendants, Munchel’s lawyer has blamed Trump for her client\'s participation in the insurrection at the Capitol. In a February court filing arguing that Munchel should be released from jail ahead of his trial, attorney Sandra Roland cited the former president’s efforts to discredit the outcome of the 2020 presidential election as motivation for Munchel’s actions on Jan. 6.\n\n“Beginning in 2020, parts of the United States government — first and foremost the President of the United States of America — told the public that the only way President Donald Trump could lose the presidential election was if the election was rigged,” Roland wrote. “After President Trump lost the election, he and other government officials aligned with him said the presidency had been stolen from him by widespread election fraud.”\n\nShe went on to write that that it wasn’t until Jan. 4 that Munchel “agreed to accompany his mother, Lisa Eisenhart, to President Trump’s ‘Save America’ rally to be held on January 6, 2021,” noting that Munchel is not affiliated with “any militant groups or hate groups or anti-government groups, or any groups who planned to do anything on January 6th beyond attending a rally to protest what they perceived as ‘the steal.’”\n\nRoland declined Yahoo News’ request for comment. An attorney representing Eisenhart did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA trial date has not yet been set for either Munchel or Eisenhart.\n\nThe woman carrying ‘The children cry out for justice’ sign (Christine Priola)\n\nShe was hard to miss on Jan. 6: the woman in a red winter parka and MAGA-emblazoned pants with a sign reading “The children cry out for justice,” standing on the floor of the Senate chamber pointing her cellphone where Vice President Mike Pence had been standing minutes before.\n\nTwitter users quickly identified the woman as Christine Priola, a 49-year-old school occupational therapist from Cleveland. The FBI in Cleveland received an anonymous tip that she was employed by the Cleveland Metropolitan School District.\n\nPriola submitted her letter of resignation the day after she learned she was under investigation. In the letter, she cited three reasons for resignation, including beliefs that are in line with the QAnon conspiracy theories espoused by some Trump supporters who took part in the riot:\n\n1. I will not be taking the corona virus 19 vaccine in order to return to in person learning.\n\n2. I will be switching paths to expose the global evil of human trafficking and pedophilia, including in our government and children’s services agencies.\n\n3. I do not agree with my union dues which help fund people and groups that support the killing of unborn children.\n\n(Her third reason, it’s worth noting, highlighted the underreported link between the Capitol riot and anti-abortion extremism prevalent among supporters of QAnon.)\n\nThe school board accepted her resignation shortly after she submitted it, stating that while the board supported the right of any individual to peacefully protest, it condemned the actions taken by hundreds on Jan. 6.\n\n“The right of peaceful protest, as protected by the First Amendment, is a foundation of our democracy,” a spokeswoman for the school board said in a statement. “The forcible takeover and willful destruction of our government is not.”\n\nA day later, FBI agents executed a search warrant at Priola’s Willoughby, Ohio, home, where they recovered a laptop, two desktop computers, several thumb drives and an iPhone, which was apparently wiped clean of data during the riot. However, agents were able to uncover location data from 4:23 p.m. that day, which according to Google Maps corresponded to a location just northeast of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nPriola was arrested on Jan. 14 and charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and unlawful activities on Capitol grounds, parades, assemblages and display of flags.\n\nShe was released on a $20,000 bond, subject to home detention and electronic home monitoring. (She arrived back at her home wearing a long-sleeved white T-shirt with the slogan “Save our children” written on it.)\n\nPriola’s case has been granted numerous continuations, with the government citing the enormous volume of discovery in her case and in other Jan. 6 cases. Her next court date is scheduled for Feb. 1.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/ocean-beach-man-who-took-selfies-in-pelosis-office-during-capitol-riot-pleads-guilty/2886708/', 'Headline': 'Capitol Riot: San Diego Man Who Took Photos in Pelosi’s Office Pleads ...', 'Snippet': 'A San Diego County man pleaded guilty Thursday to a federal misdemeanor for taking part in the breach of the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021.

During that interview, he said that he was inside the Capitol along with scores of Donald Trump supporters who swarmed the building in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the results of Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAccording to prosecutors:\n\n“BARANYI began by showing the reporter blood on his hand, as shown in the screenshot below. When asked how he got blood on his hand, BARANYI explained that ‘[w]e had stormed into the chambers inside and there was a young lady who rushed through the windows. A number of police and Secret Service were saying get down, get out of the way. She didn’t heed the call and as we kind of raced up to try to grab people and pull them back, they shot her in the neck, and she fell back on me.’\n\nWhen asked how he got out of the building, BARANYI stated that ‘riot police came in and started ushering us out with their sticks and stuff.’\n\nBARANYI explained he entered the building on the side ‘with the scaffolding.’\n\n[. . .]\n\nBARANYI further explained that “we tore through the scaffolding, through flash bangs and tear gas, and blitzed our way in through all the chambers just trying to get into Congress or whoever we could get in to and tell them that we need some kind of investigation into this.’\n\n[. . .]\n\nBARANYI later stated, ‘It was a joke to them until we got inside and then guns came out, but we’re at a point now, it can’t be allowed to stand. We have to do something. People have to do something.” BARANYI then held up his bloody hand again and stated, ‘because this could be you or your kids.'”\n\nAt the plea agreement hearing Thursday, Baranyi admitted that he traveled from New Jersey to Washington on Jan. 6.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg asked Baranyi if in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6 he had sent various texts about the election and Jan. 6, including one that said that politicians “have to be removed by force, that’s the only way,” and that it was necessary to “bludgeon through them.”\n\nBaranyi said that he did.\n\nBaranyi also confirmed to Boasberg, a Barack Obama appointee, that he had agreed to talk to law enforcement officers as part of his plea deal.\n\nIn addition to the entering and remaining in a restricted building charge, Baranyi has been charged with disorderly and disruptive conduct and parading, demonstrating, and picketing in a Capitol building. Those charges will presumably be dropped at his sentencing, which Boasberg set for May 6.\n\n[Image via WUSA9]""}}",99.16666666666667,1

In a brief unsigned order without any noted dissents, the justices turned down an emergency filing from Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and Warren Petersen, the president of the Arizona Senate.\n\nThe laws at the center of the dispute were enacted in 2022. They require would-be voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship or face penalties, such as a ban on voting in most elections or an outright bar on voting by mail. The Biden administration and other plaintiffs, including the Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party, went to federal court to challenge the laws, arguing that they violated (among other things) the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection and federal voting laws.\n\nToma and Petersen joined the case to defend the laws after the state’s attorney general, Democrat Kris Mayes, declined to do so in full. The challengers then sought discovery from them, including to depose them about the legislature’s intent in passing the laws. Toma and Petersen argued that an order requiring them to appear for a deposition would violate the legislative privilege – that is, the idea that legislators are shielded from both criminal and civil liability, as well as being compelled to answer questions or produce documents, regarding anything that is an integral part of the legislative process.\n\nThe district rejected that argument, ruling that Toma and Petersen had waived their privilege when they opted to join the case, and both the district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that the depositions could go forward.\n\nToma and Petersen came to the Supreme Court on Nov. 20, asking the justices to put the depositions and discovery on hold to give them time to file a petition for a writ of mandamus – an order directing the lower court to reverse its order on the legislative privilege question. They told the justices that the district court’s “unprecedented ruling will chill both the atmosphere for all legislators to freely express their views during the legislative process and the ability and willingness of present and future legislative leaders to participate in litigation to defend the constitutionality of state laws.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party urged the justices to turn down the request. They emphasized that the discovery requests do not seek information about the legislators’ personal motives, but instead about the legislature’s intent, which “is a proper subject for discovery because plaintiffs’ claims in this litigation include that the challenged laws violate the Equal Protection Clause; one element of such a claim is discriminatory intent or purpose by the legislature.”\n\nAnd Toma and Petersen have other options besides a writ of mandamus, the Democrats argued. For example, they could decline to “comply with the discovery order and then appeal any resulting sanctions or contempt order.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2023/06/post-misrepresents-legal-power-of-arizona-resolution-on-electronic-voting-machines/', 'Headline': 'Post Misrepresents Legal Power of Arizona Resolution on Electronic ...', 'Snippet': ""The Republican majority leader of the Arizona Senate informed county election officials that a Senate resolution essentially bars electronic voting systems in the state.

The state’s Democratic secretary of state and attorney general say the resolution carries no legal weight. Nonetheless, based on the resolution, a Facebook post misleadingly claimed the state “has banned electronic voting machines.”\n\nFull Story\n\nFalse claims about election fraud in Arizona have been circulating since the 2020 election. Former President Donald Trump has made a series of false claims about fraudulent ballots and “massive … voting irregularities” in the state’s 2020 election, as we’ve written before. Those claims followed investigations and audits that confirmed Joe Biden won the state’s presidential election.\n\nDisputes over the integrity of Arizona’s election process continue, despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud. On May 22, a judge rejected Republican Kari Lake’s suit claiming misconduct in the 2022 gubernatorial election, which she lost to Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\nThat same day, Arizona’s Republican Senate Majority Leader Sonny Borrelli questioned the security of the state’s voting machines in a letter sent to all 15 county boards of supervisors. Borelli told the officials that a concurrent resolution passed by the legislature earlier this year essentially bans electronic voting machines. Borelli claimed the legislature has “plenary authority” to override federal law and the governor.\n\nConservative commentator Tim Pool picked up on Borelli’s claim in a video posted on Facebook, quoting from the letter and falsely claiming that Arizona “has banned electronic voting machines in the 2024 election.”\n\nBut a resolution is defined in the Arizona Legislative Manual as “a declaration or expression of legislative opinion, will, intent or ‘resolve’ in matters within the Legislature’s legal purview.” It is not a law and has no legal power.\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political science at Arizona State University, told us that the definition of resolution “doesn’t matter” to Borrelli, who is relying on the theory that the U.S. Constitution gives states absolute power over how elections are run.\n\nThat theory, which Borrelli referenced in his letter to election officials, is known as the independent legislature theory. It’s a reading of the Constitution advocated by some conservative lawyers that says state legislatures have the absolute power to regulate elections, with a legislature’s authority exceeding that of the governor, the courts and the electorate, Lindquist said in a phone interview with FactCheck.org.\n\n“What [Borrelli] is arguing is that by passing the concurrent resolution, the legislature has spoken, and under this particular theory, that’s all that’s needed,” Lindquist said.\n\nThe theory hinges on the Constitution’s elections clause, which says the “times, places, and manner” of holding elections for senators and representatives “shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.” Borrelli’s letter said the clause “specifically conveys electronic voting systems (manner) are not mandated in statute to be used as a primary method for counting, tabulating, or verification.”\n\n“The letter is relying on a theory that has never been tested, and many constitutional scholars are skeptical of its validity,” Lindquist said.\n\nState officials have dismissed Borrelli’s letter.\n\nIn a statement issued on May 22, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said the resolution “does not have the force of law.”\n\nFontes, May 22: Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037, which expresses a desire to restrict the use of certain electronic voting machines, is non-binding and does not have the force of law. Election equipment must be certified by the federal and state government by specific requirements outlined in federal and state law. That certification process is being followed in Arizona and all applicable election equipment being used in Arizona is certified. If those requirements or certification process were to be changed, it would require a regular bill to be passed by the legislature and signed by the governor — which is not the case for this non-binding resolution. We defer to the Attorney General’s office on all other legal questions.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, also a Democrat, agreed with that view. The resolution “is non-binding and has no legal impact,” a Mayes spokesman told the Arizona Mirror.\n\nArizona House and Senate Republicans passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037 in March, with voting along party lines. The resolution states that no electronic voting system can be used unless it meets certain criteria, including that it is made in the U.S. and has a publicly available source code.\n\nThe resolution contains language similar to Senate Bill 1074, which the state House and Senate passed and Hobbs vetoed on April 6.\n\n“The election equipment required by this bill, as well as the problem it purports to solve, does not exist,” the governor said at the time.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

It would mandate, for instance, that election workers hand-count ballots instead of using electronic equipment to tabulate results.\n\nThe bill would “create a system where losers can set aside the will of the people,” said Alex Gulotta, who runs the Arizona chapter of the voting rights group All Voting is Local. “This is an all-out assault on the freedom to vote.”\n\nThe bill’s lead sponsor, GOP Rep. John Fillmore, told CNN in a telephone interview that he’s trying to “ensure the integrity of the voting process.”\n\nUnder his proposal, lawmakers would meet to either “accept or reject election results” following primary and general elections. If legislators reject the results, any qualified voter “may file an action in the Superior Court to request that a new election be held,” according to the bill.\n\nFillmore said lawmakers should possess authority as “representatives of the people” to review the vote count. But, he said, “if there’s a problem, we’re not overturning anything. We’re just trying to put the skids on it and say, ‘This has to be adjudicated.’ “\n\nCurrently, in Arizona, the secretary of state certifies the statewide election results, which also are signed by the governor, state attorney general and chief justice of the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe bill also would eliminate the state’s widely used early voting-by-mail program and prohibit officials from requiring voters to wear masks at polling places.\n\nFifteen other lawmakers have cosponsored Fillmore’s bill, including state Rep. Mark Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state. Former President Donald Trump has endorsed his bid to become Arizona’s election chief.\n\nFinchem did not respond to a CNN inquiry.\n\n“The fact that (Arizona lawmakers) are willing to put their names on these democracy-ending bills is a sign of where we’re going to go if we don’t, as a country, start speaking out against this stuff,” Gulotta said.\n\nArizona – a state President Joe Biden flipped by fewer than 11,000 votes – has been at the forefront of brazen attempts by Trump loyalists to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate last year commissioned an error-plagued hand count of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix.\n\nThe review, undertaken by a Florida firm called Cyber Ninjas, affirmed Biden’s win, but election officials widely discredited the company’s methods and most of its conclusions. The firm recently shut down.\n\nThe state will hold one of the marquee US Senate contests this year as Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly seeks reelection to a full term. Kelly, one of the chamber’s most vulnerable incumbents, won a special election in 2020 to fill the seat once held by late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican.\n\nIt’s not clear that Fillmore’s measure will gain traction in the legislature.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers, but by narrow margins. As a result, a handful of GOP defectors can sink legislation pushed by others in their party. Last year, a GOP proposal that would have allowed the state legislature to revoke presidential electors chosen through the popular vote and appoint its own slate failed.\n\nFillmore’s proposal – along with his recent remarks suggesting the state return to what he described as 1950s voting practices – sparked rebukes.\n\n“We need to get back to 1958-style of voting,” Fillmore said during a House committee meeting Wednesday – as he argued that voters should cast paper ballots, in person, on Election Day.\n\nOfficials with the Democratic Leadership Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to state legislatures, denounced the comments.\n\n“Republicans have started saying the quiet part out loud: their restrictive voting laws have nothing to do with promoting safe and accessible elections — they just want to drag us back to before the Civil Rights Movement,” Gabrielle Chew, the group’s vice president of communications, said in a statement.\n\nIn the interview with CNN, Fillmore said that by calling it a “1958 bill” he was describing the procedures he prefers, not an era. “In person, no electronics, on paper, count the ballots that day,” he added, ticking off his preferred voting rules.\n\nSo far this year, Arizona Republicans have introduced dozens of bills they say are needed to restore voter trust in elections.\n\nOne, approved by a House committee this week, would ban the use of unmonitored ballot drop boxes. Another bill would create a new “bureau of elections” in the governor’s office with a $5 million budget and subpoena powers to “investigate allegations of fraud in any state county or local government election.” (It follows a proposal that Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis first advanced last November to establish a new elections police force with 52 employees.)'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/21/us/jan-6-hearing-trump/rusty-bowers-arizona-trump-jan-6', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Hearings Day 4: Panel Ties Trump to False Electors Plan - The ...', 'Snippet': 'An aide to Senator Ron Johnson tried to arrange for the senator to provide fake electors from Michigan and Wisconsin to Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021. ... of Arizona’s electors for ...', 'Full_text': 'The hearing demonstrated the human costs of the waves of threats and intimidation set off by Mr. Trump and his supporters as they pressured state officials and election workers to find a way to deprive Joseph R. Biden Jr. of his victory.\n\nHere are four takeaways.\n\nTrump was directly involved in the ‘fake electors’ plan.\n\nThe committee showed evidence that Mr. Trump was directly involved behind the scenes in trying to put forward the alternate slates of Trump electors that he hoped could replace the electors awarded to Mr. Biden through his victories in swing states like Arizona and Georgia.\n\nMr. Trump called Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, to ask her to talk to one of his outside lawyers, John Eastman, who was on the line, about the plan, Ms. McDaniel said in a video clip of her deposition to the committee. Mr. Trump wanted Ms. McDaniel, she said, to talk to Mr. Eastman “about the importance of the R.N.C. helping the campaign gather these contingent electors” if Mr. Trump’s legal challenges were successful.\n\nAs Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman were undertaking the scheme, the White House Counsel’s Office held a meeting with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani; the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and other aides, where they were told that the plan was not legally sound, according to recorded testimony from a West Wing aide, Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nThe committee did not say whether Mr. Trump was told about the meeting with the White House Counsel’s Office. Last week, the panel revealed that Mr. Trump had been told by Mr. Eastman that the broader effort they were pursuing to convince Vice President Mike Pence to block or delay certification of the Electoral College count in Mr. Biden’s favor had no legal basis — a fact that legal experts say could help prosecutors build a criminal case against Mr. Trump.\n\nG.O.P. elected officials pushed the electors scheme.\n\nThe committee showed that Republicans in Congress were pushing the alternate electors plan even on Jan. 6, hours before the day’s violence, which had the effect of stopping the certification of the electoral count as Mr. Pence was whisked away from the mob.\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, told an aide for Mr. Pence on Jan. 6 that Mr. Johnson wanted to give Mr. Pence a list of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, two states won by Mr. Biden.\n\n“Johnson needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise,” Sean Riley, an aide to Mr. Johnson, texted an aide to Mr. Pence, according to messages released by the committee.\n\n“What is it?” Chris Hodgson, the aide to Mr. Pence, replied.\n\n“Alternate slate of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Mr. Riley said.\n\n“Do not give that to him,” Mr. Hodgson texted back.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Johnson, Alexa Henning, said on Twitter that he “had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office.”\n\nThe communications with the vice president’s office, she said, were “staff to staff” and the documents were never sent to Mr. Pence.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, another Trump ally on Capitol Hill, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, reached out to Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and a Republican, to see if he would support the decertification of Arizona’s electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Mr. Bowers recounted telling Mr. Biggs.\n\nTrump’s allies could not produce evidence of election fraud.\n\nThe committee showed examples of how Mr. Trump and his allies knew that there was no evidence that the election had been stolen.\n\nMr. Bowers recounted how Mr. Giuliani acknowledged to him at one point in a phone call that they could not find the evidence of fraud that they needed.\n\n“He said, ‘We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence,’” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani telling him. “And I don’t know if that was a gaffe or maybe he didn’t think through what he said, but both myself and others in my group, the three in my group and my counsel, both remembered that specifically, and afterwards, we kind of laughed about it.”\n\nAt another point, Mr. Eastman was pressing Mr. Bowers to embrace the plan to push a slate of Trump electors from Arizona despite the state’s certification of Mr. Biden’s victory there. Mr. Bowers said that he questioned how he could legally participate in the scheme and that Mr. Eastman responded by saying, “Just do it and let the courts sort it out.”\n\nThreats and intimidation started well before Jan. 6.\n\nThe public pressure that Mr. Trump and his allies put on state election officials resulted in the officials being targeted in frightening and intimidating ways by Trump supporters.\n\nShaye Moss, an elections worker in Fulton County, Ga., who, along with her mother, had been falsely accused by Mr. Giuliani of committing election fraud, provided a dramatic portrait of the harassment that Mr. Giuliani’s false claims had spawned. She described the racist messages she received on Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me, telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, ‘Be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Ms. Moss said.\n\nShe said that the entire episode, and the attention that came with it, had “turned my life upside down.”\n\n“I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” she said. “I don’t want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something. I don’t go to the grocery store at all. I haven’t been anywhere at all. I’ve gained about 60 pounds. I just don’t do nothing anymore. I don’t want to go anywhere.”\n\nShe said she loved her job as an election worker but ultimately quit.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, recounted how the home of his son’s widow had been broken into.\n\nMr. Bowers was the target of protests and threats as his daughter was dying. And he described how his office had received over 20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voice mail messages and texts that made it impossible for him and his staff to communicate.\n\n“It is the new pattern or a pattern in our lives to worry what will happen on Saturdays because we have various groups come by and they have had video panel trucks with videos of me proclaiming me to be a pedophile and a pervert and a corrupt politician and blaring loudspeakers in my neighborhood,” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nChris Cameron contributed reporting.\n\nNeither Mr. Holder nor the committee has disclosed the contents of the full trove of videos, and neither has commented on whether it provides substantial new information about Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss.\n\nBut the small piece of it seen by The Times was striking for how it shows Ms. Trump using a different tone in describing her father’s efforts to overturn the outcome than she did in the portion of her deposition to the House committee that has been made public so far.\n\nThe interview for the documentary was conducted on Dec. 10, 2020, the person with access to the video said. That was nine days after a public statement by Attorney General William P. Barr, who declared at the time that there was no widespread fraud impacting the election’s outcome, a rare public rebuke of Mr. Trump’s claims at the time.\n\nIn her recorded interview with the House committee, Ms. Trump said that Mr. Barr’s comments “affected my perspective.”\n\n“I respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he said,” she said. The committee may release additional video of her recorded testimony.\n\nPeople close to Ms. Trump have insisted that she had distanced herself from what was taking place around her father at that time. Those people have said that, after the race was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Trump began focusing on winding down her office and looking toward a new life in Miami.\n\nYet in the video with the filmmaker, Ms. Trump, describing her father’s gains in votes among key demographic groups, had a different reaction when asked whether she had a “take” on her father’s “very clear position on the results and what’s going on.”\n\n“I think that, as the president has said, every single vote needs to be counted and needs to be heard, and he campaigned for the voiceless,” Ms. Trump replied. “And I think a lot of Americans feel very, very disenfranchised right now, and really, question the sanctity of our elections, and that’s not right, it’s not acceptable.”\n\nShe went on, “And he has to take on this fight. Look, you fight for what you love the most and he loves this country and he loves this country’s people, and he wants to make sure that their voice is, is heard and not muted.”\n\nShe said that he “will continue to fight until every legal remedy is exhausted and that’s what he should do.”\n\nAn aide to Ms. Trump did not respond to a message about the new video.\n\nThe filmmaker was connected to Mr. Kushner by Jason Greenblatt, a former lawyer at the Trump Organization and then the White House envoy to the Middle East. The film was envisioned as a legacy project for Mr. Trump, according to two people familiar with how it came about.\n\nMr. Bowers, who spoke about the Constitution in reverential and spiritual terms, had tears in his eyes as he described his gravely ill daughter enduring some of the harassment outside their house. (She died in late January.)\n\n“It was disturbing,” he said. “It was disturbing.”\n\nThe effort to persuade him to take steps to flip the outcome in Arizona to Mr. Trump’s column — the state was won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. — began with pressure from Mr. Trump, and one of his lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who maintained that he had evidence of fraud. “Aren’t we all Republicans here? I would think we would get a better reception,” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani saying at one point.\n\nSoon after Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, certified the state for Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani and an associate, Jenna Ellis, met with Arizona lawmakers, including Mr. Bowers, Mr. Bowers recalled. Mr. Bowers described Ms. Ellis asserting that they had evidence of widespread voter fraud, only to provide none.\n\n“I said, ‘I want the names. Do you have the names of the supposedly dead or fraudulent voters?’” Mr. Bowers said. “She said, ‘Yes.’”\n\nNothing was produced. Eventually, he recalled, Mr. Giuliani said, “We’ve got lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”\n\nMr. Bowers also recalled speaking to Mr. Trump, making clear to the president that he “wouldn’t do anything illegal for him,” as one questioner, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said. Nonetheless, another lawyer advising Mr. Trump, John Eastman, called Mr. Bowers in early January and urged him to schedule a legislative vote to “decertify the electors, because we had plenary authority to do so.”\n\nMr. Eastman, Mr. Bowers testified, said that he should “just do it and let the courts figure it all out.”\n\nMr. Bowers again rejected the push, saying, “I took an oath — for me to take that, to do what you do would be counter to my oath.”\n\nFinally, he testified, there was a call from another Trump supporter, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, when the Electoral College vote was to be confirmed by a joint session of Congress. Mr. Biggs, he said, pushed him again to undo the state’s certification of its electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“We have no legal pathway” to “execute such a request,” Mr. Bowers recalled saying. He also recalled his reaction when he learned that Trump advisers pushed ahead with a scheme to put forward slates of “alternate” electors. “I thought of the book, ‘The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,’” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nMr. Bowers’s personal journal contained an entry in which he said, “I do not want to be a winner by cheating. I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” He was invited to read it into the testimony.\n\nHe was also asked for his reaction to a statement from Mr. Trump criticizing Mr. Bowers’s testimony in advance, in which he claimed that Mr. Bowers had told him the election was “rigged” and that he had won the state.\n\n“I did have a conversation with the president,” Mr. Bowers said. “That certainly isn’t it.”\n\nA moment later, more emphatically, he said, “Anywhere, anyone, any time has said that I said the election was rigged — that would not be true.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/10/politics/arizona-fake-electors-kifle-invs/index.html', 'Headline': 'Arizona fake electors led vocal campaign to overturn the 2020 election ...', 'Snippet': 'But in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across ...', 'Full_text': 'They called it “The Signing.” Eleven fake electors for President Donald Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nInstead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.\n\nMuch attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.\n\nNow those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.\n\n“They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.”\n\nAttorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.\n\n“It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.”\n\nAll 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.\n\nOf the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.\n\nEach of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.\n\n“The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.\n\nElectors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.\n\nCNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.\n\nFive vocal fake electors\n\nThe most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results.\n\n“We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.\n\nWard’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.\n\n“My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22.\n\nAnother prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.\n\n“It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.\n\nIn repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.\n\n“It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.\n\n“We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback.\n\nA spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.\n\nBowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.\n\nThe spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ.\n\nNewly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.\n\n“It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman.\n\nIn interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.\n\nThen-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing “stop the steal” content and participating in their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector.\n\n“On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December.\n\n“There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added.\n\nKern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with CNN.\n\n“Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said.\n\nKern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol.\n\n“In DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in a tweet.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/analysis-arizona-nightmare-scenario-driving-election-reform-rcna41543', 'Headline': ""Analysis: Here's why Arizona is the nightmare scenario ... - NBC News"", 'Snippet': 'Kari Lake, Republican candidate for Arizona governor, waves to supporters prior to speaking at a news conference after the election on Aug. 3, 2022, in Phoenix.', 'Full_text': ""When politicians, legal experts, and activists say they’re worried that the forces behind Jan. 6th could successfully overturn a future election, the picture they have in mind looks an awful lot like what’s shaping up in Arizona.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's preferred candidates, who are closely aligned with his election lies, are on the verge of taking over the state government from top to bottom after Tuesday’s primaries, potentially sweeping positions from governor (still uncalled) to secretary of state, and taking out the Republican speaker of the state house who stood up to the former president’s attempts to throw out election results.\n\nA fully, or even partially, Trumpified Arizona government could have sown chaos had it been in place in 2020 and followed through on demands from the former president and his allies. The governor or secretary of state might have refused to certify an election, or issued conflicting claims. A state legislature built in Trump’s image could have tried to toss out the results and appoint their own electors. All of this would have set up tough votes for Republicans in the House and Senate in response, who already faced threats to both their careers and lives on Jan. 6.\n\nThe Arizona results, along with similar candidates winning nominations in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan, raise the prospect of more forceful attempts at these tactics in 2024 should the Republican presidential nominee lose.\n\nBut this is a nightmare scenario that the House and Senate were already thinking about long before Tuesday’s results. In fact, the Senate held a hearing on Wednesday on a bipartisan bill to reform the Electoral Count Act designed with exactly this case in mind.\n\nWhile not foolproof, election experts advocating for the legislation argue it would provide a potentially strong defense against every one of the above possibilities.\n\nHere’s how it would work: The bill would require states to abide by their pre-election laws for appointing electors, making it harder to ignore the election results. If, say, the Arizona governor certified the results, but the secretary of state or other officials sent a rival slate of electors, only the governor’s would count. If the governor were the one refusing to honor the results, it would provide a direct path for federal courts, and eventually the Supreme Court to weigh in, and direct Congress to accept their decision. It would also clarify the definition of a “failed election” that was a prerequisite for some attempts to overturn the results in state legislatures.\n\n“The bill would limit the ability of both the legislature and the governor to mess with genuine election results,” Rick Hasen, an elections expert at UCLA's law school who has supported the legislation, told NBC News. “If the governor tries to not follow state law in certifying the election for Trump or someone like him, there is a procedure to get courts involved.”\n\nSeparate from the state concerns, the bill also would address “potential for mischief” in Congress, as Genevieve Nadeau, a lawyer with the nonpartisan group Protect Democracy, put it to reporters Wednesday. It raises the threshold for objections to results and clarifies that the vice president can’t overrule results, which were the two immediate triggers for the Jan. 6th protests that ended with rioters storming the Capitol.\n\nThe House is also considering election legislation, and some experts supportive of the Senate bill's goals have raised technical concerns about some provisions. But the Senate version has significant Republican support already and could become law in some form this year. If it does, the unfolding story in Arizona goes a long way to explaining why.""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/arizona-election-changes-ctzn/index.html', 'Headline': 'Arizona is ground zero for election changes | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'Maine Sen.

Rusty Bowers, but the Arizona House speaker has quietly made a name for himself in the state as the stealth killer of his party’s most extreme election ideas.\n\nFirst up was a bill that would have ripped up most voting rules in this battleground state and handed the state legislature the power to reject election results it didn’t like.\n\nIn a bit of parliamentary jiu jitsu, Bowers assigned the bill to 12 committees at once, ensuring it would go nowhere. Its sponsor, GOP state Rep. John Fillmore, called it a “12-committee lynching.”\n\nArizona Mirror journalist Jeremy Duda offered a colorful take – describing Bowers’ takedown as “killing the bill, chopping it up, setting the pieces on fire, then digging up the ashes and throwing them into the ocean.”\n\nThen came Rep. Mark Finchem’s resolution this month on Arizona’s 2020 election results. Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state this year with Trump’s endorsement, makes mostly debunked claims of fraud to call for the results to be set aside in three counties. It includes Maricopa, the state’s most populous county, targeted last year in a problem-plagued ballot review ordered by Republicans in the state Senate.\n\nBowers’ response to the proposal, per The Arizona Republic: “Mr. Finchem’s obviously unconstitutional and profoundly unwise proposal will receive all of the consideration it deserves.”\n\nBowers, a professional painter and sculptor who represents a district east of Phoenix, has a contrarian history – at least when it comes to some of his party’s most outlandish maneuvers in recent years.\n\nHe has described Trump and the then-President’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani calling him after the 2020 election, asking Bowers to somehow inject the legislature into the certification process before the state sent its slate of 11 presidential electors to Congress.\n\nBowers told CNN’s Dianne Gallagher that he voted and campaigned for Trump but rebuffed that. “I said, ‘No, I won’t,’” Bowers recounted in a CNN interview last year, adding, “‘3.5 million people voted here, I’m not gonna unilaterally do that.’”\n\nBowers is term-limited in the Arizona House, and last week announced plans to run for the state Senate.\n\nArizona at ground zero\n\nEven as headline-grabbing election bills falter in Arizona, Republican lawmakers still are weighing a raft of proposals that could alter voting practices in a battleground state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes.\n\nThey include bills that would:\n\nA database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows that Arizona accounts for nearly 10% of all the election-related bills in states this year.\n\nAlex Gulotta, a voting rights activist who runs the Arizona branch of All Voting is Local, said he credits Bowers with “holding the line” to block some of the most blatantly undemocratic ideas floated in the state.\n\nBut, he said, “there are actually a lot of bad things” moving through the legislature “that people are being silent about.”\n\nThe stakes are high in Arizona this year.\n\nVoters will fill an open gubernatorial seat, now held by term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, and decide whether to return one of most vulnerable Senate incumbents, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, to Congress.\n\nThe filing deadline for candidates in Arizona is April 4. The primary election for legislative and statewide offices is slated for August 2.\n\nThe deadline to register to vote in that primary is July 5.\n\nThe state’s full calendar, along with information on how to check your voter registration status if you live in Arizona, can be found here at the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office.\n\nLone star on the horizon\n\nControl of both chambers of Congress and a slew of governorships are on the line in upcoming primaries around the country.

Rand Paul and Roger Marshall came in a hearing on the federal response to the Omicron variant of Covid-19 as the Biden administration faces growing scrutiny alongside record hospitalizations, testing challenges and messaging frustration – issues the GOP has seized on.\n\nEarly in the hearing, after Paul sought to cast Fauci as a “dangerous” government official, the White House chief medical adviser and top infectious disease expert said such rhetoric “kindles the crazies” and has led to threats against his family.\n\n“What happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue is that all of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there and I have life – threats upon my life – harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me,” Fauci said before suggesting the Kentucky Republican was attacking him as a way of raising money.\n\n“So I asked myself, ‘Why would Senator want to do this?’ So, go to Rand Paul website. And you see, ‘Fire Dr. Fauci’ with a little box that says, ‘contribute here,’ you can do $5, $10, $20, $100,” he said. “So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.”\n\nFauci brought a similarly pointed tone to his exchange with Marshall after the Kansas Republican falsely accused him of withholding financial disclosure forms.\n\n“You’re so misinformed, it’s extraordinary,” a visibly frustrated Fauci told Marshall, calling his financial information “public knowledge” for nearly four decades. After the back-and-forth, Fauci could be heard saying, “What a moron. Jesus Christ.”\n\nSpeaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360” Tuesday evening, Fauci said public health officials “should be having to respond to tough questions.”\n\n“And yet, the only thing that came out of Sen. Rand Paul and, to some extent, Sen. Roger Marshall, were ad hominems, which does nothing but distract from what we really need to be doing,” he said.\n\nIn response to the hearing, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN in a statement Tuesday that Republicans on the panel “clearly weren’t trying to stop the spread” of misinformation.\n\n“At a time when America is seeing rising COVID cases, it’s disappointing and frankly unacceptable that Republican Senators chose to spend a hearing with the country’s leading public health experts spreading conspiracy theories and lies about Dr. Fauci, rather than how we protect people from COVID-19,” spokesman Ian Sams said.\n\n“The Biden Administration will continue to focus on getting more Americans vaccinated and boosted and helping Americans get access to the tools to keep themselves and others safe. We would encourage these Republicans to join us.”\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s about three times last winter’s peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to Johns Hopkins.\n\n“Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody,” Fauci told J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, on Tuesday.\n\n“Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/06/17/fauci-rand-paul-covid-boosters-children-mxp-sot-vpx.hln', 'Headline': '‘Are you gonna let me answer a question?’: Fauci and Paul face off in ...', 'Snippet': 'During a Senate committee hearing on the ongoing federal response to the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci faced questions from Sen.

""So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.""\n\nPaul said earlier in the hearing that an email exchange between Fauci and Dr. Francis Collins, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, showed Fauci and Collins appearing to disagree with scientists who said the coronavirus originated in a lab in China.\n\n""You know, you\'re going back to that original discussion when I brought together a group of people to look at every possibility with an open mind,"" Fauci said. ""So you\'re not only distorting it, you are completely turning it around, as you usually do.""\n\nPaul said in a statement after the hearing, ""Anyone who dares to question Fauci’s smear campaign against other scientists is accused by Fauci of fomenting violence.""\n\n""As someone who actually was the target of semiautomatic gunfire by a Bernie Sanders supporter, I never once accused Senator Sanders of being responsible for the attack and I resent Fauci avoiding the question by ginning up the idea that his opponents are the cause of threats,"" Paul added.\n\nPaul was referring to a 2017 shooting when Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and three other people were wounded after a gunman opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team as they were holding a practice in Alexandria, Va.\n\nIan Sams, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesman, said in a statement after the hearing: ""When it comes to misinformation, Republicans on the committee clearly weren\'t trying to stop the spread.\n\n""At a time when America is seeing rising COVID cases, it’s disappointing and frankly unacceptable that Republican Senators chose to spend a hearing with the country’s leading public health experts spreading conspiracy theories and lies about Dr. Fauci, rather than how we protect people from COVID-19,"" Sams said.\n\nPaul, a steadfast opponent of Covid mitigation measures and mask mandates, has clashed with Fauci before over other pandemic-related issues. Paul was the first senator known to have contracted the coronavirus when he tested positive in March 2020.\n\nIn July, Paul implied that Fauci had previously lied to Congress and was aware of what the lab in Wuhan, China, was doing with grant money that came from the NIH.\n\nTuesday\'s hearing also sparked a tense exchange between Fauci and Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., about Fauci\'s financial disclosures and investments.\n\nAfter the back-and-forth, Fauci was heard on a hot mic saying: ""What a moron.

Viral online posts distorted his comments to misleadingly claim that half of employees at federal health agencies “are refusing” the vaccines, which Fauci never said.\n\nAt the time, NIAID told us that 67% of the NIH staff were vaccinated, but the “actual number may be higher” because reporting was voluntary.\n\nSee, “Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations,” May 21, 2021\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. But a Gateway Pundit story shared on Facebook in June 2021 declared, “SMOKING GUN: FAUCI LIED, MILLIONS DIED — Fauci Was Informed of Hydroxychloroquine Success in Early 2020 But Lied to Public Instead Despite the Science.”\n\nThe story was based on two emails that were sent to Fauci in February 2020. In one email, two doctors expressed the possibility that the drug could be effective against COVID-19. Fauci forwarded the email to an NIH deputy director who works in microbiology and infectious diseases and wrote: “Please take a look and respond to them. Thanks.”\n\nIn the other email, a pharmacologist made reference to “data from 2005 showing inhibition of SARS infection,” which is a different disease caused by a different coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) from the one that leads to COVID-19. We previously wrote about a 2005 study that found the drug prevented the spread of that SARS virus in cell culture — which is not the same as working in humans.\n\nThose emails are not evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, or that Fauci kept this from the public. In fact, randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The drug was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nA viral social media post falsely claimed that Fauci was “pushing” remdesivir because he “invented” it with Bill Gates and they would profit from its use.\n\nFauci does not hold a patent for remdesivir, and a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told USA Today that the foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of the drug.\n\nSee, “Fauci Didn’t Invent, Won’t Profit from Remdesivir,” May 21, 2020\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nIt is still uncertain how SARS-CoV-2 originated, but many scientists suspect the virus “spilled over” into humans from an animal. There is no evidence the virus was created in a lab, let alone as part of any U.S.-funded research.\n\nA June 2021 Facebook post claimed that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” because of an email he received from Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. In that Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” He mentioned others, too, found “the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\n\nBut Andersen said in his email that more analysis was necessary and “opinions could still change,” which is what later happened.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists that said they determined that the coronavirus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The authors added that they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.”\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nFormer White House trade adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that Fauci “killed a lot of people” by funding some bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is in Wuhan, China, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified.\n\nNIAID did provide a multimillion-dollar grant to fund some of the lab’s research, but the NIH has explained that those experiments could not have led to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because the viruses that were being studied were very different.\n\n“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” then-NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20, 2021, statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”\n\nSee, “Navarro Falsely Links Fauci to Pandemic Origin,” May 19, 2022\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul accused Fauci of lying when Fauci said in a May 2021 Senate hearing that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” But there’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in a July 20, 2021, hearing, about funding gain-of-function research — which the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to “increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.”\n\nFauci has said that the research that was funded “was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,” and the NIH has said the same. The issue is that scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul has posited that Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” if the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research. But there is no proof of a lab leak, and there is evidence that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant could not have caused the pandemic.\n\nSee, “The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,” May 21, 2021, and “Fauci and Paul, Round 2,” July 22, 2021\n\nIn December 2014, the NIH posted a photo of Fauci and former President Barack Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The photo showed Obama speaking about Ebola research with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, and Fauci was shown standing next to Sylvia Burwell, who was the health and human services secretary at the time.\n\nBut the years-old photo was circulated in 2020 along with the false claim that the image showed “Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015,” suggesting a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee, “Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab,'”July 17, 2020\n\nOther Claims\n\nA series of reports in 2021 from a group that opposes federal funding for research relying on animal testing prompted dozens of readers to ask us if Fauci had a history of cruelty to animals, specifically beagles.\n\nThe NIAID admitted to FactCheck.org in a statement that Fauci was involved in the process of awarding funding for a number of research projects that used beagles as test subjects.

The virus was first identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report last month that stated the US intelligence community could not determine whether researchers at the lab who fell ill in the fall of 2019 were infected with Covid-19, but identified safety and security issues at the lab. Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01566-0', 'Headline': 'NIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research - Nature', 'Snippet': 'NIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research EcoHealth Alliance lost funding during the Trump administration, but can now proceed with its research — under extensive restrictions. By', 'Full_text': 'The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has reinstated a grant to a highly scrutinized research organization that studies bat coronaviruses — but the agency has placed several stipulations on the scope of the research and on the organization’s accounting practices.\n\nThe move caps a years-long saga that has thrust the EcoHealth Alliance, a small non-profit organization in New York City, into the political fray for its collaborations with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China. In April 2020, after then-US-president Donald Trump hinted that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a WIV laboratory, the NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant. Its goal was to study how coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, jump from bats to humans. A few months later, the NIH reinstated and immediately suspended the award until certain conditions were met that, at the time, EcoHealth said were impossible to complete.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature applaud the renewal, adding that this type of research is essential to avert the next pandemic. They claim that the NIH’s termination and subsequent suspension were politically motivated, and that, although long overdue, this renewal ends — for now — a drama-filled exchange between the agency and EcoHealth.\n\n“It’s about goddam time,” says Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, who organized researchers to push back against EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020. “The integrity of science requires a barrier against political interference,” he says.\n\nThe NIH “routinely considers processes and measures for strengthening [its] oversight over federal funds” and has been working with EcoHealth to strengthen its “administrative processes to meet NIH’s expectations”, says Amanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Washington DC.\n\nLengthy list of conditions\n\nAlthough the organization will now be able to continue its bat coronavirus research for the first time since the saga began, the NIH placed an extensive list of restrictions on the four-year, US$2.9-million award. None of the researchers who spoke to Nature had ever seen a grant with so many stipulations.\n\nAmong other things, EcoHealth is specifically forbidden from performing any in-country research in China, including with the WIV, or collecting any new samples from vertebrates — such as bats. The revised grant also mandates greater scrutiny of EcoHealth’s finances and accounting practices, driven in part by a federal watchdog report, released in January, finding that EcoHealth had misreported about $90,000 in expenses. The report also faulted the NIH for improperly terminating EcoHealth’s grant.\n\nFurthermore, EcoHealth will be forbidden from performing any work that is deemed by the NIH’s parent organization, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to have the potential to enhance the virulence or transmission of a virus. This restriction stems, in part, from criticism that research done at the WIV and funded by an EcoHealth subaward qualified as ‘gain of function’ research.\n\nDisputed research\n\nCongressional Republicans have alleged that this research, which involved attaching spike proteins from wild bat coronaviruses to an unrelated virus to determine whether the wild pathogens could infect human airway cells, should have undergone HHS review. Anthony Fauci, then-director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the agency concluded that these experiments did not meet the bar to undergo such review, and noted that the WIV did not intend to enhance the viruses.\n\nTens of thousands of people exposed to bat coronaviruses each year\n\nVirologists say this type of research is essential for developing vaccines and therapeutics against emerging pathogens and for understanding how likely a pathogen is to spark a pandemic. The NIH and HHS have been finalizing guidance that will probably tighten the oversight of such research in the United States.\n\n“I don’t know if any other single grantee from NIH has been subjected to this level of oversight,” says Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance. Yet he is “positive and optimistic” about the grant restart, despite all the restrictions. A key priority for the newly released funds will be analysing nearly 300 partial or complete genomes of SARS-related coronaviruses from samples that the organization collected before the funding halt, he says.\n\nThird rail of virology\n\nThese restrictions seem reasonable, in light of the enormous public attention to and scrutiny of gain-of-function research, says Lawrence Gostin, a health-law and policy specialist at Georgetown University in Washington DC. Still, Gostin says he is surprised the agency restarted its funding for EcoHealth, given that it has been the “third rail of politics” the past few years.\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, says she is pleasantly surprised to see the grant renewed, but worries about the “terrible precedent” that the NIH set by “arbitrarily” terminating an award on the basis of “unfounded rumours” regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2. She hopes that these same restrictions will not apply to other scientists doing similar work, but is encouraged by the number of research groups that are now studying coronaviruses following the COVID-19 pandemic.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.statnews.com/2022/10/18/bu-lab-wasnt-required-to-clear-potentially-controversial-study-with-nih-director-says/', 'Headline': 'BU lab wasn’t required to clear Covid study with NIH, director says', 'Snippet': 'The director of a Boston University laboratory that conducted potentially controversial research on the viruses that cause Covid-19 said his institution didn’t clear the work with the NIH ...', 'Full_text': ""The director of a Boston University laboratory that conducted potentially controversial research on the viruses that cause Covid-19 said his institution didn’t clear the work with the National Institutes of Health because it wasn’t funded by the federal agency.\n\nRonald Corley said the research, which was designed to explore what makes some SARS-CoV-2 viruses more pathogenic than others, was paid for with money from the university itself. The work was approved by the institutional biosafety committee of BU’s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, and by Boston’s Public Health Commission.\n\nadvertisement\n\nScientists from the BU facility posted results from their work in a preprint, a study that has yet to go through peer review. The British tabloid The Daily Mail published an explosive article about the work on Monday, suggesting the group had fabricated a more dangerous version of the SARS-2 Omicron variant.\n\nIn response to questioning from STAT, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which had awarded two grants to the research group, said on Monday that it should have been informed about the nature of the work beforehand, in order for a review to be conducted.\n\nNewsletters\n\nSign up for Daily Recap\n\nA roundup of STAT's top stories of the day.\n\nPlease enter a valid email address.\n\nEmily Erbelding, director of NIAID’s division of microbiology and infectious diseases, said that is the policy set out in what’s known as the P3CO framework, which lays out the rules for work that could lead to enhancement of dangerous pathogens.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“What we would have wanted to do is to talk about exactly what they wanted to do in advance, and if it met what the P3CO framework defines as enhanced pathogen of pandemic potential, ePPP, we could have put a package forward for review by the committee that’s convened by HHS, the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response. That’s what the framework lays out and that’s what we would have done,” she said.\n\nBut the policy only applies to work of this type that is funded by the federal government. And NIAID money was not used for this research, Corley said.\n\nSome funding from NIAID went towards work that might be considered foundational to the questioned research. Corley said the team used some of the federal funds to develop a system for making plasmids it would need to do the later work.\n\nHe acknowledged it can be difficult to see where lines are drawn, when research groups are using different pots of money to fund their work.\n\n“It is a murky world, but in our view because the funding was not supporting the work that was supported in this paper, that it wasn’t necessary to report it to NIH,” he said.\n\nSTAT asked the NIAID if it was satisfied with Boston University’s response. The agency’s response, received by email on Tuesday evening, did not directly answer the question, though it indicated the situation is still being investigated.\n\n“NIH is examining the matter to determine whether the research conducted was subject to the NIH Grants Policy Statement or met the criteria for review under the HHS Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (HHS P3CO framework),” the statement said.\n\nCorley also challenged the notion that the work done by scientist Mohsan Saeed and colleagues was what is known as “gain of function” research. The group created a hybrid or chimeric virus — in which the spike protein of an Omicron version of SARS-2 was fused to a virus of the Wuhan strain, the original version that emerged from China in 2020. Omicron viruses first emerged in late 2021 and have since splintered into multiple different subvariants.\n\nThe purpose of the work was to see if the mutations in the Omicron spike protein were responsible for the lower rate of severity caused by Omicron viruses.\n\nThe testing actually showed, though, that the chimeric virus was more lethal to a type of lab mice than Omicron itself, killing 80% of the mice infected. But the original Wuhan strain killed 100% of mice it was tested in. That suggests that the spike protein itself is not responsible for the pathogenicity of SARS-2 viruses, Corley said.\n\nHe noted that because the chimeric virus was less dangerous in mice than the original strain, this work could not be characterized as gain of function research. That is unlikely to assuage critics of the work, who may argue that the Wuhan strain is not the right benchmark to use as a comparison, given that it no longer circulates. The chimeric virus was more pathogenic than the currently circulating SARS-2 viruses, which are Omicron variants.\n\nBut it is important to note that the severity in the species of mice used in the experiment is not reflective of what happens in people. All of the mice exposed to the original SARS-2 viruses died. Less than 1% of people who contracted those viruses died.\n\nCorley said that BU safety protocols require that if researchers produce a pathogen that is more virulent than the Wuhan strains, they must immediately report it to the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Saeed’s study protocol further stipulated that if such an event occurred, he would immediately stop the work and destroy the viruses, Corley noted.\n\nSTAT approached Saeed for an interview but he did not respond to the request.\n\nCorley said the principal investigators of the study — Saeed is one of two — spoke Tuesday with their program managers at the NIH.\n\n“They support the work that we’re doing and we certainly want to make sure that we are on comfortable ground,” Corley said.\n\n— This article has been updated with a comment from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.""}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/covid-origins-researchers-house-subcommittee-hearing/index.html', 'Headline': 'Scientists at House hearing refute claims they were bribed and ...', 'Snippet': 'Members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei, Province on January 11 ...', 'Full_text': 'Democrats on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic said they aimed to use a hearing Tuesday to set the record straight on Republicans’ claims that Drs. Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins steered scientists investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic away from the idea that the virus was created in a lab in Wuhan, China.\n\nIn a report released in advance of the hearing, Democrats highlighted sworn testimony by authors of the “Proximal Origin” paper that was published in March 2020 in the journal Nature – the paper that first concluded that the pandemic was most likely caused by a viral spillover event from animals to humans.\n\nThat testimony, they said, shows that Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British biomedical scientist who was then director of the Wellcome Trust health research charity and is now chief scientist for the World Health Organization, organized and led the scientific effort that produced both that paper and the February conference call that laid the groundwork for it, rather than Fauci or Collins. Fauci was then head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Collins was head of the National Institutes of Health. Both played critical roles in the nation’s pandemic response.\n\nThe conference call and the paper have become fodder for conspiracy theories claiming that Fauci and Collins pressured scientists to abandon the “lab leak” theory in favor of the natural origins hypothesis.\n\nDr. Kristian Andersen, who studies the genetics of infectious diseases at the Scripps Research Institute, testified Tuesday that in the early days of the pandemic, he first thought the virus that causes Covid-19 had genomic features that might have pointed to laboratory manipulation.\n\n“My initial hypothesis was that SARS-CoV-2 was likely an engineered virus,” Andersen told the committee. “This was based on limited data and preliminary analyses where I had observed features that appeared to be unique.”\n\nHe shared those early concerns with Fauci, who advised him to draft a scientific paper outlining his theory. But Andersen said he changed his mind after learning more about these kinds of viruses.\n\n“We soon discovered that those features are readily found in related coronaviruses, and the virus itself looks to be a clear product of natural selection and not actual engineering,” he said.\n\nHe said scientists often adjust their thinking in the face of evidence. It’s not a flip-flop but how the scientific process works.\n\nAndersen, who said he found his name on online “kill lists” because of allegations that he was part of a coverup, also disputed allegations that he and his co-authors were bribed to change their public statements with promises of grant money.\n\n“It has also been suggested that a grant awarded to myself and colleagues from five different countries was a quid pro quo for changing our conclusions. These allegations are false,” he said.\n\nRepublicans on the committee weren’t happy with those explanations.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican, pressed Andersen to explain the change in his thinking.\n\n“Within a matter of days, something changed,” she said, between Andersen’s emails and calls to Fauci in late January 2020 and the February 1, 2020, conference call with about a dozen other researchers from around the world. “And that’s what this committee is trying to get to the bottom of. What happened within that three-day period between the conference call and the paper that all of a sudden you did a 180, and it couldn’t possibly come from a lab?” she asked. “What happened in those three days?”\n\nDr. Robert Garry, a microbiologist and immunologist at Tulane University, explained that they examined the genomes of other coronaviruses.\n\n“Well, we examined the genomes more closely. We looked at other coronaviruses. And there was some new data that came. There was the data come from the scientific literature,” he said.\n\nGarry said the publication of a similar coronavirus isolated from animals called pangolins showed some of the same changes as the virus that eventually infected humans.\n\n“It was a very important piece of data, because it showed that a lot of the theories about the virus having been engineered or put together in a laboratory were not true, because here was a virus in nature that had a receptor-binding domain with exactly” the same features, he said.\n\nAndersen said the genetic adaptation that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans was “suboptimal,” suggesting to him that it was of natural origin. If the virus had been engineered in a lab, he said, the changes probably would have been more precise.\n\nAndersen also pushed back on the timeline repeated by Republicans on the committee: He said he didn’t change his mind in three days but within about 45 days, as he drafted the Nature paper.\n\nBoth scientists said that if convincing evidence were to emerge that supported the theory that the virus came from lab manipulation, they would consider it.\n\n“It is still my opinion that there is no credible scientific evidence for a lab-based origin for SARS-CoV-2,” Garry said.\n\nRep. John Joyce, a Republican physician from Pennsylvania, asked how some US intelligence agencies – namely the Department of Energy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation – had concluded that the virus probably came from a lab.\n\n“Dr. Andersen, you also said in your testimony, ‘we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,’ and yet two conclusions by the Department of Energy and the FBI directly contradict your position. How do you bring that together?” Joyce said.\n\n“I think you could say that our conclusions completely contradict their conclusions, too,” Andersen said. “I think it’s important to understand that we’re looking at different things here. You’re talking about the intelligence community. If you look at the scientific literature, the scientific evidence for this pointing to a single market in the middle of Wuhan is overwhelming.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Raul Ruiz, an ER doctor who is ranking member of the committee, said that months of the panel’s work had been a biased effort that had shed no additional light on the pandemic’s origins but had sown mistrust in science and the nation’s scientists.\n\n“We have undertaken all of this work, but to what end? Has targeting these researchers and probing the publication of this paper meaningfully advanced our efforts to prevent and prepare for future pandemics?” he asked.\n\n“Or has it been about fishing for evidence to prove their confirmation bias, their theories with a goal of advancing a predetermined partisan narrative targeting Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins and our nation’s scientists and public health officials.”\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, chided her Republican colleagues for feeding public hatred of scientists and public servants.\n\n“I am so offended by some of the things I’ve heard today, of baseless allegations against our nation’s scientists, our public health experts, including Drs. Fauci and Collins, and instead of being on a mission to destroy two people, I wish we were on a mission to get the facts,” she said.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://thebulletin.org/2022/08/nih-to-terminate-ecohealth-alliance-grant-after-its-wuhan-partners-refuse-to-deliver-information-on-coronavirus-studies/', 'Headline': 'NIH to terminate part of EcoHealth Alliance grant after its Wuhan ...', 'Snippet': 'In an Aug. 19 letter to Kentucky Rep James Comer, the top Republican member of the US House Oversight Committee, Michael Lauer, the deputy director of extramural research at NIH, said the agency had informed EcoHealth that it was terminating the sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology “for failure to meet award terms and conditions ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institute of Health (NIH) is partially terminating a grant to a nonprofit that worked extensively with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on bat coronavirus research.

The agency then asked for lab notebooks and other files pertaining to the experiments, and EcoHealth reported that it would relay the request to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the new NIH letters, the Wuhan institute never delivered.\n\n“NIH has requested on two occasions that [EcoHealth] provide NIH the laboratory notebooks and original electronic files from the research conducted at [the Wuhan Institute of Virology]. To date, [the institute] has not provided these records,” Lauer told Comer. NIH verified to the Bulletin that the letters were authentic.\n\nA letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide the requested records, and [EcoHealth’s] failure to include the required terms in [the] subaward agreement represent material failures to comply with the terms of award,” the letter said.\n\nBetween June 2017 and May 2019, scientists working on EcoHealth’s grant tested genetically engineered coronaviruses with the backbone of one virus and the spike proteins—which bind to host cells—of another on mice that expressed human cell receptors. In one case, the NIH reported last fall, one of the chimeric viruses caused mice to become “sicker.” EcoHealth reports show that in the infection experiments, conducted in years four and five of the grant, chimeric viruses replicated faster in mice lungs and killed a higher percentage of mice than the unmodified virus. Last fall, the NIH said that EcoHealth was supposed to report the increased viral growth to the agency “immediately” to assess whether further biosafety measures were necessary.\n\nThe NIH said the Wuhan institute’s experiments under the EcoHealth grant involved viruses that were too genetically distant to have evolved to become SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But some critics of so-called gain-of-function experimentation—in which pathogens are enhanced in way that makes them, say, more transmissible—have said last fall’s revelations point to risky research projects being undertaken at the laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the first reported cases of COVID were reported. Research published recently in Science points to the pandemic having sprung from a seafood market in the city where animals that could have harbored coronavirus infections were kept. That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth has not responded to a request for comment about NIH’s decision to partially terminate its grant.\n\nAccording to the new NIH letters, EcoHealth can work with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to revise the grants without involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If that is not possible, the NIH will ask that the grant be “bilaterally terminated.” Should a reworked grant be possible, the agency will add new terms to it, including increased NIH oversight over EcoHealth for at least three years and increased reporting requirements for the nonprofit.

For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated.

These are funds that a primary grant recipient can give to a collaborator to perform research on their behalf. The biomedical funder’s policy, set to go into effect on 1 October, specifies that foreign subaward recipients, in particular, will be subject to extra scrutiny.\n\nForeign collaborators will have to provide copies of all relevant laboratory notebooks, data and documentation to the primary recipient every few months. The NIH also reserves the right to request access to this supporting documentation as part of its oversight responsibilities.\n\nNIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research\n\nThe NIH’s dealings with foreign researchers have drawn attention as debate rages over whether the COVID-19 pandemic started with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 passing from animals to humans or from a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China, which is located in the city where early cases were detected.\n\nThe non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, based in New York City, has been especially scrutinized. It had received NIH funds to study coronaviruses, and the WIV received a subaward on this grant to study bat coronaviruses in the wild and their potential to infect people. Part of this work involved creating hybrid bat coronaviruses, which some critics have decried as risky ‘gain of function’ research. (On the basis of EcoHealth’s grant application, the NIH determined that this study didn’t meet the bar for risky research.)\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature worry that the change to the NIH’s subawards policy will have a chilling effect on international collaborations; foreign researchers might forgo partnerships because of the requirements. They also say that scientists will have to spend an unreasonable amount of time on administrative tasks to comply with the policy.\n\nThe policy is “heavy handed” and disrespectful to international collaborators, says Sheela Shenoi, an infectious-disease physician at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “It suggests that international collaborators need additional oversight — that they don’t have capacity to do their own research in a rigorous and robust way.”\n\nAmanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, responds that this provision “empowers primary recipients to obtain, on a regular basis, records and data from foreign subrecipients without having to worry that they will not be able to access materials when needed”. She adds: “As part of high-quality science, there should be a free flow of information, documents and data.”\n\nUnder fire\n\nThe NIH has come under fire from federal auditors for, among other things, its handling of the EcoHealth grant. When it first funded EcoHealth, the NIH instructed the organization to report any evidence of unexpected transmissibility or virulence of the hybrid viruses. A progress report from EcoHealth was two years late owing to a miscommunication and a technical glitch, the organization has said. Federal auditors have criticized the NIH for not pursuing the late report and recommended that the agency intensify its monitoring of foreign subaward recipients.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nThe NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant in 2020, but then said it would reinstate it if EcoHealth could meet certain conditions, including obtaining the WIV’s lab notebooks. In part because EcoHealth was unable to do so, last August the NIH terminated the subaward altogether.\n\nPeter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, responds that oversight of federally funded research is important, but that the subaward policy might have unintended consequences that are counter to its mission. “This might lead to countries cutting collaborative ties with US scientists, rather than handing over their laboratory notebooks,” he says. “This would weaken America’s pandemic preparedness at the very time when we need to be developing partnerships in regions where the next pandemic is most likely to originate.”\n\nConcerns voiced\n\nResearchers have condemned the policy’s focus on foreign subrecipients. Stefano Bertuzzi, chief executive of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington DC, says he supports extra accountability and oversight for subawards, but he is “puzzled by why only foreign entities are singled out”.\n\nA virologist from Brazil, who requested anonymity out of fear that their chances of receiving funding could be harmed, says the policy adds a layer of bureaucracy, crafted with politics — not science — in mind.\n\n‘Heinous!’: Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions\n\nIn addition to concerns about international partnerships, Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, says that the policy imposes an administrative burden without providing more funding to meet the requirements. Keusch organized researchers to protest EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020.\n\nFor some researchers, this isn’t a trivial matter. Oleksandr Zeziulin, a specialist in drug abuse and mental health at the Ukrainian Institute on Public Health Policy in Kyiv, says that, because of Russia’s invasion last year, Ukraine has been struggling with constant power outages. “During the winter, we were struggling with our normal schedule, and we’re expecting the same next winter, given Russia’s attacks on power plants,” says Zeziulin, who is a subrecipient of a grant with Shenoi. “If this policy will require an extra 10% of our time, I think it’s going to be [difficult], given the situation we’re in.”\n\nNot all researchers think the policy is unreasonable, however. David Relman, a microbiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, says it addresses concerns that “US expectations and standards for research reproducibility and transparency may not be shared elsewhere in the world”. But he has concerns that it might discourage international collaborations and worries that it’s unclear which elements of lab notebooks would need to be shared. He calls on the NIH to clarify this provision and to clearly communicate to the research community the motivations and goals of the policy.\n\nThe ambiguity could mean that the policy will face legal challenges in some countries, says the Brazilian virologist. Many researchers work on several overlapping research projects from various funders, and some countries carefully safeguard data — for instance, biodiversity data in Brazil — that will be difficult to keep separate.\n\nThe agency is accepting comments on the policy until 26 June, but it’s unclear whether it will make revisions based on feedback. Fine says: “These changes have been made, they are not proposed.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/23/at-a-time-when-the-u-s-needed-covid-19-dialogue-between-scientists-francis-collins-moved-to-shut-it-down/', 'Headline': ""NIH director Francis Collins wanted a 'take-down' to stifle ... - STAT"", 'Snippet': 'In October 2020, the U.S. needed scientific debate on how best to control Covid-19. NIH director Francis Collins tried to quash it.', 'Full_text': 'This week, emails released through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Institute for Economic Research revealed what I see as worrisome communication between Francis Collins, Anthony Fauci, and others within the National Institutes of Health in the fall of 2020. At issue was the Great Barrington Declaration, an open letter written in October 2020 and eventually signed by thousands of scientists. It argues that Covid-19 policy should focus on protecting the elderly and vulnerable, and largely re-open society and school for others.\n\nAt the time, Americans would have benefited from a broad debate among scientists about the available policy options for controlling the Covid-19 pandemic, and perhaps a bit of compromise. The emails tell us why that isn’t what we got.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAn email written by Collins, the director of the NIH, which was addressed to Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and several others read:\n\nCollins appeared on television this week to confirm that the email was authentic, and that he stood by the message. At the time, he believed the Great Barrington Declaration idea of focused protection would result in more deaths than the alternative view of one-size-fits all restrictions. Collins also confirmed that he believed the three authors of the declaration were “fringe” scientists.\n\nOctober 2020, when Collins wrote that email, was a time fraught with uncertainty. Positive results from Pfizer’s ongoing vaccine trial were still four weeks away. Many Americans were fatigued with ongoing restrictions, either imposed by governments or self-imposed. And two dueling documents — the Great Barrington Declaration and the John Snow Memorandum — were released and garnered thousands of signatures. The declaration argued for focused protection and permitting many people to return to normal life. The memorandum favored prolonged one-size-fits all restrictions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAt the time, I did not take sides, and urged public dialogue between scientists who held both views. We needed “a Covid policy response that engages with people who hold views and perspectives different than our own,” I wrote then.\n\nWhat concerns me about the NIH director’s email and his interview on television is that he appeared unwilling to have this dialogue. Collins’s day job does not make him arbiter of scientific truth, the Pope for all scientists. On questions of unprecedented pandemic policy, he is surely entitled to his opinion — as we all are — but his is just one opinion of many.\n\nWhen it comes to lockdowns or school closures, the answer to the question of whether the benefits exceed the harms and, if so, under what conditions, is far from certain, and scientists will continue to study this for decades. As a good scientist, Collins should have recognized the massive uncertainty around these policies.\n\nCollins’s response to a memo signed by thousands of scientists should not have been to call for an immediate and devastating take down, but to use his pulpit as NIH director to hold a series of public discussions and dialogues. In a world where scientists were trapped in their own homes for months, a series of dialogues — even virtual ones — made available for the broader scientific community, policy makers, and the public would have benefited us all.\n\nIt is possible that through the heat of dialogue, weak premises of the argument for focused protection might have been revealed. But it is also possible that the idea might have attracted even more scientists to devise creative ways to achieve the goal, and who would have recognized the gargantuan trade-offs involved in pandemic policy to date.\n\nIt’s also possible that compromises might have been struck. One tenet of the Great Barrington Declaration was that schools should reopen immediately and broadly. In hindsight, it is now clear that reopening schools could have been done safely, as was done in many European nations in 2020 and in the U.S. in the fall of 2021, even before vaccines became available for children. A public forum between scientists might not have accepted all of the reasoning in the declaration, but might have reached a vital compromise, which would have benefitted millions of children, particularly poor or disadvantaged children — and their parents. Unfortunately, we failed them all.\n\nA dialogue might also have led to better strategies for nursing home residents, the group most decimated by Covid-19. The U.S. did not — but could have — launched a large, registry-based randomized trial in this cohort, similar to the U.K.’s recovery trial. Such a trial might have helped vaccinate more of these at-risk individuals sooner and, with the first hint of vaccine efficacy in November 2020, all participants could have been crossed over to receive vaccines. Other intense strategies to aggressively test nursing home workers may have been proposed and received unanimous support.\n\nJeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School, and I called for dialogue and debate among scientists without demonization in April 2020. I’m disappointed to see a few months later that the NIH director, a man uniquely positioned to foster such a debate, had actively sought to thwart and discredit scientists with alternative ideas to the pandemic response. His ad-hominem comment that the authors were “fringe” was unnecessary and unhelpful. In the weeks that followed, more and more mud would be slung against the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, as well as against scientists who held alternative policy views, and favored more and stronger restrictions. The vitriol ensured that the country would not have the dialogue it so desperately needed.\n\nI must admit that I don’t know what would have happened had scientists been more willing to talk to each other. I believe that the world of social isolation — a world of seeing each other through the Post-it-sized Zoom squares — led to dehumanization and irrational hatred, which led to two entrenched policy poles with little room for compromise.\n\nHad Collins, a man who has contributed greatly to science, chosen dialogue instead of contributing to animosity and combativeness, we might have been in a better place today.\n\nVinay Prasad is a hematologist-oncologist, associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California San Francisco, and author of “Malignant: How Bad Policy and Bad Evidence Harm People with Cancer” (Johns Hopkins University Press, April 2020).'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp2305081', 'Headline': 'The Origins of Covid-19 — Why It Matters (and Why It Doesn’t)', 'Snippet': 'The WHO director-general im- ... failed to adequately oversee an EcoHealth Alliance grant for research into bat viruses at Wuhan Institute of Virology ... controversy has con-tinued.

The pair’s seminal paper in 2005 described how they were able to successfully deliver modified mRNA into the body and trigger an immune response—the kind that trains the immune system for future viral infections. Over the years, their research with mRNA vaccines solved some of the major issues confronting the technique, such as the inflammatory response by the body that involves the production of harmful cytokines. During the pandemic, this mRNA technology led to the production of highly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-causing virus, and particularly ones that were adaptable for large-scale rollout.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

This was “largely due to ... improvements in the technology and this basic discovery.”\n\nKarikó was born in 1955 in Szolnok, Hungary. In 1989 she became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained until 2013. She was a senior vice president at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals—a major manufacturer of an mRNA COVID vaccine—and is now an external consultant for BioNTech. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWeissman was born in 1959 in Lexington, Mass. In 1997 he established his research group at the Perelman School of Medicine. Weissman is Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation.\n\n“The award, to me, is really a victory for vaccines and the potential for vaccines to advance health and improve equity,” says Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccinology professor and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nMany vaccines had been created with weakened or deactivated whole viruses, but in recent decades many researchers have been investigating smaller viral parts, such as viral genetic material: DNA or RNA. When Karikó and Weissman injected the foreign in vitro mRNA into human cells, they found that it created a strong immune reaction that elevated protective antibodies. Subsequent inflammation, as well as enzymes in human blood and cells, would degrade the mRNA, however. Despite these scientific roadblocks, skepticism and difficulties with funding, Karikó and Weissman continued to search for solutions.\n\n“It was nonstop technical hurdles for 25 years,” Weissman reflects. “We couldn’t get funding, Kati [Karikó] kept getting demoted and pushed out. It was very difficult to do this research, but we saw early on the potential and how important RNA was likely to be. And that kept us going. We never gave up.”\n\nThe team found a way to modify mRNA to be less inflammatory—replacing uridine, one of its building block molecules, with a similar molecule called pseudouridine. They also developed a more efficient delivery system that used lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA and help it to enter cells for protein production.\n\n“In the early days of vaccinology, we would take a bacteria, we would take a virus, and we would weaken it, or we would combine it with another antigen. But here this was really a targeted immune system approach, both from the use of the mRNA and the use of the lipid nanoparticle,” Neuzil says. “So, to me, that was quite impressive—that they took an entirely different approach to vaccine delivery.”\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, Karikó and Weissman conducted several animal trials with mRNA vaccines for a variety of different pathogens such as Zika, influenza and HIV. “In every animal model we looked at, HIV was the only one that didn’t work well,” Weissman says. “Just about every single one of them gave us 100 percent protection.”\n\nThe research unlocked a new path for possible therapy and vaccine development—one that would prove critical during the COVID pandemic.\n\nAdapting for a Global Public Health Emergency\n\nWhen SARS-CoV-2 began to spread worldwide, Weissman and Karikó’s mRNA research quickly became a candidate and basis for vaccines against the virus. The mRNA vaccine approach had several advantages, Weissman explains. Only a sequence of the original pathogen was needed rather than an actual piece or full virus. “There’s no growing a virus and inactivating it. It’s a very simple procedure, and that’s because it’s a simple enzymatic reaction,” Weissman says. “It was two months from the sequence being released to the first patients getting the vaccine.”\n\nClinical trials, production and rollout of the vaccines greatly expanded, with companies creating hundreds of millions of doses within a year. “Switching over to COVID, it was just a technical thing,” Karikó told Scientific American in a 2021 interview. “It was already ready.”\n\nThe mRNA COVID vaccines work by injecting the genetic material specifically for SARS-CoV-2’s spike proteins—surface proteins on the virus that allow it to bind to healthy cells. Modified mRNA in the vaccine is taken by cells, which then decode it and produce those spike proteins so that the immune system can better identify and neutralize the real virus in the event of a future infection.\n\n“We’re coming off the worst pandemic in more than a century, and certainly these vaccines contributed to lives saved and to less morbidity,” says Neuzil, who has also been working on mRNA vaccines for malaria. “I think an adaptation of this technology and mRNA vaccines could really be transformative, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, because of the adaptability and flexibility of the platform.”\n\nFuture Therapies\n\nFor future vaccines, the application can be quite broad, Weissman says. When Karikó first became interested in mRNA research, she wasn’t initially seeking to develop vaccines. “I was making this modification in the RNA because I always wanted to develop it for therapies,” she told Scientific American in 2021.\n\nWhile the mRNA technology has helped to tackle the COVID pandemic, a tremendous number of people will benefit from the technology, says Niek Sanders, a principal investigator at Ghent University’s Laboratory of Gene Therapy in Belgium. “It can also be used to treat any disease that is due to a malfunctioning protein as it allows patients produce their own therapeutic proteins,” Sanders says. “Nobel Prizes with such a high impact on society are rare and occur only once in 25 or 50 years.”\n\nWeissman, Karikó and other research groups are already trying to apply the technology to autoimmune diseases, cancers, food and environmental allergies, bacterial diseases and insect-borne diseases. In July Weissman and his colleagues published a paper in Science that showed they could deliver RNA gene-editing machinery directly to bone marrow stem cells. This could be key for treating diseases such as sickle cell anemia, in which stem cells are typically taken from an individual, cultured and treated, and then put back into the body. “Now we can give them an off-the-shelf injection of RNA and cure their disease, and that has applicability to thousands of other bone marrow diseases. And then you can expand that to liver, to lung, to brain, to every other organ therapeutics,” Weissman says. “The potential is just enormous.”\n\nWeissman hopes that the mRNA treatment will be available to sickle cell anemia patients in a year and a half. He also has many mRNA clinical trials underway, including a phase 1 trial for the disease amyloidosis and vaccine trials for HIV, norovirus and malaria. Wiessman’s team is also planning to start clinical trials soon on a pan-coronavirus mRNA vaccine, which could help prevent future coronavirus epidemics.\n\n“The future is now,” Weissman says. “These therapeutics are in people right now.”""}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/02/1202941256/nobel-prize-goes-to-scientists-who-made-mrna-covid-vaccines-possible', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize goes to scientists who made mRNA COVID vaccines possible', 'Snippet': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.', 'Full_text': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nKatalin Karikó and Drew Weissman met at copy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and collaborated for decades to try to find ways to use genetic material called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to make vaccines.\n\nThe scientists discovered that modifying a chemical building block of mRNA kept the immune system from destroying the material and enabled it to instead stimulate protection against viruses.

That’s what I hope,” she tells Nature.\n\nA new chapter\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines developed by Moderna and the Pfizer–BioNTech collaboration deliver mRNA that instructs cells to create copies of a protein that is found on SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, called the spike protein. This stimulates the body to make antibodies that target the protein, as well as triggering other immune responses.\n\nThe tangled history of mRNA vaccines\n\nFor decades, mRNA vaccines were considered unfeasible because the injection of mRNA into the body triggered an immune reaction that immediately broke down the mRNA. In the mid-2000s, working at UPenn, Karikó and Weissman demonstrated that swapping one type of molecule in mRNA, called uridine, with a similar one called pseudouridine bypasses the cells’ innate immune defences1.\n\n“I’m delighted to see them recognized,” says Robin Shattock, a vaccine scientist at Imperial College London who has worked on mRNA vaccines. “Their contribution was really fundamental in the success of the COVID-19 vaccines, and I think will underlie RNA technology for some time to come.”\n\n“They demonstrated that changing the type of the RNA nucleotides within the vaccine altered the way in which cells see it,” said John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist at Imperial College London, in a press statement for the UK Science Media Centre. “This increased the amount of vaccine protein made following the injection of the RNA, effectively increasing the efficiency of the vaccination: more response for less RNA.”\n\n“This discovery has opened a new chapter for medicine,” said Nobel committee member Qiang Pan Hammarström, an immunologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, at a press conference after the prize announcement. “Investment in long-term basic research is very important.”\n\nVaccine revolution\n\nThere are now mRNA vaccines in development for a number of other diseases, including influenza, HIV, malaria and Zika.\n\n“It’s really like a revolution starting since the COVID pandemic,” says Rein Verbeke, an mRNA vaccine researcher at Ghent University in Belgium. He adds that Karikó and Weissman’s contributions were essential to the vaccines’ success during the pandemic, and beyond. “Their part was really crucial to the development of this platform.”\n\nA COVID-19 mRNA vaccine containing unmodified RNA, developed by CureVac, based in Tübingen, Germany, was widely seen as a flop after its mediocre performance in clinical trials.\n\nCOVID advances win US$3-million Breakthrough prizes\n\nAnother key component of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was the lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that surround the modified RNA and ease its entry into cells. Numerous scientists contributed to the development of LNPs, says Verbeke, and it would have been nice if the Nobel committee had also recognized their contributions to mRNA vaccines. The modification of mRNA and the development of LNPs “were the two major steps that were necessary to have mRNA vaccines working”, he says.\n\nMany people were involved in developing LNPs, however, and it would be difficult to single out any one contribution, says Pierre Meulien, who worked on using mRNA to trigger immune responses in the 1990s at Transgène, a small biotech firm near Strasbourg in France. Karikó and Weissman “really created the key to success of the whole enterprise around mRNA vaccines”, he adds.\n\nThe development of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics is still in its infancy, says Shattock. Scientists and biotechnology companies are busy coming up with new applications for mRNA technology, from cancer treatments to next-generation COVID-19 vaccines. Many teams are also working on improved ways of delivering mRNA. “What we see used today is not what’s going to be used in the future,” he says. “We’re at the beginning of an RNA revolution.”\n\nAlthough COVID-19 jabs put mRNA vaccines on the map, the technology’s impact is likely to reach far and wide, says Karikó. “It is just limitless.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-10-02/kariko-weissman-mrna-covid-vaccine-nobel-prize', 'Headline': 'Scientists whose work paved way for COVID vaccines win Nobel - Los ...', 'Snippet': 'The mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were both designed within weeks of the release of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome, and were the first to come off manufacturing lines for ...', 'Full_text': 'Katalin Karikó and Dr. Drew Weissman, American scientists whose long collaboration has revolutionized the making of vaccines and raised the prospect of new treatments for a range of afflictions, were awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine Monday for their work on messenger RNA.\n\nHungarian-born biochemist Karikó, 68, spent nearly a decade at BioNTech, the German pharmaceutical firm that collaborated with drug giant Pfizer to produce the COVID-19 pandemic’s first vaccine against the virus that causes COVID-19. Physician-scientist Weissman, 64, is a professor of vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nTheir work has armed scientists and drug companies with the means to turn the body’s cells into manufacturers of its own medicine.\n\n“This year’s Nobel Prize recognizes their basic science discovery that fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with the immune system and had a major impact on society during the recent pandemic,” said Rickard Sandberg, a member of the Nobel Assembly, noting that mRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 shots, “have been administered over 13 billion times.”\n\nThomas Perlmann, the secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly, said both Karikó and Weissman were “overwhelmed” when he notified them of the award, especially Karikó, given her tumultuous professional history.\n\n“Ten years ago, she told me that she was terminated from her current position and had to move to Germany for another position without her family and so forth,” Perlmann said. “So it’s been a dramatic change in her circumstances.”\n\nAlthough mRNA rose to public prominence for its use in COVID-19 vaccines, the technology is expected to become a major basis for flu vaccines, enabling shorter lead times and more accurate matching between circulating influenza strains and yearly shots.\n\nBeyond that, it could play a key role in treating sickle-cell disease and shows promise for the autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis. Its potential use in treating cancers is also opening new avenues for arming the immune system against malignancy.\n\nHIV could be the next target. Three new experimental vaccines to protect against HIV infection, all based on an mRNA design similar to that used in the COVID-19 jab, are now undergoing early human clinical trials.\n\nThe techniques pioneered by Karikó and Weissman have enabled scientists to nimbly customize the proteins targeted by vaccines, a key for thwarting shape-shifting viruses such as the coronavirus and HIV.\n\nSuch capabilities more than proved their worth during the pandemic. The mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were both designed within weeks of the release of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome, and were the first to come off manufacturing lines for worldwide use. Today, the two COVID-19 vaccines are in use in at least 164 countries, and roughly 270 million Americans have received at least one dose.\n\nThat “impressive success story” alone would make recognition of Karikó and Weissman by the Nobel Committee “proper and appropriate,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to President Biden. But advances the pair made in the use of mRNA have only begun to be felt in medicine, he added.\n\nKarikó was first introduced to ribonucleic acid, or RNA, in 1978 and said she’s been “passionate about this fragile molecule ever since.” She was exploring DNA’s use of messenger RNA to deliver specific work orders to cells when she met Weissman over a photocopy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1997.\n\nAntiretroviral medications were just entering wide use against HIV/AIDS at the time, and Weissman was trying to design a vaccine against a disease that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. He had been intrigued by the possibility that mRNA could induce cells to produce proteins that the body was missing or that it needed to heal itself. But he knew that efforts to repurpose this delicate nucleic acid for medical purposes had hit a host of stumbling blocks.\n\nKarikó was intimately familiar with the obstacles to mRNA’s use. And she was well aware of the skepticism directed its way by the scientific community. After earning a doctorate in biochemistry at Hungary’s University of Szeged and immigrating to the United States in 1985, she had been determined to find ways to harness mRNA for treatments.\n\nBy the time she met Weissman, Karikó had been an itinerant postdoctoral researcher for more than a decade. At Temple University in Philadelphia, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., and the University of Pennsylvania, she had tried to drum up support for work on mRNA’s biomedical uses. She had a drawer full of rejected grant proposals to show for it.\n\nWeissman’s research pedigree was more promising. A biochemistry major at Brandeis University, Weissman earned his medical degree and a doctorate at Boston University and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship in Fauci’s lab at the National Institutes of Health. While there, he studied a key node of the mammalian immune system — dendritic cells — and their perturbation in HIV/AIDS.\n\nWeissman knew that messenger RNA had an incidental effect on dendritic cells: Their interaction touched off an immune response that ignited dangerous inflammation across the body.\n\nWeissman and Karikó both realized that until that problem could be fixed, mRNA would be of limited biomedical use, and no use at all in making vaccines. There was also the problem of mRNA’s fragility outside of cells: Unpackaged, it was easily chewed up by enzymes, and getting it through cells’ outer walls was no picnic either.\n\nThe two scientists formed a partnership of grit and grace. Over more than two decades, Karikó’s and Weissman’s experiments shed more light on how mRNA could be repurposed to enter cells and safely order up the production of certain proteins. They watched how other nucleic acids snuck past the immune system unnoticed and devised a fix that enabled mRNA to ferry new work orders into cells without causing flares of inflammation.\n\n“Each spark of something interesting, whether a finding we expected — or even more exciting, the ones we didn’t — motivated us to continue,” Weissman said in a speech accepting the 2021 Lasker Award, one of several prestigious scientific honors the pair have won in recent years.\n\n“Together we designed and conducted experiments, often trading emails into the early hours — unable to wait until the next day to share particular findings or ideas,” Weissman said. “We just kept at it.”\n\nBy 2004, the two had produced a paper that detailed their success at reengineering mRNA for use in mammals. In an interview with the journal Cell, the two recalled that their first paper together was rejected by the three premier science journals — Cell, Science and Nature. One reviewer dismissed the work as a mere “incremental improvement” over existing research in the area.\n\nKarikó said she had to look up “incremental” in the dictionary. Undeterred, the pair got their paper published in a specialty journal, Immunity, in 2005. Then they waited for the conference invitations to pour in.\n\n“We sat and stared at the phone, and nothing happened,” Weissman said. After presenting the paper at one conference, Karikó said a fellow scientist came up and asked who had supervised her work — the kind of question no one would ask a man of her age.\n\nNot until 2010, after the pair published findings that further improved the prospects for mRNA’s use, did the medical establishment start to take notice. By 2012, Weismann and Karikó led a team that showed that mRNA, introduced into mice, could prompt the temporary production of red blood cells.\n\n“They had to do some really fancy manipulation to allow it to persist long enough” inside the body to ferry genetic instructions into cells, Fauci said. “They were persistent, resilient, and they stuck to it,” he added. “It’s a great example of the scientific process.”\n\nIn 2013, Karikó left the University of Pennsylvania to join BioNTech, reasoning that pharmaceutical companies would eclipse universities in devising treatments using mRNA technology.\n\nWhen the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in China in 2019, BioNTech had already used mRNA technology to design a vaccine against the Zika virus, which had infected hundreds of thousands of pregnant women and caused grievous birth defects across the world. Moderna, too, had been working on a Zika vaccine, as well as vaccines against cytomegalovirus infection and cancers.\n\nWithin two weeks of the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ genetic sequence, both companies had what they needed to build a vaccine. They used different formulations for the delivery of mRNA, but once inside a human cell, the vaccines provided the genetic specifications for producing harmless replicas of the coronavirus’ spike proteins. The human immune system would take it from there.\n\nWhen health officials in the U.S. and United Kingdom ordered up a new crop of COVID-19 booster shots that targeted the Omicron variant, all Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna had to do was insert a key piece of genetic code that matched the desired strains. The updated shots were ready in mere months.\n\nWeissman has established laboratories in Thailand, South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries to devise COVID-19 vaccines that can be produced locally. His research continues to explore ways for mRNA vaccines to provide more enduring protection against COVID-19 by training the immune system to recognize pieces of the virus that are much less prone to mutation.\n\nIn addition, Weissman has joined with other scientists to counter the misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 shots that has made many people unwilling to roll up their sleeves.\n\n“As important as the vaccine is, if you don’t take it, it doesn’t work,” he said in an interview Monday with nobelprize.org, adding that the endorsement from the Nobel committee might help sway some of those who have been hesitant.\n\nHe remains at the University of Pennsylvania, and is married to Mary Ellen Weissman. They have two daughters, Rachel and Allison.\n\nKarikó left BioNTech in 2022 but is still a consultant for the company. She is now a research professor at the University of Szeged and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nKarikó is married to Béla Francia, who she said encouraged her decision to commute to BioNTech in Germany when she lost her position at Penn. The couple and their daughter, Zsuzsanna “Susan” Francia, arrived in the United States in 1985 with their life savings — about $1,000 — sewn into the stuffing of a teddy bear. (Susan Francia grew up to become a decorated rower, winning two Olympic gold medals for the United States.)\n\n“I try to tell fellow female scientists that you don’t have to choose between having a family, you can have it,” she told nobelprize.org on Monday. “Your child will watch you and they will do, because that’s what counts, the example that you present.”\n\nThrough it all, Karikó has said she was not deterred by her lack of funding, the lack of interest from the medical establishment or the slow pace at which she and Weissman uncovered mRNA’s secrets.\n\n“I am so glad it helped humanity,” Karikó told a University of Pennsylvania interviewer. But for decades, the process of scientific discovery was its own reward, she added.\n\n“So many enigmatic things about RNA I find very, very exciting,” Karikó said. She and Weissman would ask questions and then design experiments to answer them.\n\n“And of course, instead of the answer, we got 100 more questions,” she added. “It was very enjoyable. I would like to emphasize that to be a scientist is a joy.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/nobel-prize-medicine-1.6984244', 'Headline': 'Scientists who spurred development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving ...', 'Full_text': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries they made at the University of Pennsylvania that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving body said on Monday.\n\nKariko and Weissman were honoured for ""their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19,"" the body said.\n\n""MRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 vaccines, have been administered over 13 billion times.

""I bragged about how I can do RNA, and Drew was interested in vaccines, and that is how our collaboration started.""\n\nKariko found a way to prevent the immune system from launching an inflammatory reaction against lab-made mRNA, previously seen as a major hurdle against any therapeutic use of mRNA.\n\nTogether with Weissman, she showed in 2005 that adjustments to nucleosides, the molecular letters that write the mRNA\'s genetic code, can keep the mRNA under the immune system\'s radar.\n\n""We couldn\'t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,"" Weissman said on Monday. ""Pretty much everybody gave up on it.""\n\nMessenger or mRNA, discovered in 1961, is a natural molecule that serves as a recipe for the body\'s production of proteins.\n\nThe technology breaks from established biotech medicines, generated in complex reactors by genetically modified living cells, then isolated and purified. Messenger RNA, by contrast, works like a software that can be injected into the body to instruct human cells to churn out the desired proteins. Prospective uses include drugs against cancer and vaccines against malaria, influenza and rabies.\n\nPfizer, in partnership with BioNTech, and Moderna were able to develop mRNA vaccines based on the foundational work conducted by Kariko and Weissman, as well as other scientists, enabling a rapid response as a COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization in mid-March 2020.\n\nSince that time, a vocal anti-vaccine movement has emerged. Olle Kämpe of the Karolinska Institute, responding to a reporter question, said the award would probably not sway those most resistant to receiving vaccines, but that, ""giving a Nobel Prize for this COVID-19 vaccine may make hesitant people take the vaccine and be sure it\'s very efficient and safe.""\n\nGunilla Karlsson Hedestam, also from the institute, said scientists must be transparent and communicate clearly to wider audiences. While the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines were accelerated, she said, it was important for people to undertstand that the origins of the work enabling the development of mRNA vaccines date back to the 1990s.\n\nSir Andrew Pollard, an immunology professor at Oxford University who pursued a different technology when co-developing the lesser-used COVID vaccine by AstraZeneca, said it was ""absolutely right that the ground-breaking work"" done by Kariko and Weissman should be recognized by the Nobel committee.\n\nPeace Prize revealed on Friday\n\nPrizes in physics, chemistry and literature will be announced this week, with the Nobel Peace Prize winner to be revealed on Friday.

Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020. And that success is seeding mRNA-based strategies across a number of different conditions, including other infectious diseases as well as cancer.\n\nKariko’s husband answered the call from Stockholm early in the morning on Oct. 2 at their home in a Philadelphia suburb. She told nobelprize.org that she initially thought “somebody was just joking.” While she said the conversation involved detailed scientific information that would have been hard to fake, “you never know in these days,” she said.\n\nTrue to their long-time partnership, Kariko then called Weissman to break the good news. In fact, the early morning call likely reminded him of years of similar emails he and Kariko would exchange at dawn when they were working to crack the problem of turning mRNA into reliable therapies.\n\nThat collaboration began at the copy machine between their offices at the University of Pennsylvania. Kariko was obsessed with mRNA, which is the part of DNA that codes for proteins, convinced that it would be the key to developing new treatments for heart disease, stroke and other conditions. Few scientists at the time agreed, since RNA was much less stable than DNA, and despite years of dedicated, unflagging research, Kariko had little to show in the form of results.\n\nThen came the chance meeting with Weissman at the copier in 1997. Weissman is an immunologist and physician and had come to Penn from the National Institutes of Health to continue developing a vaccine against HIV. The more gregarious Kariko tried to sell her colleague on the merits of mRNA, and Weissman listened.\n\nTo make mRNA a useful tool for treating people, however, Kariko needed to find a way to suppress its tendency to aggravate the immune system, which ended up creating a dangerous inflammatory reaction and destroying the very mRNA that was supposed to be therapeutic. Their personalities couldn\'t be more different—according to Kariko, Weissman said she tended to zig and zag to generate ideas, while he preferred the more straightforward approach. Still, “we worked side by side,"" said Weissman. But their research wasn\'t popular, either with the leadership at the university, or with the scientific community. ""We couldn’t get funding [for our research] we couldn’t get publications [for our work], we couldn’t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,” Weissman said during a press briefing after the Nobel announcement. “RNA had failed in clinical trials, and pretty much everybody had given up on it.”\n\nBut the over the next decade or so, Kariko and Weissman tenaciously proved the doubters wrong. They eventually figured out that changing one portion of the mRNA code would make it less likely to stimulate the immune system. Not only that, the change also led cells in animals to produce more of the desired protein coded for by the mRNA—exactly what they needed to turn mRNA into a robust vaccine or other treatment.\n\nBut even when the scientists published what they thought was their ground-breaking finding in 2005, the scientific community barely noticed. Doubters still prevailed, and Kariko was “kicked out from Penn, and forced to retire,” she said. Eventually, she was hired by BioNTech, a German biotech that shared Kariko’s vision about the promise of mRNA technology. When reached for comment, a spokesperson at Penn did not directly address the circumstances of Kariko\'s leaving the university.\n\nThat faith was finally borne out when two mRNA-based vaccines, including one made by BioNTech and Pfizer and another by U.S. biotech Moderna, became the first to be authorized and approved to treat SARS-CoV-2, and remain the foundation for the pandemic response. Kariko’s conviction was finally justified—more than two decades later—that mRNA would make an efficient, and potentially more powerful platform for treating disease. Now, researchers are developing mRNA-based vaccines to target other infectious diseases such as mpox and influenza, and the strategy is even showing promise against cancer, as a way to train the immune system to recognize tumors. Because the technology is still so new, scientists are still learning about any side effects of the platform—mRNA vaccines have so far been linked to a slightly higher risk of some heart inflammation, for example—but given that millions of people have received the shots, so far the benefits appear to outweigh the risks.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://sj.jst.go.jp/stories/2023/s1207-02p.html', 'Headline': ""Dr. Katalin Karikó and colleagues highly praised for 'saving millions ..."", 'Snippet': ""The process typically requires 10 years.

The laureates are Dr. Katalin Karikó (68), an advisor to the German biotech company BioNTech and a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the USA, and Dr. Drew Weissman (64), a professor at the same university. In a press conference on October 2, the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden highly praised the research achievements of the two scientists, stating, ""13 billion doses of the vaccine were administered worldwide, and this saved the lives of millions of people, allowing for society to return to normal.""\n\nDr. Karikó and her colleagues developed a technology that allows mRNA to enter the body without triggering an inflammatory response. They achieved this by replacing certain substances that make up mRNA. Based on this technology, BioNTech collaborated with the US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, and US-based Moderna also developed a vaccine with a similar mechanism. At the end of 2020, less than a year from the start of development, the vaccine was put into practical use and has been widely used in various countries worldwide.\n\nDr. Karikó was born in Hungary during the Cold War and learned molecular biology while living a modest life. After struggling to immigrate to the USA, she met Dr. Weissman, and they continued their research together. Karikó was asleep early in the morning when she received the call from the Nobel Foundation. She later attended a press conference at the University of Pennsylvania and encouraged female students to follow in her footsteps.\n\nThe two researcher\'s technology allows for practical use of the vaccine in less than a year\n\nThe novel coronavirus was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In Japan, the first infected person was confirmed in mid-January 2020, after the new year. The disease quickly spread to various European countries, the USA, and Asia. Meanwhile, the viral genome sequence was disclosed to the public shortly after the first confirmation of infection. Less than a year afterward, BioNTech and Pfizer developed mRNA vaccines. In December of the same year, vaccination with the Pfizer−BioNTech vaccine started in the UK, and the vaccine was quickly disseminated worldwide. Vaccination with the Moderna vaccine followed.\n\nVaccines that protect against viral infections have used viral proteins and other substances that are harmless to the human body to date. However, the drawback is that it takes time for such vaccine development and production (i.e., before practical application). The process typically requires 10 years. The accumulation of basic research on mRNA technology by Karikó and her team is behind the rapid practical application of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nmRNA serves as an \'intermediate\' in the synthesis of proteins based on genetic information encoded in DNA. mRNA vaccines take advantage of this property. Instead of injecting the viral protein itself, its \'blueprint\' is injected, allowing spike proteins to be produced in human cells. The host immune system recognizes this protein and produces antibodies to fight the real virus when it enters the body.\n\nEntering the human body through a \'replacement method\' without being recognized as a foreign substance\n\nUsing mRNA to create vaccines has been around since 1990. However, mRNA is easily degraded and is often considered a foreign substance by the body, leading to strong reactions like inflammation. This made its practical application difficult.\n\nAccording to organizations such as the Nobel Foundation, Karikó and Weissman, who were researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, began their comprehensive research in 1997 to solve the problems associated with the development of mRNA vaccines. They discovered that replacing uridine (a common mRNA component) with pseudouridine (a molecule commonly present in transfer RNA [tRNA]) prevents the mRNA from being recognized as a foreign substance in the human body. The paper on this \'replacement method\' was published in 2005. The two researchers repeated countless experiments before making this discovery.\n\nAs explained by a representative from the Karolinska Institutet at the press conference, ""Dr. Karikó, who is knowledgeable on mRNA, and Dr. Weissman, who has a deep knowledge of immunology, advanced their research by complementing each other\'s expertise.""\n\nWhat background did Dr. Karikó and Dr. Weissman each have, and how did they eventually meet and come to share the same fate of achieving research results that would save many people worldwide&quest; Looking at their backgrounds again, Karikó was born in Hungary on January 17, 1955, received her PhD from the University of Szeged in Hungary in 1982, and moved to the USA in 1985 after working at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. She served as a postdoctoral fellow at Temple University in the USA and as a senior research fellow at the University of Pennsylvania before joining BioNTech in 2013. She has concurrently served as a professor at the University of Szeged and a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania since 2021.\n\nWeissman was born in the USA on September 7, 1959, graduated from Brandeis University in 1981, received his PhD in Immunology and Microbiology from Boston University in 1987, and served as an associate professor at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania before becoming a professor in 2013.\n\nKarikó, whose research was terminated in her home country, also faced hardship in the USA\n\nKarikó was awarded the Keio Medical Science Prize in 2021 and the Japan Prize in 2022. She held an online lecture at the \'Science Agora 2021\' conference organized by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) in November 2021. She visited Japan many times for award ceremonies and lectures. In her lectures and media interviews, she looked back on her research career and shared stories regarding the difficulties and hardships she experienced before achieving success in mRNA vaccine research.\n\nAccording to Karikó and documents published about her, she was born in Szolnok, a rural city in Eastern Hungary. The city was devastated by air raids during World War II. However, the city was being rebuilt by the time she was born and growing up. Nonetheless, life was not easy, as supplies were scarce during the Cold War, and there was no running water or television. However, she described her days with her parents (who ran a butcher shop) and her younger sister as ""happy."" As a teenager, she enthusiastically studied biology with her parents\' encouragement. ""I was a curious child. At the age of 16, I decided to become a scientist,"" she mentioned in her acceptance speech for the Keio Medical Science Prize. She then enrolled at the University of Szeged, a university with a long tradition and outstanding achievements, to study molecular biology in depth.\n\nShe received her PhD from the same university and continued her research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. However, in 1985, when she was 30 years old, her research funding was terminated. She searched for research opportunities in European countries and found no institutions willing to accept her. When she found that only Temple University would accept her, she decided to move to the USA with her husband, who was an engineer, and their eldest daughter, who was 2 years old at the time. With only an estimated 200,000-yen equivalent in cash, she made a ""determined journey to the USA"" without considering returning to her homeland.\n\nTaking foreign currency out of Hungary was prohibited at the time. As the story goes, she concealed the cash in her daughter\'s stuffed teddy bear to bring to her new home. Her eldest daughter became a rower in the USA. She won two consecutive gold medals as a US national rowing team member at the Olympic Games in London in 2008 and in Beijing in 2012.\n\nKarikó then moved to the University of Pennsylvania in 1989, where she met Weissman, who was working on an AIDS vaccine. Although she began in-depth research on the medical applications of mRNA, research on fragile mRNA did not gain widespread understanding. She experienced a difficult time when her grant funding was terminated. Nevertheless, she continued her research. However, even after she published a paper on mRNA vaccines in 2005, it initially did not garner much attention. Her research career was never smooth sailing.\n\nInteracting with Japanese researchers, and discoveries made by the late Dr. Yasuhiro Furuichi contribute to Karikó\'s research.\n\nDr. Karikó repeatedly mentioned Dr. Yasuhiro Furuichi in her lectures. Furuichi was a Japanese molecular biologist who passed away in October 2022 at the age of 81. Furuichi graduated from the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Toyama and received his PhD from the Graduate School of the University of Tokyo. He continued his research on mRNA at the National Institute of Genetics, where he discovered the \'cap\' structure at the tip of RNA in the mid-1970s. The structure was named after its cap-resembling shape.\n\nRNA will not function correctly without this structure. Compared with DNA studies, RNA research, especially mRNA research, has been less spectacular. However, mRNA cannot function without the cap structure, and proteins cannot be produced. For this reason, Furuichi\'s work is considered crucial and is said to have led to the practical application of mRNA vaccines. Unfortunately, Furuichi passed away last year without hearing the news of the Nobel Prize awarded to Karikó. However, he must have been pleased to see the worldwide dissemination of antiviral mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBecause of their similar research fields, Karikó had interactions with Professor Keiji Itaka, who conducts research on biofunctional restoration at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, and Professor Ken J Ishii, who specializes in immunology at the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo and is responsible for reviewing Karikó\'s papers. Osaka University posted a message on its website, stating, ""Dr. Karikó has deep connections with researchers at our university, and we at Osaka University, which has strongly promoted this research field for many years, sincerely congratulate both of the two scientists on this honor.""\n\nFurthermore, Director Emeritus/Professor Shinya Yamanaka of the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application at Kyoto University posted the following message on the Center\'s X (formerly Twitter) account: ""Congratulations on your award. I was deeply impressed after hearing that you have been persistent in your research when I had the opportunity to have a conversation with you. Your groundbreaking invention of the mRNA vaccine technology has saved many people.""\n\nMany of her close Japanese acquaintances have expressed their congratulations, and the common impressions they share are her ""friendly personality"" and ""persistence in diligently pursuing comprehensive research.""\n\nA meeting in line for the photocopier leads to discussion on \'research barriers\'\n\nAfter being selected for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2023, Karikó told the Nobel Foundation in a telephone interview, ""At first, I thought someone was making a joke."" When it became clear that it was not a mistake, she and Weissman attended a press conference at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAt a press conference, Karikó happily recounted how she met Weissman while waiting in line for a photocopier in 1997. At that time, there were few photocopiers, and the waiting time became a great opportunity to exchange information. In their research, both researchers faced a wall. ""It was nice to talk about various ideas,"" she said. ""Although our laboratories were in different buildings, it was fun to start working together.""\n\nWeissman stated, ""(When I met Dr. Karikó,) I could not get research funding, and nobody was interested in my research. Clinical trials continued to fail. However, I met her, and we worked together for the next 20 years. We never gave up and persevered in our research patiently.""\n\nWhen asked by the moderator for her advice to female students, researchers, and others following in her footsteps, Karikó replied, ""If you want to be in the spotlight, become an actress. If you want to follow orders, the military would be a good choice. However, if you enjoy solving problems, science is for you.""\n\nHigh expectations for application of vaccines to various infectious diseases and cancer treatments\n\nAt a press conference for the Japan Prize laureates, Karikó mentioned their mRNA research, stating, ""We did not originally intend to create a vaccine. Instead, we continued our research, intending to use it for pharmaceuticals. The research to develop a COVID-19 vaccine stemmed from an ethical obligation (to save those infected).""\n\nAs a result, it protected many people worldwide from COVID-19 infection or from the disease becoming more severe. The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the technology developed by Karikó and her colleagues ""played a crucial role in controlling the pandemic."" There is a high expectation that the technology they develop will have broad applications.\n\nThe Karolinska Institutet expects the technology to be applied to vaccines for malaria, influenza, and other infectious diseases, and cancer treatment. In her lecture explaining the research findings, Karikó presented research on vaccines that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells.\n\nThe institute also highly praised the achievements of the two scientists. However, at the press conference, questions were raised on the safety of mRNA vaccines. In response, a representative of the institute expressed an opinion, stating, ""13 billion people have already been vaccinated, and adverse reactions have been limited, and we do not consider them a significant concern. Actual infection with the novel coronavirus may have a higher risk of long-term health effects."" The representative further noted, ""We need to continue to explain how the mRNA vaccine works (in the body).""\n\nThe Nobel Foundation is known for not awarding any prize in the field of science to research findings that still have safety or ethical concerns. The decision to award a Nobel Prize at this time to the researchers behind the technology of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is a recognition of their safety. However, it means taking on the responsibility of awarding the Prize.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03119-x', 'Headline': 'mRNA COVID vaccines saved lives and won a Nobel - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Pioneers of mRNA COVID vaccines win medicine Nobel.

Yet the field shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nPioneers of mRNA COVID vaccines win medicine Nobel\n\nIn the wake of the technology’s dramatic success in generating quick-turnaround COVID-19 vaccines, investors have poured billions of dollars into expanding mRNA’s therapeutic reach.\n\nThis influx of cash promises to fuel the research and infrastructure needed to deploy mRNA medicines in ways that could transform public health by tackling hard-to-treat infectious diseases, cancers and rare genetic disorders.\n\n“The sky’s the limit,” says Matthias Stephan, an immunologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. “For whatever you want to correct, or whatever you want to treat, there could be an mRNA medicine — that’s the excitement.”\n\nNature spoke to researchers about mRNA medicines that are on the horizon.\n\nCurbing outbreaks: when speed is of the essence\n\nVaccines based on mRNA rose to fame not only for their safety and efficacy, but also for the speed with which they were developed and rolled out during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe approach allows researchers to have “a very potently effective vaccine in arms within weeks”, says Barney Graham, who helped to develop one of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines while at the US National Institutes of Health. (Graham now serves as senior adviser for global health equity at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia.)\n\nHow COVID unlocked the power of RNA vaccines\n\nThe vaccines deliver mRNA that instructs a person’s cells to create copies of viral proteins, also known as antigens. This process stimulates the body to generate protective antibodies and virus-fighting immune cells.\n\nBecause synthetic mRNA can be designed and manufactured in days, the technology allows vaccines to be reformulated quickly each year to address the ever-evolving nature of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Or it can be deployed as a rapid-response tool in the face of new infectious threats. For example, Moderna, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has trialled mRNA vaccines against the monkeypox, Zika and Nipah viruses.\n\n“We can definitely take advantage of the flexibility and simplicity of mRNA vaccine production,” says Norbert Pardi, a vaccine scientist at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in Philadelphia who has worked closely with the winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine — immunologist Drew Weissman, also at UPenn, and biochemist Katalin Karikó at the University of Szeged in Hungary. In the mid-2000s, the two laureates developed some of the foundational technology used to create mRNA vaccines.\n\nWily foes: tackling tough pathogens\n\nCompanies already have mRNA vaccines moving through the pipeline that target familiar pathogens. For instance, Moderna has a jab to protect against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — which causes cold-like symptoms in most people but can be life-threatening to babies and older people — under review at the US Food and Drug Administration. Its public-health impact might be limited, however, because two protein-based vaccines beat it to approval.\n\nThe tangled history of mRNA vaccines\n\nWhere the technology could really make a difference is with pathogens that drug firms haven’t been able to crack. One is cytomegalovirus (CMV), a virus that has eluded vaccine developers for more than 50 years and that causes birth defects in infants, as well as potentially deadly infections in people with compromised immune systems. “This is where mRNA has been quite a game-changer,” says Sallie Permar, a paediatric infectious-disease researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.\n\nCMV uses a bundle of five proteins to enter and exit human cells, an antigen configuration that is difficult for protein-based vaccines to emulate. But with mRNA, researchers can simply provide the genetic instructions that a cell needs to produce the five proteins. The cell itself then does the heavy lifting of properly assembling the subunits into one antigen complex, just as happens during a natural infection.\n\nEarly results1 suggest that Moderna’s CMV vaccine, now in phase III trials, stimulates a stronger immune response in some tissues than do natural infections. “It’s an exciting time to end the most common cause of infectious disability,” says Permar, who has collaborated with Moderna to study the vaccine’s immune potential.\n\nCancer vaccines: the next frontier\n\nThe future of mRNA vaccines is not limited to infectious disease. “The next big thing is cancer, for sure,” says Derrick Rossi, interim chief executive at the New York Stem Cell Foundation in New York City and a co-founder of Moderna.\n\nThe lightning-fast quest for COVID vaccines — and what it means for other diseases\n\nCancer researchers have long sought a vaccine that could be used to train the immune system to fight tumours — only to see promising candidates fail in clinical trials. Cancers have been a tough nut to crack because malignant cells mutate rapidly, weakening therapeutics’ power.\n\nWith mRNA, researchers can develop cancer vaccines that target dozens of antigens on tumour cells simultaneously. Hitting several targets at once could make it harder for cancer cells to evolve ways to evade immune responses elicited by a vaccine. Clinical trials of a new class of personalized cancer vaccine are under way: these vaccines use mRNA aimed at a collection of mutated proteins that are found in an individual’s own tumour.\n\nBut mRNA’s applications in cancer could have a wider reach, says Elad Sharon, an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. “This is broader than just vaccines.”\n\nModerna is testing therapies that deliver mRNA instructions for making immune-stimulating molecules, such as cytokines, in cells to see whether they can amplify the effects of existing cancer immunotherapies2. And BioNTech, a biotechnology company in Mainz, Germany, is developing similar mRNA therapies that coax cells to generate antibodies that can help to rouse an immune response.\n\nGenome editing: improved delivery\n\nWhen researchers began working with mRNA as a therapeutic, the fact that the molecule could degrade quickly made it difficult to work with.\n\nWays of generating longer-lasting mRNA molecules could help. Yet, in some cases, mRNA’s fleeting nature is an advantage. When it comes to genome-editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9, researchers don’t want DNA-cutting enzymes to linger in the cell, because of the potential for unintended edits. mRNA represents a way to shuttle instructions for making the enzymes into cells and have them disappear after they’ve done their job.\n\nCOVID advances win US$3-million Breakthrough prizes\n\n“This is a perfect use of mRNA,” says Rossi, who co-founded a company called Intellia Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that is using mRNA to deliver the gene-editing machinery needed to correct two rare diseases. “You want it around for a short while, you want it to do its job, and then you want it to go away.”\n\nOther companies, including one that Weissman co-founded called Capstan Therapeutics, are deploying mRNA to equip immune cells with enhanced disease-fighting functions. In these applications, the amount of protein elicited from mRNA is just enough to allow efficient editing or reprogramming, but not enough to introduce unwanted effects.\n\nAs researchers develop improved ways of targeting mRNA to desired locations in the body, its potential genome-editing applications will expand, says Lior Zangi, who studies mRNA therapeutics for heart regeneration at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “There’s a real possibility that this will lead to many new drugs for many different diseases,” he says. “That will be the real future.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-in-medicine-awarded-to-mrna-pioneers-heres-how-their-discovery-was-integral-to-covid-vaccine-development-214763', 'Headline': 'Nobel prize in medicine awarded to mRNA pioneers – here’s how their ...', 'Snippet': 'Researchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest.

The rapid development of these vaccines changed the course of the pandemic, providing protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nBut these vaccines would not have been possible it if weren’t for the pioneering work of this year’s winners of the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine decades earlier.\n\nDr Katalin Karikó and Dr Drew Weissman, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, have been given the prestigious award for their discoveries into mRNA biology. The pair were the first to discover a way of modifying mRNA that allowed it to successfully be delivered to cells and replicated by them.\n\nTheir discovery was not only integral to COVID-19 vaccine development, but may also lead to the development of many other therapies – such as vaccines for cancer.\n\nLife’s work\n\nKarikó is a Hungarian biochemist and Weissman an American physician scientist. The two began working together in 1985 when Karikó was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, where Weissman was already working as an immunologist. They had a shared interest in how mRNA could be used to make new therapies.\n\nMessenger RNA (better known as mRNA) is an essential molecule to life. It’s made in the body from our very own DNA in a process called translation. DNA is our special encoded handbook of instructions for manufacturing proteins, which are the building blocks for material in the body.\n\nOur mRNA copies and carries these genetic instructions from our DNA to our cells. The cells then make whatever protein they’ve been instructed to, such as haemoglobin which helps red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.\n\nKarikó and Weissman thought that if it was possible to commandeer this process, mRNA could be used to instruct cells to essentially make their own cures. But at the time they started working together, attempts by other researchers to do this had been unsuccessful.\n\nThe researchers faced two major challenges as they began their work. The first was being able to prevent the host from mounting an immune response against the modified mRNA. The second was being able to deliver the mRNA into the host safely without it degrading.\n\nTo understand how they overcame the first barrier, it’s important to understand mRNA’s structure. Normally, mRNA molecules contain four types of smaller molecules known as bases (nucleosides): A (adenine), U (uridine), G (guanine), and C (cytosine). Different sequences of these bases can be strung together to produce the basis of an mRNA molecule.\n\nIn early experiments, Karikó and Weismann found that injecting normal mRNA molecules into mice led to an immune response. This meant the mouse’s immune system saw the new mRNA as an invading pathogen and the immune cells would destroy it, instead of replicating it.\n\nSo the researchers modified the U nucleoside to create a pseudouridine, a chemical compound which stabilises RNA’s structure. When they repeated their experiment with the modified mRNA, the mice exhibited no immune response.\n\nBut Karikó and Weismann still faced the second challenge of being able to deliver the bespoke mRNA without it degrading.\n\nThey decided to use lipids (a nanoparticle) to deliver it. These fatty chemical compounds are an essential part of the cell membrane, controlling what enters and leaves the cell. Specially created lipids allowed the mRNA molecules to be delivered without being degraded or broken down by the immune system.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s research had successfully eliminated the obstacles that had previously stood in the way of using mRNA clinically. Being able to instruct the body to replicate virtually any harmless protein could have potential for treating a range of diseases and even protect against viral infections.\n\nCOVID vaccines\n\nWhen their research was first published, it didn’t garner much attention. But in 2011, two biotech companies – Moderna and BioNTech – took notice and began research into mRNA medicines.\n\nIt’s no wonder why. Traditional vaccine production methods are time consuming, expensive and don’t work for every vaccine. But Karikó and Weissman’s work showed that synthetic mRNA could be made at a large scale.\n\nResearchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest. But in 2020, when COVID-19 began spreading around the globe, vaccines were needed quickly to offer protection.\n\nUsing the foundational work of Karikó and Weissman, scientists developed a bespoke mRNA sequence which mimicked the spike protein (which allows the virus to enter our cells). This produced a harmless COVID particle which our cells then replicated, allowing our bodies to protect us from severe COVID infections when it encountered the real virus.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s discoveries years earlier were critical in making the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines possible. But these aren’t the only ways their work could be applied.'}}",99.16666666666667,1

In addition to the direct impact of the virus on people’s health, local lockdowns, recommendations to self-isolate, and disrupted travel and trade routes, have resulted in people losing their jobs, food shortages, and food prices increasing1,2. This perfect storm of reduced access to, and availability and affordability of, food has resulted in increased food insecurity (defined as existing when “all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”3, in both higher and lower-income countries4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nIn this paper, taking advantage of multiple waves of High Frequency Phone Surveys (HFPS) of households undertaken since the pandemic started, linked to ongoing panel micro studies, we undertake the first multi-country, multi-period analysis of the evolution of food insecurity in lower-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each of the governments of the 11 countries included in our analysis has implemented restrictions that include school closures, travel restrictions, and bans on public gatherings, to contain the spread of the virus10. While the stringency of the government responses were highest during March and April 2020 (in the early stages of the pandemic), some countries such as Djibouti and Mali started to relax their restrictions around July 2020. However, most of the sample countries continued to impose at least some restrictions until the end of 2020. With the rise of COVID-19 cases in the beginning of 2021 (Figure 1 in the Appendix), a number of countries re-imposed restrictions (Fig. 1). Countries have also implemented policies aimed at reducing the negative impacts of the pandemic and the restrictive policies, including emergency investments in healthcare facilities, and new forms of social welfare provision. We particularly focus on the policy interventions undertaken by governments to try to reduce the impact of the pandemic on food insecurity, including the use of food and cash safety nets.\n\nSocial safety nets have long been implemented by governments to protect poor and vulnerable people and improve socioeconomic conditions, and have been highlighted as being particularly important for vulnerable populations affected by negative shocks7,11,12. Government-funded safety nets are common across sub-Saharan Africa, indeed they can be found in every African country13. The explicit link between safety nets and food security, whether in higher or lower-income countries, is well documented in the literature14. Though there is a multitude of different safety nets, two common safety nets employed across many countries are cash transfer programmes and food-based programmes that can variously include providing food, food stamps, food vouchers, and food for work programmes13.\n\nA key debate in the literature, and among policy circles, is the extent to which cash or food assistance has most impact in reducing food insecurity15. Naturally, public nutrition programmes and food safety nets more broadly are designed to directly reduce food insecurity. Yet from a utility-maximising perspective, cash transfers tend to be considered to be more economically efficient because, at the margin, they do not distort consumption and production choices16,17,18. Further, cash transfers are often cheaper administratively18. There are also non-economic reasons for preferring cash to food transfers, such as that they are less “paternalistic”15,19.\n\nDespite theoretical and non-economic rationales for preferring cash to food transfers, there is a considerable body of empirical evidence that, in higher-income countries, in-kind transfers such as food stamps improve household food consumption more than cash transfers15. In lower-income countries, increasingly researchers are using randomised controlled trials, experiments, and regression analysis, to explore empirically whether cash or in-kind transfers are most effective at reducing food insecurity. As such, contextual evidence takes precedence over theoretical underpinnings.\n\nOur empirical findings suggest that safety nets in the form of cash assistance are more likely to reduce the chances of food insecurity among households over time. However, food assistance fails to significantly reduce the probability of food insecurity. Further, households with female and/or relatively less-educated heads, and those that are poorer or experiencing a pandemic-induced loss of income, have a higher chance of suffering food insecurity. We also show that households that were unable to rely on their savings and had to borrow to make ends meet were also more likely to suffer from food insecurity during the pandemic. As such, our paper shows the importance of understanding the socioeconomic underpinnings of COVID-19 impacts. Furthermore, heterogeneities in findings across countries reveal the need for evidence-based policies tailored to local contexts.\n\nData\n\nIn collaboration with international agencies including the European Commission, World Bank, and USAID, High Frequency Phone Surveys (HFPS) to investigate the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic have been conducted in a number of countries (https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/hfps). Many of these surveys are linked to ongoing household surveys and aim to collect information on loss of employment and income, health and wellbeing, impact on education of children, food (in)security, coping strategies adopted, and safety net disbursements. Summaries of these datasets, that we use in this study, are provided in Table 1.\n\nWe use these high-Frequency Phone Survey data on COVID-19 to track the impacts of the pandemic within and across countries. We present and analyse data from eleven countries. Specifically, we look at the following four indicators of household food insecurity from the survey questionnaire:\n\n1.\n\nHave you or any other adult in your household had to skip a meal in the last 30 days?\n\n2.\n\nDid the household go without eating for a whole day in the last 30 days?\n\n3.\n\nDid you or any other adult in your household run out of food in the last 30 days?\n\n4.\n\nWere you or any other member in your household hungry but did not eat in the last 30 days?\n\nAlthough there is considerable consistency across countries with respect to the indicators of food insecurity, coverage does vary from country to country. Whereas, for example, Malawi and Nigeria, at the time of writing, had each conducted seven waves, Armenia had only conducted one. Further, within these waves, some countries have consistently asked all four dimensions of food insecurity, whereas others have either only asked a subset, or have not asked the same questions consistently across waves.\n\nEstimation strategy\n\nWe use a fixed-effects linear probability model (Equation 1) to investigate the socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity during the pandemic for each country using household-level data over multiple waves for each of the food insecurity questions:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} y_{it} = \\delta X_{it} + \\phi Z_{it} + \\theta C_{it} + \\alpha _{i} + \\gamma _{t} + \\epsilon _{it} \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \\( y_{it}\\) is a binary outcome for household i in wave t in response to a specific food insecurity related question. \\(\\delta X_{it}\\) is a vector of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as education and gender, loss of household income compared to pre-pandemic levels/poverty status of households in the case of Chad, Djibouti, and Mali (income data are not available for these countries). In terms of safety nets, we control for whether a household has received cash or food benefits and, where this breakdown is unavailable, we control for whether a household has benefited from any safety net (\\(\\phi Z_{it}\\) is a vector of safety nets). To investigate whether the impact of safety nets on the probability of households suffering from food insecurity varies over time, interaction terms between the safety net variables and wave dummies are included. Because affordability of food is likely to be a strong determinant of food security, we include an additional dummy variable indicating whether the prices of major food items increased during the pandemic. We include two interaction terms; (1) increase in price and loss in income, and (2) increase in price and poverty status, to investigate whether increases in prices of major food items have a differential impact on food insecurity. \\(\\theta C_{it}\\) is a vector controlling for coping strategies that households have adopted during the pandemic: reliance on savings; and borrowing from friends, family, non-government organisations. Finally, we include sub-national and wave fixed-effects to control for unobserved heterogeneities (such as seasonality) across space and time. We use the sampling weights reported in the surveys.\n\nGovernment restrictions and consequent disruptions\n\nThe Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) reports stringency of governments’ policies and interventions to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Such measures might variously include school closures, travel restrictions, bans on public gatherings, emergency investments in healthcare facilities, new forms of social welfare provision, contact tracing and other interventions, and augmentation of health systems10. The index of stringency of these measures during the time period that the surveys in this paper were conducted is presented in Fig. 1. A clear pattern emerges. All 11 countries included in this paper rapidly transitioned from no restrictions at the start of 2020 to very high levels of restrictions by April 2020. Though stringency measures started to be relaxed from May 2020, most of the countries continued to impose considerable restrictions throughout the time period in consideration. Government stringency measures likely affected food security through a number of different channels, including loss of income where household members could not go to work20; and increasing food prices due to disruption of supply chains21, both of which we control for in our econometric analysis. The OxCGRT index is only available at the country-level, and not at the sub-national level. However, we control for sub-national heterogeneity in government restrictions by including regional fixed-effects and the changes in the stringency measures through the wave fixed-effects.\n\nFood insecurity and safety nets during the pandemic\n\nThe data from the multiple waves demonstrate how food insecurity has evolved during the pandemic. We present key descriptive statistics for each of the countries (Fig. 2). Some countries with multiple waves of data reveal clear trends across time. For example, in Nigeria and Uganda, across multiple dimensions, food security appears to be improving over time. In contrast, in Malawi, South Africa, and Chad, there is no clear pattern of improvement. These national level data hide sub-national trends, the richness of which are revealed in the country maps (Figures 3–10 in the Appendix).\n\nWhilst most countries report whether assistance is cash or food, two, Kenya and Armenia, only report government assistance in general terms, and some countries report three different categories of assistance. These discrepancies not withstanding, the data show that the extent and nature of the government safety nets varies considerably across countries (Fig. 3). Some countries, such as Ethiopia, have provided the majority of their population with either cash or food assistance. In other countries, such as Malawi, few households have received any type of government assistance. It should be noted that Chad and Mali have relatively low coverage of safety nets, this may be a government failure or it may be the case that coverage of safety nets is not being tracked. In the next section we undertake a series of econometric analyses to determine the extent to which these safety nets, in addition to other key variables, may have influenced how food insecurity has evolved during the pandemic.\n\nDeterminants of food insecurity\n\nThe econometric results are consistent across the four indicators of food insecurity (panels (a)–(d) in Fig. 4 and Tables 2, 3, 4, 5). Our results show that female-led households generally have a higher chance of food insecurity compared to male-led households. This effect is particularly pronounced in Malawi (for example, skipping a meal: 0.284, 95% CI 0.270, 0.299; going hungry: 0.541, 95% CI 0.516, 0.569). However, there are two exceptions: In Cambodia, having a female head reduces the probabilities of households going without eating for a whole day (panel (b); Fig. 4) and going hungry (panel (d); Fig. 4); and Chad, running out of food (panel (c); Fig. 4) and going hungry (panel (d); Fig. 4). The findings also suggest that households with relatively higher educated heads have a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity, suggesting that education continues to play an important role even during a pandemic. The influence of education varies considerably, with the highest benefits with respect to reducing the chances of being “hungry but did not eat” in Djibouti (− 0.232, 95% CI − 0.221, − 0.244), Ethiopia (− 0.156, 95% CI − 0.148, − 0.164), and Nigeria (− 0.156, 95% CI − 0.149, − 0.164); and the lowest in Malawi (− 0.006, 95% CI − 0.005, − 0.007).\n\nFood security is heavily influenced by a household’s ability to afford food. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the households experienced a loss in income, while prices of major food items have increased due to supply side constraints1,2. Our findings show that both these changes have increased households’ probability of suffering from food insecurity. The income effect is particularly strong in Cambodia (highest increase for the probability of “going without eating for a whole day”: 0.589, 95% CI 0.561, 0.619), Malawi (highest increase for the probability of “skipping a meal”: 0.274, 95% CI 0.260, 0.289), and Uganda (highest increase for the probability of “going without eating for a whole day”: 0.356, 95% CI 0.339, 0.374). For Chad, Djibouti, and Mali, we have poverty status of households rather than income information. For this group of countries, poverty status has the highest impact on the chances of being “hungry but did not eat” in Mali (0.382, 95% CI 0.364, 0.402), and the lowest in Malawi (0.135, 95% CI 0.129, 0.142). As would be expected, relatively poorer households have higher chances of suffering from food insecurity.\n\nAccording to our results, increases in prices of major food items have significantly affected food security among households across all 11 countries. Households in Ethiopia were particularly affected with respect to increased chance of “going hungry but did not eat” (0.327, 95% CI 0.311, 0.344); and those in Malawi with respect to increased chance of “running out food” (0.424, 95% CI 0.404, 0.444). Both interaction terms, loss of income and price increase dummy, and poverty status and price increase dummy, suggest that households who suffered income loss and relatively poorer households experienced relatively higher increases in the probability of food insecurity due to increases in prices of major food items (the highest effect is found in Mali in terms of increasing the chances of “going hungry but did not eat”: 0.447, 95% CI 0.426, 0.470). Though expected, these findings provide empirical evidence that increases in the prices of food items have a disproportionately higher impact on poorer households.\n\nIn terms of coping strategies, our findings show that households that were able to draw down on savings during the pandemic had a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity. Savings were more effective in reducing the probability of “skipping a meal” in Mali (− 0.327, 95% CI − 0.310, − 0.343), even controlling for poverty status of the households, than in other countries. In contrast, households that had to borrow (whether from friends or family or other sources) had a higher chance of experiencing food insecurity. These findings have implications for inequality and distributional impacts of the pandemic, as relatively higher income households are likely to have sufficient savings while poorer households are are likely have to borrow to make ends meet.\n\nDifferential impacts of safety nets\n\nOur findings indicate that cash transfers have been more effective than food transfers in reducing the probability of food insecurity during the pandemic (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8). The interaction terms between the safety net dummy variables and wave dummies further suggest that the efficacy of cash transfers improved during the pandemic. For households who received food as a safety net, however, though their probability of suffering from food insecurity also declined, across all countries with relevant data, it remained positive. For Kenya, where we do not have separate information on whether assistance is in the form of cash or food transfers, the results suggest that while safety nets were ineffective in the first wave, they did reduce the probability of food insecurity among household in the second and the third waves (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8 and Tables 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nThe lower-income countries addressed in this paper have been affected by, and responded to, the COVID-19 pandemic in different and varied ways. However, a number of common patterns emerge from the data that enable us to make several important contributions to the literature addressing food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and food insecurity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) more broadly. First, we have conducted the first multi-country, multi-time period analysis of the key factors influencing food insecurity during the pandemic. Across 11 countries and up to seven waves of data, we show how a combination of the direct health impacts of the pandemic and government responses restricting movement and trade have resulted in food insecurity that government safety nets have not fully mitigated. Our econometric analysis identifies key socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity during the pandemic. Importantly, we quantify these effects and demonstrate heterogeneity across countries and across food insecurity indicators, highlighting the importance of understanding local contexts. Specifically, households that are female-headed, less-educated, poor or experiencing a pandemic-induced loss of income, or without access to savings are more likely to suffer from food insecurity. These findings are consistent with much of the literature on the socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity22; and with23 who highlight key socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 related mortality. Because the educational background of parents influences their children’s educational, earnings, and wage outcomes24,25, our results further suggest that public investment and policies to improve education are likely to reduce inter-generational inequalities with respect food insecurity during any future crises, including possible future pandemics.\n\nSecond, we also show the differentiated impacts of household coping strategies—specifically savings versus borrowing. Our findings show that households that were able to rely on savings had a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity during the pandemic compared to the households that had to borrow, even controlling for poverty or loss of income. This finding is consistent with the literature that suggests that encouraging lower-income households to save will improve food security for the poor, not just in the context of the pandemic, and can build resilience to shocks and mitigate the more severe negative impacts of those shocks26,27,28. Third, our analysis confirms that the observed increases in the prices of major food items have increased the chances of food insecurity across countries, particularly for relatively poorer households and those that have suffered a loss in income.\n\nFinally, and importantly, our differentiated analysis of the efficacy of safety nets over time and across multiple countries demonstrates definitively that during this pandemic, cash assistance has reduced the chances of households suffering from food insecurity over time, whereas food assistance has failed to significantly reduce the probability of food insecurity during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, cash and food assistance have both been shown more broadly to improve food security across various dimensions. However, we recognise that there are other elements of food security, such as nutritional aspects and diet diversity, that we do not address, and that may not be influenced by cash transfers29. Many countries (such as Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, and South Africa) extended cash support using pre-pandemic information on vulnerability based on poverty status during the pandemic30. Our results support governments designing more targeted policies that take into account local contexts and location specific socioeconomic drivers of food insecurity; and targeting of particularly vulnerable groups including those who may be considered newly vulnerable due to shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, a number of countries have expanded cash transfers in a more targeted way, such as to the elderly (Cabo Verde, Mauritania), the disabled (Mauritania and Tunisia), and female-headed households (Mauritania). Further, countries including Madagascar and Sudan provided food assistance specifically to those who relied on daily earning who are particularly affected by government lockdown measures31. Combining these country specific targeted initiatives with our paper’s empirical findings offers guidance for governments as to how to ensure more effective food security outcomes from limited budgets.\n\nOur paper, one of the most comprehensive pieces of research to address food insecurity quantitatively across multiple countries and timescales, has revealed important empirical regularities of relevance to those responsible for improving food and nutrition status in households across lower-income countries. Our research supports the need for appropriately targeted safety nets, designed with an understanding of the specific country and household characteristics, and a broad understanding of food security that takes into account the importance of quality and nutritional content, in addition to quantity.\n\nWe recognise that though the data sets we use for our analysis are nationally representative, they are not directly comparable across countries and time, for example, in terms of the number of waves conducted, nor do they control for any potential seasonality effects. That said, we do control for the wave fixed-effects, and so do pick up seasonality aspects through the time fixed-effects. Furthermore, we do not run a pooled regression, instead the econometric analysis is conducted separately for each country, and therefore the risk of seasonality affecting our results is minimal.\n\nThese important debates over how to best reduce food insecurity tend to flare up during crises, such as pandemics, but are increasingly relevant more broadly given the persistence of food insecurity across LMICs and growing evidence that climate change is resulting in an increase in the number and proportion of under-nourished people across the globe32. As evidence increases that climate change is directly harming food security, government policies will be central to how countries adapt to the realities of climate change, particularly in terms of the likely increases in frequency and severity of shocks, on top of the slow-burn impact of increasing temperatures on crop yields.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-023-17104-6', 'Headline': 'A systematic review of the direct and indirect COVID-19’s impact on ...', 'Snippet': 'The summarised objective of all reviewed studies was to determine COVID-19’s burden on food security and associated dimension/s using the pre and post-COVID-19 food security analysis (Table 1).Four studies [25, 32,33,34] assessed the food security levels of households, three [16, 18, 36] identified the effect of the pandemic on the food security of individuals, while two studies [30, 31 ...', 'Full_text': 'Food security is defined as having healthy, nutritious, and physically and economically accessible food available to people in a defined geographic location and which satisfies the individuals’ dietary needs [1]. COVID-19, a communicable disease caused by the viral pathogen SARS-COV-2, continues to have multi-dimensional impacts all over the world [2,3,4]. Since its nominal emergence (31 December 2019), the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the food security of people across the world [5,6,7,8,9]. Specifically, the pandemic has impacting the food security of individuals and communities both directly and indirectly by overwhelming the agricultural productivity, exacerbating the energy poverty [10], and diminishing personal health and financial stability [11,12,13]. Prior to COVID-19, approximately 820 million individuals faced hunger each day globally, with over two billion individuals experiencing micronutrient deficiencies. These dietary issues in turn lead to increased risk of mortality and morbidities [14, 15]. COVID-19’s emergence resulted in disruptions to the production, processing, transporting, and marketing of food [15], which has caused flow-on impacts to food security. For example, fresh food products, including meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables, all recorded extensive price increases due to obstructions in transport channels [16]. A joint statement released in 2020 by the World Health Organization, (WHO) amongst others [14], reported that 3.3 billion global workers were identified as being at risk of losing their livelihood due to COVID-19. COVID-19 had exacerbated the already existing malnutrition in children. Further, 149 million children were estimated to have growth abnormalities, such as stunted (reduced in their growth performance), globally due to COVID-19 and other confounding factors, including natural disasters like drought, desert locust emergence, war and displacement [17]. The food security issues that arose due to COVID-19 were felt globally [18, 19], however, the level of crisis was more significant in lower-income countries [15] than in middle- and high-income countries.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) [1], there are four food security dimensions: availability; accessibility; usability; and sustainability/stability. Food availability is defined as the presence of adequate amount of food that satisfies the demand of the general population within a specified territory [20], while accessibility is the retrievability of food without excessive physical and/or economic barriers [21]. Usability of food refers to the nutritional quality of food and focuses on whether the accessible and available food is balanced, healthy, and nutritious [21]. This available and accessible food should then be able to satisfy the dietary and nutritional demands of the individual, households, community and/or the general population [20,21,22]. This food should be sustainable/stable by being available, accessible, and useful for a prolonged time [15, 20, 21]. All the four dimensions of food security are interdependent to each other and the effects of a certain factor that impacts one dimension can directly or indirectly overwhelm another [1]. As such, it is not appropriate to talk about food security using only one food security dimension. For instance, it is meaningless to discuss food accessibility, stability, and usability if food is not available and it is not rational to talk about food usability if food is not accessible.\n\nA recent article has identified the burden of COVID-19 pandemic on all the four dimensions [23], while another examined some of the food security dimensions [24]. Interestingly, findings from Iran showed that the emergence of COVID-19 had short term positive impact on food security of households and individuals [25]. Studies on the impact of COVID-19 were conducted in different geographic locations of the world, but the findings are currently inconsistent and sometimes contradictory. As a result, a compiled summary of all the available information, and which is informative for policy makers, food input suppliers, aid agencies and governmental and non-governmental bodies, is considered an appropriate research goal. In addition, identifying whether (and which) different food security dimensions have been impacted to greater or lesser extents during COVID-19 may assist local, regional and national government bodies in mitigating any emerging food insecurity issues.\n\nTo achieve these outcomes, a systematic review was conducted of all studies regarding COVID-19’s impact on food security. This paper examines the extent to which food security was directly and indirectly compromised by COVID-19, and how food security actors recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic induced food insecurity trauma. The application of findings of this systematic review are not necessarily restricted explicitly to COVID-19 as they may also have potential significance in early preparedness of the inevitable future pandemics. The purpose of this article was to summarise the food security impact of COVID-19 and pointing out the critically impacted dimension/s of food security. The specific questions that guided this systematic review were:\n\n1.\n\nHow much was food security directly and indirectly affected by COVID-19?\n\n2.\n\nWhich, if any, dimensions of food security were significantly compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nMethodology\n\nThis systematic review was undertaken in line with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines [26] and checklist [additional file 1]. In addition, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) systematic review checklist was used as a second point of reference to guide the process. Prior to the systematic review commencing, a protocol was prepared and registered in ROSPERO database with registration number CRD42022325475 and it was published online [27]. As indicated in the following sub-headings, each aspect of the PRISMA checklist was addressed sequentially.\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nPrimary research articles conducted on COVID-19’s impact on food security were the focus of the systematic review. However, so as to allow for comparative analysis of the burden of COVID-19, potential articles had to specifically focus on at least one of the four defined dimensions (food availability, accessibility, usability and stability) both prior to and/or following the emergence of COVID-19. No restrictions were placed on study design, with any qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method studies considered. Other types of literature (grey literature, review articles, protocols, reports, letters to editors and unpublished studies) were excluded from review. The reasons for excluding information sources other than primary research articles were to ensure the goal of identifying information from the primary source, and which were supported with data and followed expected research standards and procedures.\n\nIt is expected that primary research articles published in different languages on the topic of interest might be available in online information sources (databases), but only studies written in English were included. The timeframe for publication was from the approximate time of emergence of COVID-19 (31 December 2019) through to the end of this systematic review’s literature search (15 May 2022) were included.\n\nInformation sources, search strategy, and selection process\n\nFour databases (Web of Science; Scopus; PubMed; and Google Scholar) were used as the literature sources. The data from these four databases was identified from the nominal date for COVID-19 pandemic emergence (31/12/2019) through to 15/05/2022. All reference lists from the studies identified through the initial database searches were then explicitly assessed to avoid missing any relevant data source.\n\nA combination of search terms was used. The same terms were used for three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science), and search strings were applied according to the relevant database. As explained in the protocol [27], the search terms used for Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed were “Impact” OR “Effect” OR “Burden” AND “COVID 19”) OR “COVID-19 pandemic” OR “SARS COV 2” OR “Coronavirus disease 2019” OR “Coronavirus diseases 19” OR “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2”) AND “Food Security” OR “Food Insecurity” OR “Food Security dimension”. The publication date (31/12/2019—15/05/2022), the publication language (English), and the article type (primary research articles) were used as a filtering mechanism during the searching process. For identifying literature from Google Scholar, the short title of this systematic review (the COVID-19’s impact on food security, availability, accessibility, usability and stability) was used, and any potentially relevant articles that were not identified from other databases were included. Details of the search strategy for each database is described as follows.\n\nScopus: ( ALL ( impact) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( effect) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( burden) AND ALL ( covid 19) OR ALL ( covid-19 AND pandemic) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( sars AND cov 2) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( coronavirus AND disease 2019) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( coronavirus AND diseases 19) OR ABS ( severe AND acute AND respiratory AND syndrome AND coronavirus-2) AND ALL ( food AND security) OR ALL ( food AND insecurity) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( food AND security AND dimension)) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE, ""ar"")) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( PUBSTAGE, ""final"")) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( LANGUAGE, ""English"")).\n\nPubMed: (((((((((((Impact[Title/Abstract]) OR (Effect[Title])) OR (Burden[Title])) AND (COVID 19[Title/Abstract])) OR (COVID-19 Pandemic[Title/Abstract])) OR (SARS COV 2[Title/Abstract])) OR (Coronavirus disease 2019[Title/Abstract])) OR (Coronavirus diseases 19[Title/Abstract])) OR (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2[Title/Abstract])) AND (Food Security[Title/Abstract])) OR (Food Insecurity[Title/Abstract])) OR (Food Security dimension[Title/Abstract]).\n\nWeb of Science: Impact (All Fields) OR Effect (Abstract) OR Burden (Abstract) AND COVID 19 (All Fields) OR COVID-19 pandemic (All Fields) OR SARS COV 2 (Title) OR Coronavirus disease 2019 (All Fields) OR Coronavirus disease 19 (All Fields) OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (Abstract) AND Food Security (All Fields) OR Food Insecurity (All Fields) OR Food Security dimension (Abstract) and 2020 or 2021 or 2022 (Publication Years) and Article (Document Types) and English (Languages).\n\nGoogle scholar: COVID-19, Food Security, Impact, OR COVID-19, OR Pandemic, OR Food OR security, OR availability, OR accessibility, OR usability, OR stability.\n\nThe first author conducted the primary screening, and the same process was repeated by the other team members to ensure the validity and reliability of selection processes. Identification of potentially eligible studies was conducted initially through title and abstract screening, prior to a full text review occurring. A pre-determined process for resolving any disagreements was established, however ultimately there were no disagreements in the selection process among the review authors.\n\nData items and collection process\n\nStudies selected from the four databases were imported to EndNote X9. Literature searches were undertaken on 01 May 2022 for the first time and repeated 2 weeks later for the second time. The identified articles were de-duplicated using EndNote X9’s unique identifier function. Any redundant studies missed by the EndNote unique identifier were manually de-duplicated. The studies were considered regardless of the studies’ statistical analysis, geographic coverage, and study participants (individual, household, community or country). All COVID-19 related factors that exacerbated the food insecurity of individuals/households, such as COVID-19 prevention restrictions, agricultural production interruptions, job losses, import–export bans, and mortality of productive workforces, were synthesised into the final results.\n\nStudy risk of bias assessment\n\nThe Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used for assessing the risk of biases. The eight items of the JBI checklist are designed for assessing the risk of biases in reviewing primary studies with Yes, No, Unclear or Not Applicable answers. The items of the checklist are: 1) the inclusion and exclusion criteria of samples; 2) study subjects and settings; 3) exposure measurement validity and reliability; 4) objective and standard criteria of condition measurement; 5) identification of confounding factors; 6) strategies to deal with confounding factors; 7) validity and reliability of outcome measures; and 8) the use of appropriate statistical analysis in included studies.\n\nBased on the JBI critical appraisal checklist, each included study was independently appraised by a second author and no disagreement were raised among team members.\n\nEffect measures and synthesis methods\n\nCOVID-19-related food production or supply chain restrictions was considered as impacts on food availability. Food security reductions due to physical or economic constraints during COVID-19 were classified as food inaccessibility. The food quality and diversity reduction during the pandemic was interpreted as the impact of COVID-19 on food usability. Short-term food items availability that cannot be sustained due to the direct (effect on the food supply chain) and indirect (health and economic burdens) impacts were deemed to be food stability issues. Food insecurity increases during COVID-19 as compared with pre-pandemic food insecurity were expressed in the form of percentages. Overall, one or more food security dimension/s that was/were repeatedly reported by the majority of the included studies was identified as significantly altered dimension by COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSynthesis of this systematic review was focused on investigating COVID-19’s impact on food security and/or its four dimensions (availability, accessibility, usability and stability). Any included studies that failed to consider relevant confounding food insecurity drivers were critically appraised in the discussion and risk of bias assessment sections of this systematic review.\n\nReporting bias and certainty assessments\n\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) tool was used for assessing reporting biases in the studies. As recommended by Berkman et al. [28], the authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the papers using the AHRQ checklists. Based on the checklists, the studies with a high probability of reporting bias were categorised as “suspected” and the studies with a low probability of bias were noted as “undetected.” The certainties of evidence were assessed using the GRADE tool. The alignment of findings, the consistency of evidence, the level of suspected publication biases, the limitations of reviewed studies, and the availability of target outcomes in the reviewed studies were considered as factors for certainty.\n\nStudy selection\n\nOf the initial sample of 2,057 studies identified through the first search, 1,220 were found through database searching and the remaining 837 were from other sources, such as the aforementioned review of reference lists (Fig. 1). Of the 1220 papers found through database searches, 27 were identified as eligible for review, but 20 were removed due to the lack of pre-COVID-19 food security information. Fourteen potentially eligible studies were identified from other sources; 11 of these were removed because they were duplicates of studies already identified. Overall, this resulted in seven studies from the database search and three studies from other sources being included in the final sample of ten papers (Fig. 1). The study by Pradeilles et al. [29] in Peru was initially considered eligible to be included for review, but was removed due to a lack of pre-COVID-19 data for the food insecurity experience scale (FIES) indicator.\n\nCharacteristics of the reviewed studies\n\nTwo papers were published in 2020, seven in 2021, and one in 2022 (Table 1). Three studies [18, 30, 31] were conducted in the United States of America and the remaining studies included countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, Uganda, Kenya, Chile, Mexico, Lebanon, and Iran (Table 1). Only one study [16] covered the food insecurity prevalence of two countries (Kenya & Uganda), with the others covering either a single county or a province [25, 32] in a single country, or populations [30, 31] in the same country.\n\nThe summarised objective of all reviewed studies was to determine COVID-19’s burden on food security and associated dimension/s using the pre and post-COVID-19 food security analysis (Table 1). Four studies [25, 32,33,34] assessed the food security levels of households, three [16, 18, 36] identified the effect of the pandemic on the food security of individuals, while two studies [30, 31] investigated food insecurity levels in college students before and at the time of the pandemic in the United States of America. The remaining study [35] assessed food security of mothers before and after the pandemic in Bangladesh. The majority (8 out of 10) of the studies used a cross-sectional study design (Table 1) and the remaining studies used interrupted time series [35], and predictive model [36] designs. As indicated by Gaitán-Rossi et al. [33], food security of households with children was reduced. Contrary to the majority (9 out of 10) of the studies, the research conducted in Iran’s Tehran province [25] reported that the emergence of COVID-19 resulted in improved food security among households.\n\nRisk of bias in studies\n\nBased on the JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies, six studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias in all 8 items of the checklist while 4 studies [25, 32, 35, 36] were found to have unclear risk of bias in four items (Q1, Q3, Q4, and Q6) of the checklist (Table 2). Eight of the included studies used cross-sectional study design and the remaining two studies [35 and 36] had used predictive model and interrupted time series study designs. The JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies was designed for analytical cross-sectional studies and it was challenging to find a specific and appropriate risk of bias assessment tool for the two studies that used a predictive model [36] and interrupted time series [35]. Since the main difference of these study designs from cross-sectional methodologies is time-frame and ways of measurement, the JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies was considered still potentially suitable for predictive model and interrupted time series designs, and was therefore used.\n\nThe compromised food security dimension and its associated factors\n\nA majority (9 out of 10) of the studies used validated food security indicators, while one [36] of the studies estimated the food insecurity prevalence using a predictive model from previous food insecurity trends. The most compromised food security dimension identified across nine studies was the accessibility of food, with all the studies reporting that economic crisis due to COVID-19 was the main cause of food inaccessibility (Table 3). Two studies [16, 32] confirmed that the usability (quality) of food was reduced during COVID-19 and that food diversity during COVID-19 was less than the food diversity before the emergence of the pandemic. The study from Iran [25] reported that the food diversity (usability/quality) of households had actually increased following COVID-19 and the food security was improved. This was in contrast to the study conducted in Indonesia [32] which indicated that food access, availability, and usability were all compromised by COVID-19.\n\nTwo studies [30, 31] examined food security using prior and following the pandemic emergence food security levels of individuals. Both papers identified the negative impact of COVID-19 on food security, with food security status reduced during the pandemic as compared with the pre-pandemic food security status (Table 4). The remaining eight studies explored COVID-19 related food security using pre- and post-COVID-19 emergence food insecurity prevalence.\n\nRisk of reporting bias in reviewed studies\n\nEach reviewed study was assessed using the AHRQ bias assessment criteria. Berkman et al. [28] noted that the reporting of bias assessment outcomes using this tool shall be either “suspected” or “undetected”. If the reviewer cannot identify any reporting bias from studies, it is recommended to say ‘undetected’ than to say ‘free from reporting biases’. Based on this tool (AHRQ), the reporting biases of the majority (9 out of 10) of the reviewed studies were assessed as “undetected” as indicated by the tick “√” symbol in Table 5. The study [36] that used a predictive model for estimating food insecurity was assessed as being “suspected” of bias, as the study was based on the food insecurity data 2–4 years before the occurrence of the pandemic and did not necessarily report on data indicative of the current situation immediately prior to and during the pandemic. Since there might be unidentified food insecurity variation during that longer time period, it was considered potentially problematic to compare the food insecurity during COVID-19 with the situation greater than 2 years prior to the pandemic’s emergence. As a result, the food insecurity report by Kharroubi et al. [36] was suspected of potential bias.\n\nCertainty of evidence\n\nBased on the GRADE Pro handbook the certainty of results was assessed in three modalities (low, very low, moderate, and high). Each study was judged based on the pre-set criteria (Table 6). The study that included pre and post-COVID-19 emergence food security data, identified impacted food security dimension/s, and used collected data instead of estimations was categorised as having a ‘high’ certainty of evidence. The evidence from the majority (9 out of 10) of the studies had high certainty of evidence. The remaining paper [36], which used retrospective data collected 2–4 years before the emergence of COVID-19, was categorised as having low certainty of evidence, particularly considering the influences and multifactored nature of food insecurity.\n\nConceptually, food security is a complex and multifaceted issue [37], with four separate dimensions (food access, availability, usability, and stability) and is influenced by biological, social, and economic factors. As a result of its complexity, it is difficult for all dimensions of food security to be covered with any single food security indicator and a combination of tools should be used to examine the impact of COVID-19’s on food security [37, 38]. The current systematic review was designed to assess the COVID-19 related crisis on food security and associated food dimensions. This was undertaken using a pre-and post-comparative analysis by considering the date of COVID-19 emergence as the reference point. The main findings from this systematic review are presented below.\n\nFood insecurity due to COVID-19\n\nNine of the included studies reported that COVID-19 negatively affected food security and reported reduced food security status [30, 31] or increased food insecurity prevalence [16, 18, 32,33,34,35,36]. These articles noted that food security reduction in the form of four food security modalities (high food security, marginal food security, low food security, or very low food security) [9, 16, 35, 39]. In contrast to the other papers, the study conducted in Iran [25] reported that COVID-19 had a positive impact by increasing the food security and dietary diversity of households. The authors of this study [25] justified that the food security and dietary diversity improvement during COVID-19 was due to free food supplements to vulnerable groups, extending e-marketing, delivering nutrition advice, and governmental and non-governmental donations to the people, during the pandemic.\n\nThe largest food insecurity increase (44%) due to COVID-19 was observed in Uganda followed by Kenya [16] with a 38% food insecurity prevalence difference pre-and post-pandemic. This food insecurity prevalence was considered to be largely due to the rural–urban marketing channel disturbance of fresh food products like fish, meat, and vegetables [16]. Except the study conducted in Iran [25], other studies indicated that food security was reduced during COVID-19, with reported figures of 17% in Indonesia [32], 11% in Mexico [33], 19% in Chile [34], 31% in Bangladesh [35], 12% in Lebanon [36], and 8.4% in the USA [18]. In two studies, food security was reduced by 15.7% [34] and 3.34% [30] due to COVID-19 in the United States of America. The economic crisis due to COVID-19, increased unemployment [39], food value chain disturbances [40, 41], marketing channel interruptions [42, 43], and food service provider (hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, and retailers) closures [44] were mentioned as the main constraints of food security during COVID-19. These findings would indicate that proactive planning to facilitate more immediate intervention measures by governmental and non-governmental organizations toward food security resilience are needed for future pandemics [25].\n\nThe compromised food security dimension\n\nThe majority (9 out of 10) of the included studies confirmed that the most affected food security dimension was food access, which is consistent with other research [9, 45] that identified food access as being substantially impacted. It is acknowledged that the included studies didn’t use equivalent methods that equally measure all four of the food security dimensions, and this may have led to some diversity in data. Nonetheless, there was a consistent theme across the majority of papers. It was argued that food inaccessibility was primarily due to the poor economic capacity of consumers. This is not surprising; however, it is worth highlighting that physical food inaccessibility was also considered a result of lockdowns which led to a reduction in food access [30,31,32,33].\n\nIn addition to food accessibility, the availability of food [32, 33], and usability/quality of food [16, 32] were reported as being compromised due to COVID-19. The effect of COVID-19 on food usability was considered to be compromised due to a reduction in food diversity. Specifically, one paper [32] identified that three food security dimensions (accessibility, availability, and usability) were affected due to the restrictions and measures applied for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Once food accessibility or availability is compromised, food stability/sustainability is impacted by default [24, 46]. Lockdown measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 were identified as the main factor for this reduction in food security [47], and this one aspect of food security impacted the entire food system chain [23].\n\nLimitation of the reviewed studies and the review process\n\nThe studies did not necessarily take into account any potential confounding factors, such as illnesses other than COVID-19 [48], natural disasters during COVID-19 (desert locusts in Kenya, Uganda, and Lebanon, and floods in Bangladesh) [49], and climate change at the time of the pandemic [50]. Such factors will also have contributed to the reduction of food security and can therefore obscure the real effect of COVID-19. It is also worth recognising that experience-based food security measures are usually subject to recall biases [51]. Since the included studies used cross-sectional study designs, it is not possible to establish trends of food insecurity developments and to prioritise potential interventions.\n\nDue to time constraints, only primary research articles were included, with brief reports, unpublished studies, reviews, and studies published in languages other than English excluded. This approach to study selection might have excluded relevant literature. This is important as the time delay from doing a study until results are presented in a journal may have meant that potentially relevant papers relating to a recent issue, such as COVID-19, had not yet had sufficient time to be published. Moreover, it is acknowledged that the initial selection system using title and abstract can also be prone to potentially missing relevant studies [52].\n\nThe food security of households and individuals was severely compromised due to COVID-19 emergence. The health, agriculture and socio-economic crises following the COVID-19 pandemic indirectly impacted food security as compared with the pre-pandemic situations. The food accessibility dimension of food security was mainly impacted due to the pandemic. Contrary to the pandemic’s negative impact, integrated food aid interventions by private sectors, and governmental and non-governmental organizations improved food security during COVID-19. Based on this conclusion, the following recommendations were forwarded.\n\nBalancing COVID-19 prevention and food security crises\n\nTo implement either localised or widespread COVID-19 restrictions, such as transport bans, lockdowns, food market chain restrictions, and quarantine, the benefits should outweigh any problems that arise. This is particularly relevant for disadvantaged groups, particularly in low-income countries, where circumstances characterised by ‘hand to mouth’ meant entire communities cannot easily cope with any new food security crises, such as those arising due to COVID-19 prevention measures [53]. Therefore, any COVID-19 prevention restrictions should consider these social groups and balance the positives of reduced COVID-19 transmission arising from such restrictions, against the detrimental impact associated with food security [54].\n\nDecisions that are unidirectionally focused (i.e. focusing on health crisis only) and implemented hastily without due consideration to all possibly factors, may have a catastrophic impact on food security. Unless these decisions are made in integrated manner (for instance in a ‘one health’ approach), emerging crises due to food insecurity might be as devasting as the personal health impact directly from COVID-19. Participating multi-disciplinary professionals, facilitating emergency food aid and SafetyNet programs, and prioritizing the pros and cons of COVID-19 prevention measures before implementation, should all be considered as potential strategies for balancing COVID-19’s prevention measures and arising food security crises.\n\nIntegrated food security interventions\n\nFood insecurity, arising either directly from the pandemic or indirectly due to restrictions applied for its prevention and control, should be mitigated by integrated interventions that are coordinated by governmental and non-governmental organisations, individuals, and institutions. Food security interventions can reduce mortality associated with food insecurity while balancing the need for COVID-19 prevention restrictions [55]. Although the data is limited, the food security crises during COVID-19 appear to be higher in low- and middle-income countries when compared to high-income countries. Therefore, along with the integrated COVID-19 prevention, collaborative food security intervention between countries is recommended as a proactive strategy to alleviate future problems associated with pandemics [56]. There was stepwise food insecurity increments in households with children [33]. Based on this food insecurity trend, it is recommended that food security actors (like food suppliers, aid and agricultural organizations) prioritise households with children. Households and individuals who were vulnerable for food security crises, including those with lower income, unemployed household member, female-leaded household, households with more children, and household members with lower educational level, are particularly highlighted for urgent intervention areas [34].\n\nSupporting food security resilience\n\nThis systematic review found that food security was severely affected by COVID-19. This compromised food security needs to be supported to recover, and communities that experience food insecurity should be proactively assisted to overcome both immediate and emerging crises. To achieve food security resilience, communities needed to be provided with the tools and resources to be more independent. Unless cooperative food insecurity resilience is applied, the vulnerable groups\' morbidity and mortality due to food insecurity will be exacerbated [57].\n\nFuture implications\n\nThere is currently a lack of comparative data examining food security pre and post-COVID-19 emergence, and a more nuanced understanding of these complex issues can only be achieved with a greater focus on these areas. Studies regarding the effect of post-pandemic restrictions on food security, determining the vulnerable groups for food insecurity, identifying the food security resilience methods during and after COVID-19, and investigating the merits and emerging problems arising from COVID-19 prevention measures are all recommended topics for consideration in prospective studies. Considering the limitations of included studies, it is also suggested that future research should consider and evaluate the multiple food security driving factors external to COVID-19 that might increase the food security crisis.\n\nRegistration and protocol\n\nThis systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the registrations number: CRD42022325475. Protocol for the review process was prepared and the review was conducted as per the pre-planned protocol. The protocol is published at PLOS ONE [27] and can be accessed online (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9362949/).\n\nAmendments of published protocol\n\nThe protocol of this systematic review [27] was published before the end of this article. In the protocol, the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool was proposed to be used as a risk of bias assessment tool. Since this tool is more appropriate for systematic reviews than primary studies, the risk of bias of this systematic review was assessed using JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.who.int/news/item/06-07-2022-un-report--global-hunger-numbers-rose-to-as-many-as-828-million-in-2021', 'Headline': 'UN Report: Global hunger numbers rose to as many as 828 million in 2021', 'Snippet': 'The number of people affected by hunger globally rose to as many as 828 million in 2021, an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (1), according to a United Nations report that provides fresh evidence that the world is moving further away from its goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030. The ...', 'Full_text': ""The number of people affected by hunger globally rose to as many as 828 million in 2021, an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (1), according to a United Nations report that provides fresh evidence that the world is moving further away from its goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030.\n\nThe 2022 edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report presents updates on the food security and nutrition situation around the world, including the latest estimates of the cost and affordability of a healthy diet. The report also looks at ways in which governments can repurpose their current support to agriculture to reduce the cost of healthy diets, mindful of the limited public resources available in many parts of the world.\n\nThe report was jointly published today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe numbers paint a grim picture:\n\nAs many as 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021 – 46 million people more from a year earlier and 150 million more from 2019.\n\nAfter remaining relatively unchanged since 2015, the proportion of people affected by hunger jumped in 2020 and continued to rise in 2021, to 9.8% of the world population. This compares with 8% in 2019 and 9.3% in 2020.\n\nAround 2.3 billion people in the world (29.3%) were moderately or severely food insecure in 2021 – 350 million more compared to before the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic. Nearly 924 million people (11.7% of the global population) faced food insecurity at severe levels, an increase of 207 million in two years.\n\nThe gender gap in food insecurity continued to rise in 2021 - 31.9% of women in the world were moderately or severely food insecure, compared to 27.6% of men – a gap of more than 4 percentage points, compared with 3 percentage points in 2020.\n\nAlmost 3.1 billion people could not afford a healthy diet in 2020, up 112 million from 2019, reflecting the effects of inflation in consumer food prices stemming from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in place to contain it.\n\nAn estimated 45 million children under the age of five were suffering from wasting, the deadliest form of malnutrition, which increases children’s risk of death by up to 12 times. Furthermore, 149 million children under the age of five had stunted growth and development due to a chronic lack of essential nutrients in their diets, while 39 million were overweight.\n\nProgress is being made on exclusive breastfeeding, with nearly 44% of infants under 6 months of age being exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2020. This is still short of the 50% target by 2030. Of great concern, 2 in 3 children are not fed the minimum diverse diet they need to grow and develop to their full potential.\n\nLooking forward, projections are that nearly 670 million people (8% of the world population) will still be facing hunger in 2030 – even if a global economic recovery is taken into consideration. This is a similar number to 2015, when the goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition by the end of this decade was launched under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nAs this report is being published, the ongoing war in Ukraine, involving two of the biggest global producers of staple cereals, oilseeds and fertilizer, is disrupting international supply chains and pushing up the prices of grain, fertilizer, energy, as well as ready-to-use therapeutic food for children with severe malnutrition. This comes as supply chains are already being adversely affected by increasingly frequent extreme climate events, especially in low-income countries, and has potentially sobering implications for global food security and nutrition.\n\n“This report repeatedly highlights the intensification of these major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition: conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks, combined with growing inequalities,” the heads of the five UN agencies (2) wrote in this year's Foreword. “The issue at stake is not whether adversities will continue to occur or not, but how we must take bolder action to build resilience against future shocks.”\n\nRepurposing agricultural policies\n\nThe report notes as striking that worldwide support for the food and agricultural sector averaged almost US$ 630 billion a year between 2013 and 2018. The lion's share of it goes to individual farmers, through trade and market policies and fiscal subsidies. However, not only is much of this support market-distorting, but it is not reaching many farmers, hurts the environment and does not promote the production of nutritious foods that make up a healthy diet. That's in part because subsidies often target the production of staple foods, dairy and other animal source foods, especially in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Rice, sugar and meats of various types are most incentivized food items worldwide, while fruits and vegetables are relatively less supported, particularly in some low-income countries.\n\nWith the threats of a global recession looming, and the implications this has on public revenues and expenditures, a way to support economic recovery involves the repurposing of food and agricultural support to target nutritious foods where per capita consumption does not yet match the recommended levels for healthy diets.\n\nThe evidence suggests that if governments repurpose the resources they are using to incentivize the production, supply and consumption of nutritious foods, they will contribute to making healthy diets less costly, more affordable and equitably for all.\n\nFinally, the report also points out that governments could do more to reduce trade barriers for nutritious foods, such as fruits, vegetables and pulses.\n\n(1) It is estimated that between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021. The estimate is presented as a range to reflect the added uncertainty in data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. The increases are measured with reference to the middle of the projected range (768 million).\n\n(2) For FAO - QU Dongyu, Director-General; for IFAD - Gilbert F. Houngbo, President; for UNICEF - Catherine Russell, Executive Director; for WFP - David Beasley, Executive Director; for WHO - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General.\n\nWhat they said\n\nFAO Director-General QU Dongyu: “Low-income countries, where agriculture is key to the economy, jobs and rural livelihoods, have little public resources to repurpose. FAO is committed to continue working together with these countries to explore opportunities for increasing the provision of public services for all actors across agrifood systems.”\n\nIFAD President Gilbert F. Houngbo: “These are depressing figures for humanity. We continue to move away from our goal of ending hunger by 2030. The ripple effects of the global food crisis will most likely worsen the outcome again next year. We need a more intense approach to end hunger and IFAD stands ready to do its part by scaling up its operations and impact. We look forward to having everyone's support.”\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell: “The unprecedented scale of the malnutrition crisis demands an unprecedented response. We must double our efforts to ensure that the most vulnerable children have access to nutritious, safe, and affordable diets -- and services for the early prevention, detection and treatment of malnutrition. With so many children’s lives and futures at stake, this is the time to step up our ambition for child nutrition – and we have no time to waste.”\n\nWFP Executive Director David Beasley: “There is a real danger these numbers will climb even higher in the months ahead. The global price spikes in food, fuel and fertilizers that we are seeing as a result of the crisis in Ukraine threaten to push countries around the world into famine. The result will be global destabilization, starvation, and mass migration on an unprecedented scale. We have to act today to avert this looming catastrophe.”\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “Every year, 11 million people die due to unhealthy diets. Rising food prices mean this will only get worse. WHO supports countries’ efforts to improve food systems through taxing unhealthy foods and subsidising healthy options, protecting children from harmful marketing, and ensuring clear nutrition labels. We must work together to achieve the 2030 global nutrition targets, to fight hunger and malnutrition, and to ensure that food is a source of health for all.”\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nAcute food insecurity: food insecurity found in a specified area at a specific point in time and of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration. Has relevance in providing strategic guidance to actions that focus on short-term objectives to prevent, mitigate or decrease severe food insecurity.\n\nHunger: an uncomfortable or painful sensation caused by insufficient energy from diet. Food deprivation. In this report, the term hunger is synonymous with chronic undernourishment and is measured by the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU).\n\nMalnutrition: an abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive intake of macronutrients and/or micronutrients. Malnutrition includes undernutrition (child stunting and wasting, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies) as well as overweight and obesity.\n\nModerate food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which people face uncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been forced to reduce, at times during the year, the quality and/or quantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other resources. It refers to a lack of consistent access to food, which diminishes dietary quality and disrupts normal eating patterns. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.\n\nSevere food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which, at some time during the year, people have run out of food, experienced hunger and at the most extreme, gone without food for a day or more. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/scicheck-what-weve-learned-about-so-called-lockdowns-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/', 'Headline': ""What We've Learned About So-Called 'Lockdowns' and the COVID-19 ..."", 'Snippet': 'The authors examined seven studies on the impact of more severe restrictions, calculating from those studies that, compared with a policy of recommendations, “lockdowns in Europe and the United ...', 'Full_text': ""The working paper calculates mortality impact estimates for each of the seven studies aiming to show the effect of the average mandated restrictions in Europe and the United States early in the pandemic compared with a policy of only recommendations. The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

And like countless other migrants, they were forced to move home to the countryside to cut down on expenses.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that 97 million people across the globe fell into poverty due to the pandemic in 2020, living on less than $2 a day.\n\nThere has been little improvement since. “Globally, the increase in poverty that occurred in 2020 due to Covid still lingers, and the Covid-induced poor in 2021 continues to be 97 million people,” economists at the World Bank said in a blog post earlier this year. They noted, however, that overall poverty should go down this year.\n\n“We barely had enough to return home,” Dipali Roy said in an interview in Bengali from the family’s home, a corrugated metal shack in a village in northern Bangladesh.\n\nAs the couple looked for new ways to earn a living, they struggled to adjust. They tried to find a loan to start a small business, but at first no one was able or willing to help. Some local nonprofitorganizations asked for collateral, which they didn’t have.\n\nHoping to land a job in agriculture, Pradip Roy approached some farmers. But he was dismissed as a “Dhaka man,” who wouldn’t be able to cope in harsh weather conditions, recounted his wife.\n\nAbove all, “food was the biggest problem,” said20-year-old Dipali Roy, who was pregnant at the time and sometimes could only have one meal a day through a public rationing program. “I didn’t know what to do … We would just have to sit and wait when they would bring food.”\n\n2020 led to a historic setback in the fight against global poverty, with the number of the world’s poorest rising for the first time in over 20 years, according to the World Bank.\n\nCarolina Sánchez-Páramo, global director of poverty and equity at the World Bank, likened the pandemic to a natural disaster that would quickly spread beyond its epicenter in East Asia.\n\n“We knew the tsunami was coming,” she told CNN Business.\n\n“The question was not if this [economic shock] was going to reach the other developing regions, but when.”\n\nRising inequality\n\nEven as tens of millions of people were being pushed into destitution, the ultra-rich becamewealthier.Last year, billionaires enjoyed the highest boost to their share of wealth on record, according to the World Inequality Lab.\n\nAnd while it took just nine months for the world’s 1,000 richest people to reclaim their fortunes during the pandemic, it could be more than a decade before the least fortunate recover, according to Oxfam International’s annual inequality report, released in January.\n\nShameran Abed, executive director of BRAC International, a nonprofit that works to alleviate poverty across Asia and Africa, pointed to the widening wealth gap, saying that “the world’s three richest people” could likely wipe out ultra poverty on Earth.\n\n“It’s not their responsibility alone,” he added. “But I’m just saying that generally there’s enough resources [to tackle the problem].”\n\nRecently, the top 1% has been under pressure to pitch in on humanitarian issues.\n\nIn November, the director of the United Nations’ World Food Programme called on billionaires including the world’s two richest men, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, to “step up now, on a one-time basis.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Becky Anderson, David Beasley said that giving $6 billion, or about 2% of Musk’s net worth, could help solve world hunger.\n\n“[It’s] $6 billion to help 42 million people that are literally going to die if we don’t reach them. It’s not complicated,” he added.\n\nThe call-out got a direct response from Musk, who later said on Twitter that if the organization could lay out “exactly how” the funding would solve the issue, he would “sell Tesla stock right now and do it.”\n\nThe Tesla (TSLA) CEO did not publicly respond when the UN released a plan in November.\n\nWhat’s needed now\n\nAbed, who recently worked with members of parliament in the United Kingdom to declare an “emergency” on the issue, argues that “poverty is a policy choice.”\n\n“We have the know-how to pull large amounts of people out of poverty,” said the nonprofit leader, whose team helped the Roys with a loan that the couple said got them back on their feet.\n\n“There’s plenty of evidence of what works, what doesn’t work.”\n\nExperts say the first task is to concentrate on vaccinations.\n\n“We need to make sure that everybody has access to vaccines or some sort of treatment for the pandemic, because till you manage to control the health shock, it’s very hard to think about economic recovery right?” said Sánchez-Páramo. “That’s almost like a necessary condition for anything else to happen.”\n\nVaccine inequality has become a major issue as many of the world’s richest countries hoard shots, buying up enough doses to vaccinate their populations several times over and failing to deliver on their promises to share them with the developing world.\n\nAnd as governments continue to rebuild, theyshould also focus on reactivating economic activity that would generate employment, such as in the service sector, according to Sánchez-Páramo.\n\nOver the past two years, governments around the world have rolled out stimulus packages to help prop up their respective economies.\n\nSánchez-Páramo noted that while many have since come under “fiscal pressure” over how much they spent, it was important not to roll back safety net programs too quickly.\n\n“They [should] wait for employment to recover before they withdraw income support from some of these more vulnerable households,” she said.\n\n“Because if we consolidate and roll back the support too quickly, we may actually see a second wave of increases in poverty because the employment is not yet there.”\n\nGlimmers of hope\n\nBack in Bangladesh, the Roys are having better days.\n\nAfter securing a loan of 40,000 taka ($466), the couple purchased a van and a goat to support themselves, they said.\n\nPradip Roy now works as driver with his van, ferrying passengers for the equivalent of about $6 a day. He said the family has no plans to return to the city, and is now saving up to buy a cow and some agricultural land.\n\nWhile the two have technically climbed out of poverty, the hardships of the coronavirus crisis have made their mark.\n\nDipali Roy, who described the pangs of hunger while she was pregnant as “the most painful” time of her life, said “if I think back to, or remember those times, my heart bursts with tears.”\n\n“But now we are having very good days,” she added, saying that she had regained hope for the future, and dreams that their six-month-old son will go on to get a master’s degree.\n\nStill, they have a reminder for the international community: do not forget those still left behind.\n\n“There are a lot of people like us who fell to the bottom,” said Pradip Roy. “So if you stand beside them they can also rise back up like us, slowly.”\n\n— Esha Mitra in New Delhi and Ivana Kottasová in London contributed to this report.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC9335023', 'Headline': 'Effect of COVID-19 on food security, hunger, and food crisis', 'Snippet': 'This is while world hunger is increasing with the COVID-19 crisis.36.

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-did-it-robby-mook-michael-sussmann-donald-trump-russia-collusion-alfa-bank-11653084709', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton Did It - WSJ - The Wall Street Journal', 'Snippet': 'The Russia-Trump collusion narrative of 2016 and beyond was a dirty trick for the ages, and now we know it came from the top—candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.', 'Full_text': ''}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/15/politics/hillary-clinton-john-durham/index.html', 'Headline': 'Durham interviewed Hillary Clinton on alleged plan to tie Trump to ...', 'Snippet': 'Special counsel John Durham’s report released Monday details his investigation of a purported effort by Hillary Clinton ’s 2016 campaign to tie Donald Trump to Russia but which Durham concludes “did not, all things considered, amount to a provable criminal offense.”', 'Full_text': 'Special counsel John Durham’s report released Monday details his investigation of a purported effort by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign to tie Donald Trump to Russia but which Durham concludes “did not, all things considered, amount to a provable criminal offense.”\n\nDurham reveals in a footnote that he interviewed the former secretary of State in May 2022 as part of his investigation.\n\nThe special counsel was looking into whether any crimes occurred in the handling of an uncorroborated piece of US intelligence indicating Russia knew of a Clinton campaign plan to vilify her opponent, Trump, by tying him to the country.\n\nThe 2016 intelligence got the attention of then-CIA Director John Brennan, who briefed the Obama White House and referred the issue to the FBI. During the Trump administration, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe released some of Brennan’s notes about the intelligence used in his briefing of former President Barack Obama.\n\nRatcliffe publicly said that the intelligence community never corroborated the Russian claims of a “Clinton Plan” to frame Trump, and didn’t know whether it was fabricated.\n\nIn her interview with Durham’s investigators, Clinton expressed sympathy for Durham’s hunt. She calls it, “really sad,” adding, “I get it, you have to go down every rabbit hole.”\n\nBut Durham believes the uncorroborated intelligence should have at least made the FBI question whether it was being used by a political opponent to pursue allegations against the Trump campaign, the report shows.\n\nClinton called the intelligence that was consuming Durham’s time bogus, saying it “looked like Russian disinformation to me.”\n\nA spokesman for Clinton didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday.\n\nDurham concludes that it would be impossible to prosecute anyone for their handling of the intelligence.

While that did not lead to charges of criminal collaboration between Mr Trump\'s team and Russia, it could undermine Mr Trump\'s allegations that the Clinton team invented the Trump campaign\'s Russia connections out of whole cloth.\n\nA court victory may be unlikely, but Mr Trump can tout the lawsuit itself to his supporters as evidence that he is fighting back against his accusers.

Durham alleges Sussmann lied to the FBI about who his client was during a meeting where Sussmann shared information about possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nBut in a few extra sentences, Durham\'s filing mentions a second instance where Sussmann tried to raise concerns of a Trump-Russia connection, this time apparently to the CIA. That information came from one of Sussmann\'s clients, technology executive Rodney Joffe.\n\nDurham\'s filing noted that Joffe\'s company, Neustar, had an arrangement to provide security-related work on computer servers, including the White House\'s. But, according to the filing, Joffe used that access to mine Internet data to establish an inference and narrative tying then-candidate Trump to Russia.\n\nJoffe has not been charged with any crime.\n\nAll of this has now been spun by conservative media and former President Trump himself to say Sussmann and Joffe were Clinton operatives who were paid to illegally hack into and spy on the Trump campaign and Trump White House.\n\nFormer President Trump wrote: ""In a stronger period of time in our country, this crime would have been punishable by death.""\n\nIn a column this week, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charlie Savage of The New York Times wrote that the entire narrative appeared to be mostly wrong or old news, and its conclusions ""based on a misleading presentation of the facts or outright misinformation.""\n\nCharlie Savage joins me now.\n\nI wonder if you could help us understand just initially how we got to this point, how Durham\'s investigation has morphed into this sort of explosive story in conservative media.\n\nCharlie Savage, The New York Times:\n\nSo, back in the Trump administration, right after Robert Mueller, the Russian special counsel, finished his report, Donald Trump shifted — tried to shift the narrative to or escalated his attempt to shift the narrative to the idea that he was actually a victim of a deep state conspiracy.\n\nAnd his attorney general, Bill Barr, as you mentioned, appointed John Durham, then a U.S. attorney, to be what became another special counsel, a special counsel to investigate the investigation.\n\nAnd the whole idea and expectation then was he was going to prove Trump\'s narrative that there were high-level officials who — in the FBI and the CIA who had essentially framed him for collusion.\n\nBut we\'re almost three years in now, and he has yet to bring any charges against the high-level officials. He has developed two cases against outsiders, and one of them is this Sussmann case. Both of these are merely false statement cases. They\'re not charging a conspiracy.\n\nBut Mr. Durham has used court filings and indictments and so forth, related to these cases to put out large amounts of information that are not directly related to the charges. And this information is imbued with insinuations that there is some kind of vast anti-Trump conspiracy.\n\nHe just hasn\'t been able to prove it yet or charge it. It all goes back to Hillary Clinton, is the implication.\n\nCharlie Savage:\n\nThere\'s been this repeated cycle of huge alarmism stoked within right-wing pro-Trump outlets that I don\'t really consider doing the same kind of journalism that I\'m doing sending out the message with the blaring outrage, grievance-stroking headlines that now it\'s been proven they were spying on President Trump.\n\nAnd every time you look at it, it — there\'s less there than meets the eye. But if you don\'t cover it, then that allows the sort of Trump world and his allies to say, aha, you know, the media, they\'re in on it. They\'re covering it up. It\'s a conspiracy. They just won\'t tell the truth.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-16/us-special-counsel-ends-trump-russia-probe-fbi/102349794', 'Headline': 'FBI lacked evidence for alleged

and relied too heavily on tips provided by Mr Trump\'s political opponents to fuel the probe, US Special Counsel John Durham concluded in a report released on Monday.\n\nThe report marks the end of a four-year investigation launched in May 2019 when then-Attorney-General William Barr appointed Mr Durham, a veteran prosecutor, to probe potential missteps by the FBI when it launched its early stage Crossfire Hurricane inquiry into potential contacts between Mr Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nMr Durham said there were a series of missteps by the FBI and Justice Department as investigators undertook a politically explosive probe in the heat of the 2016 election into whether the Trump campaign was colluding with Russia to tip the outcome.\n\nBut the report fell far short of the former president\'s prediction he would uncover the ""crime of the century"".\n\nThat Crossfire Hurricane investigation would later be handed over to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who in March 2019 concluded there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump\'s 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nIn his new 306-page report, Mr Durham concluded that US intelligence and law enforcement did not possess any ""actual evidence"" of collusion between Mr Trump\'s campaign and Russia prior to launching Crossfire Hurricane.\n\nHe also accused the bureau of treating the 2016 Trump probe differently from other politically sensitive investigations, including several involving Mr Trump\'s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nFor instance, he said Ms Clinton and other officials received defensive briefings about being the possible targets of foreign interference, whereas Mr Trump received no such briefing before the FBI opened probes into four members of his campaign.\n\n""Senior FBI personnel displayed a serious lack of analytical rigour towards the information that they received, especially information from politically affiliated persons and entities.""\n\nIn response to the report, the FBI said it has already implemented dozens of corrective actions that have been in place for some time.\n\nThe report criticised the FBI for opening a full-fledged investigation based on ""raw, unanalysed and uncorroborated intelligence,"" saying the speed at which it did so was a departure from the norm.\n\nIt said investigators repeatedly relied on ""confirmation bias"", ignoring or rationalising away evidence that undercut their premise of a Trump-Russia conspiracy as they pushed the probe forward.\n\nPolitical implications of report\n\nMr Durham\'s report was released to Congress on Monday without redactions, after it was delivered to Attorney-General Merrick Garland on Friday.\n\nMr Durham and his team cast a broad net, interviewing top officials at the FBI, Justice Department and CIA.\n\nIn his first year on the job, he travelled with Mr Barr to Italy to meet with government officials as Mr Trump himself asked then-Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and other leaders to help with the probe.\n\nHis findings are likely to become political fodder for Mr Trump, who is planning to run for re-election in 2024 despite facing criminal charges in New York and two federal investigations by Special Counsel Jack Smith that are looking both at Mr Trump\'s retention of classified records and his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMr Trump had hoped Mr Durham would release his report ahead of the 2020 election, in what he thought would be a blow to President Joe Biden\'s campaign.\n\nBut Mr Durham\'s investigation has largely failed to produce a meaningful impact, after two separate juries acquitted both defendants he tried to prosecute in 2022.\n\nIn one case Mr Durham brought, a Washington DC jury acquitted Hillary Clinton\'s former campaign attorney Michael Sussmann on charges he lied to the FBI when he met with the bureau in September 2016 to share a tip about possible communications between Mr Trump\'s business and a Russian bank.\n\nMr Durham\'s investigation was dealt yet another major set-back just a few months later, when a jury in Virginia acquitted Russian researcher Igor Danchenko of charges that he lied to the FBI when he was interviewed about the sources of information he provided that became part of a document known as the Steele dossier.\n\nThat document, penned by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, made allegations about ties between Mr Trump\'s 2016 election campaign and Russia and contained salacious details — many of which were never substantiated.\n\nAn investigation by the Justice Department\'s inspector general later found that the FBI improperly continued to rely on unsubstantiated allegations in the Steele dossier when it applied for court-approved warrant applications to monitor the communications of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nMr Durham did secure a successful guilty plea against former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith, who was singled out in the inspector general\'s report, for altering an email that was used to justify a government wiretap application for Mr Page.\n\nMr Durham\'s report echoed many of the concerns the inspector general previously raised about the rigour of the FBI\'s process for applying to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for wiretap applications.\n\nThe FBI has since implemented numerous reforms to the process.'}, 10: {'URL':

Eventually, the judge stropped trying to control Trump – he and the attorney general’s lawyer questioning Trump let him rant, and then mostly disregarded the missives.\n\nThe high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. Engoron has already ruled Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The New York attorney general’s office said they will rest their case after Ivanka Trump’s testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand:\n\nTrump’s campaign comes to the courtroom: The former president’s rhetoric at times during his testimony might as well have been at one of his rallies in front of supporters. He went after the attorney general. The judge. And the “political witch hunt” that he’s been railing against for years now. On the witness stand, the charged rhetoric was even more remarkable, as he attacked the judge sitting right next to him, with James in the courtroom watching his testimony just feet away. “The fraud is on the court, not on me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump gets an angry response from the judge: Judge Engoron tried at the outset of Trump’s testimony to stop the former president from making speeches and instead answer the questions, but it did little to change Trump’s approach. The judge responded by threatening to remove Trump from the witness stand, though that didn’t deter the former president either. “This is not a political rally,” Engoron said to Trump, telling Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise to “control your client.”\n\nTrump acknowledges changing valuation of Trump Tower triplex: The attorney general’s office pressed Trump on the properties central to his identity and brand: Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and other key parts of his real estate empire. The AG’s office attorney Kevin Wallace also pressed Trump on why valuations of properties were changed, such as his Trump Tower triplex, which was devalued on his financial statement in 2017 after a Forbes article found he had dramatically exaggerated the size of the apartment. Trump acknowledged there had on occasion been mistakes, such as the Trump Tower apartment valuation.\n\nTrump’s descriptions of his properties: The former president’s rhetorical flourishes went beyond attacking those who are investigating him. He also took the opportunity to play salesman and play up his properties. One of his chief complaints about the judge is a citation in his decision that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18 million, a number based on Florida tax appraisal records “It’s much more valuable,” Trump said of Mar-a-Lago, “and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes, that it’s biggest value is using it as a club.” Wallace took the answer to pin him down on that valuation. “You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” Wallace asked. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here.\n\nTrump finishes testimony in fraud trial; Ivanka Trump to testify Wednesday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has stepped down from the stand after nearly four hours of testimony in the civil fraud trial against him and his company.\n\nThe next witness will be his daughter Ivanka Trump on Wednesday, after which the attorney general’s office plans to rest its case.\n\nTrump’s attorney Chris Kise said he believes the trial should end in mid-December.\n\nTrump on whether he maintained accurate records from August 2014 onward: ""I hope so""\n\nWhen asked by the Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office whether he “maintained accurate books and records” from August 2014 going forward, Donald Trump said “I hope so.”\n\n“I hope so, I didn’t keep them myself. I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nTrump questioned about the value of Mar-a-Lago\n\nDonald Trump says he believes Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\n“You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” asked Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nThe valuation of Mar-a-Lago has been one of Trump’s complaints about the judge in the trial, after the judge cited a Florida tax appraisal of $18 million for the property in his decision finding Trump, his adult sons and his company committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nWallace asked Trump if he approved of valuing Mar-a-Lago as if it would be sold to an individual as a resident. “Did I approve it on this? I don’t know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump replied, “I don’t remember that, no” when asked if he explicitly told former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg or former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney to value the property that way.\n\nWallace confronted Trump with a 2002 deed of development rights that shows Trump deeded away his right to use the property as anything other than a social club.\n\nTrump then gave a long aside about Mar-a-Lago when Wallace asked him about not being able to use it as anything but a social club.\n\n“I don’t mind leaving it as a club. In fact, if somebody wanted it, smartest thing to do, have a club and have one member and that would be the member that lives in the club. But it’s much more valuable — and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes — that its biggest value is using it as a club,” Trump said.\n\nWallace showed Trump a 2003 article in which the former president told a reporter Mar-A-Lago will always be a club.\n\n“I think that was said with bravado more than legal intent,” Trump said on the stand.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nWhat the scene is like inside the courtroom as Trump takes the stand\n\nIt was an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump took the witness stand a bit ago in New York. The former president slowly climbed a couple of steps into the box and raised his hand to take the oath.\n\nFormer presidents are typically surrounded by a force-field of deference, due to their status and are accompanied everywhere by Secret Service agents.\n\nBut Trump, in a blue suit, shirt and blue tie rather than his typical campaign uniform of white shirt and red tie, is sitting in the witness box alone in a leather chair, with wood panels on either side. His hands are clasped in his lap, and a large bottle of water and two smaller ones are to his left beside a screen allowing him to see court documents.\n\nThis is a civil trial rather than a criminal one. And the American people can’t see it because it’s not televised. But this the moment when the reality of the 2024 campaign hit home. Trump is simultaneously a multiple defendant, as well as being the Republican front-runner and potential next US president.\n\nThis is the most extraordinary campaign in modern history in microcosm.\n\nTrump says he would on occasion make suggestions on financial docs at heart of the trial\n\nFurther questioning in today’s civil fraud trial turned toward the financial documents at the heart of the trial, with Donald Trump saying he would look at financial statements, and on occasion make suggestions.\n\nTrump says of his statements of financial condition, “I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions.”\n\nThe former president says that bankers didn’t pay much attention to his financial statements, and says that is going to be part of their defense.\n\n“We’ll explain that as this trial goes along. This crazy trial goes along. Because we’re bringing in the bankers. Very big bankers,” Trump says. “They will explain exactly what their process is.”\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to. They looked at the deal,” he testified.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nJudge overseeing Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order on Friday\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order in the trial to extend to Trump’s attorneys after they raised multiple questions about the judge’s communications with his law clerk.\n\nIn a written order Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron prohibited Trump’s attorneys from making any further comments about confidential communications between the judge and his staff inside or outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe judge said violating the order would result in “serious sanctions.”\n\nAnalysis: Trump heads to the witness stand as the latest polls show him leaping past Biden in key swing states\n\nA year away from Election Day 2024, former President Donald Trump is set to testify in a civil fraud trial and separately faces more than 90 criminal charges, setting up the possibility that a convicted felon tops the Republican ticket next November.\n\nBut it’s President Joe Biden’s political prospects that are plunging.\n\nIn another extraordinary twist to a 2024 campaign season that is more notable for court hearings than treks through early voting states, Trump is expected to be called to the witness stand in New York on Monday. This is hardly typical activity during a post-presidency. But Trump was, after all, the most unconventional president.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is absorbing brutal new polls showing him losing to GOP front-runner Trump in multiple key swing states. The numbers will likely ignite panic among Democrats and renew doubts among Americans that the soon-to-be-81-year-old is up to a full second term. If the New York Times/Siena College survey is borne out in 2024, there would be no electoral path to victory for Biden. And an increasingly authoritarian Trump – who is promising a second term of “retribution” – could pull off a White House comeback in spite of sparking a Capitol insurrection with his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020.\n\n“I was concerned before these polls, and I’m concerned now,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“These presidential races over the last couple of terms have been very tight. No one is going to have a runaway election here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, concentration, resources. And so we have our work cut out for us.”\n\nThe coinciding crises facing both Trump and Biden belie the fact that, for all their deficiencies, neither is yet to face a serious challenger from within their parties as they seek the nomination.\n\nBiden’s position is weakening as he tackles cascading global threats such as the war in the Middle East, sheds support over his handling of the economy and sees cracks in the multiracial coalition that first elected him. It also reflects a nation that is divided and disconsolate, and groping for the elusive normality that the president promised three years ago after the pandemic and the historic turbulence of the Trump administration.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nHas a former president ever given testimony in his own civil trial?\n\nWhen Donald Trump takes the stand in his New York civil fraud trial Monday, it won’t be the first time a former president will have given testimony in his own defense in a lawsuit.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did it twice more than a hundred years ago, both when he sued a Michigan newspaper that accused him of being a drunk and later when he was sued by a fellow New York Republican whom Roosevelt had called a corrupt political boss.\n\nRoosevelt won both cases. Trump, by contrast, has already been found liable for fraud by the judge in New York.\n\nThose Roosevelt trials, separated by two years, were each sensational at the time, and they came after Roosevelt’s final campaign for the White House, when he placed second to Democrat Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after splitting with Republicans and running as a Progressive.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is very much still in the arena, and his legal strategy in a slew of civil and criminal cases is tied to his concurrent presidential campaign. He has argued that two gag orders – the one issued against him by a federal judge in Washington, DC, and the other by the civil trial judge in New York – hinder his ability to speak as a candidate.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-testifies-new-york-fraud-trial/', 'Headline': 'Trump clashes with judge, defends business record in testimony at New ...', 'Snippet': ""Trump takes stand in New York fraud trial 03:58.

He said New York Attorney General Letitia James ""should be ashamed of herself.""\n\nOver the course of four hours on the stand on Monday, Trump repeatedly strayed from the questions, earning reprimands from New York Judge Arthur Engoron on several occasions. The judge, who was seated just feet away from Trump, will decide the outcome of the bench trial himself.\n\nThe case stems from a $250 million civil lawsuit filed by James\' office, which accused Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives of a yearslong fraud scheme. The state alleges the defendants inflated the value of the company\'s assets and Trump\'s personal wealth to obtain better terms on loans and insurance. The attorney general is seeking to recoup $250 million and limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York. The defendants have all denied wrongdoing, and Trump has repeatedly accused James of pursuing him for political reasons.\n\nIn his testimony, the former president and current front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination stood by the valuations of various Trump properties that other co-defendants have sought to distance themselves from.\n\n""The numbers of my net worth are substantially more than the numbers reflected on the financial statements,"" he said in one exchange. ""Therefore you have no case.""\n\nTrump\'s testimony\n\nTrump arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan shortly before 10 a.m. and made brief remarks, reiterating his criticism of the trial.\n\n""It\'s a terrible, terrible thing. These are political operatives that I\'m going to be dealing with right now,"" Trump said. ""It\'s a very sad situation for our country.""\n\nOutside the courtroom, James predicted Trump would ""engage in name-calling, taunts and race-baiting,"" but said, ""At the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friend, don\'t lie.""\n\nTrump then took the stand. Kevin Wallace, a lawyer from the attorney general\'s office, kicked off the questioning by asking Trump about a trust he established to manage his assets before he entered the White House. When he left office in 2021, he took control of the trust, only to relinquish it again in July 2021. He testified that he did so because of increasing legal pressure from a number of fronts.\n\n""You and about every other Democrat district attorney, A.G., and U.S. attorney were coming at me from 15 different sides, all Democrats, Trump haters,"" Trump said, adding that he had ""great confidence"" in his son to manage his assets.\n\nTrump repeatedly gave long-winded answers to questions about the valuations of various Trump Organization properties, and Engoron\'s patience soon wore thin. Christopher Kise, one of Trump\'s attorneys, encouraged Engoron to allow Trump to give answers in his own way.\n\n""With this witness I would suggest it\'s far more efficient to listen to what he has to say and take it in,"" Kise said, prompting laughter from Wallace.\n\nEngoron\'s voice rose as his anger seemed to boil over, and his microphone struggled to handle the sudden change in volume.\n\n""No, I\'m not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron said, his voice rising. ""I\'m here to hear him answer questions. Sit down!""\n\nEngoron said he was considering drawing negative conclusions from Trump\'s testimony.\n\n""We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can\'t, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can,"" Engoron said.\n\nAfter a break, Wallace posed questions about the valuations of Trump\'s and his company\'s properties, including Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower in Manhattan and an upstate New York estate known as Seven Springs. Trump defended the financial statements listing their supposed value, saying that even those valuations that have been determined to be inflated were too low. He added that he would not be willing to sell several properties because they were worth so much.\n\nJames\' office says the documents, known as statements of financial condition, inflated his net worth by billions. Trump said the documents included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies.\n\n""The disclaimer clause says if there\'s a mistake, if there\'s something, don\'t rely on it,"" Trump said. ""[The disclaimers] always hold up in court, except maybe this court.""\n\nTrump also insisted that increases in property values over time justified overvaluations in the past, an argument Engoron has previously rejected. Discussing property valuations for 2014, Trump said, ""If you carry that forward to 2021, all of those valuations were low.""\n\nTrump became particularly animated during discussion of Mar-a-Lago, the Florida club where he resides for most of the year. Engoron\'s pretrial ruling finding Trump liable for fraud noted that the local assessor valued Mar-a-Lago at $18 million, while in documents Trump valued it at hundreds of millions more. The former president said in his testimony that he believes it\'s worth as much as $1.5 billion.\n\nThe property is ""deed-restricted"" and cannot be used as a residence, which experts previously told CBS News limits its value. Trump said he agreed to the deed restriction for tax purposes, acknowledging that the lower assessed value limits the property\'s tax burden. He then described a hypothetical scheme in which a person calls their own home a club to save money on taxes.\n\n""There are a lot of advantages to the club status, the smartest thing to do would be to have a club and have one member,"" Trump said.\n\nHe later argued about whether it was accurate to value one of his Scottish golf clubs as if he has built nearly 2,500 new homes on it, when in fact he has built none and is limited by contract to just under 1,500.\n\n""At some point maybe in my very old age I\'ll go there and do the most beautiful thing you\'ve ever seen,"" the 77-year-old said.\n\nLater in the day, Trump described a loan related to Chicago property as having been ""long since gone."" Pressed on that detail, he conceded it was actually paid off ""very recently.""\n\nWallace then asked, ""Are you aware that the Trump Chicago loan was paid off last week?""\n\nTrump said he was, and that, ""my son recommended it,"" referring to Eric Trump, who testified about that and other properties on Nov. 2 and 3.\n\nTrump said his company has begun looking into whether it needs to change internal policies as a result of the state\'s investigation.\n\n""There will be recommendations made, and we will perhaps let you know what those recommendations are, it wouldn\'t bother me to let you know about it. But we have asked,"" Trump said, adding that Eric Trump has been in charge of communicating with accountants and lawyers about that process.\n\nHe was excused from the witness stand shortly before 3:30 p.m., with the defense team declining to pose questions.\n\nThe fraud trial\n\nTrump is accused in the civil suit of being the primary beneficiary of a scheme to fraudulently portray his wealth as far greater than it is, and his properties as far more valuable, in order to get undeservedly favorable loan and insurance terms. The judge in the case has already found Trump, his two adult sons and their company liable for fraud, determining that the scheme led to hundreds of millions in unearned profits.\n\nThe trial is focused on other allegations, including falsification of business records, conspiracy and insurance fraud, as well as disgorgement — the exact amount of ""ill-gotten gains"" the Trumps must pay the state.\n\nTrump and his company have for more than a year blamed their former outside accountants, Mazars USA, for any inaccuracies in their statements of financial condition, essentially a snapshot of Trump\'s wealth. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump reiterated that defense in testimony last week, saying they ""trusted"" internal and external accounting teams.\n\nBut their former Mazars accountant testified in October that his firm merely compiled reams of financial information provided to them by the Trumps and their company.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking $250 million and sanctions designed to limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York, including permanently barring Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director in any business in the state.\n\nReporting contributed by Katrina Kaufman.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/12/13/1219154099/trump-fraud-trial-hears-final-witness-before-closing-arguments-begin-in-january', 'Headline': 'Trump fraud trial hears final witness before closing arguments ... - NPR', 'Snippet': ""With the words the people rest, testimony concluded today in the $250 million civil fraud trial against former President Donald Trump. NPR's Andrea Bernstein is here to talk about the overall case ..."", 'Full_text': 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nWith the words the people rest, testimony concluded today in the $250 million civil fraud trial against former President Donald Trump. NPR\'s Andrea Bernstein is here to talk about the overall case and what\'s coming next. Hey there.\n\nANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.\n\nSHAPIRO: So to recap, Trump was supposed to testify this week, and he changed his mind at the last minute, said he wasn\'t coming. So how did the case end up?\n\nBERNSTEIN: With a battle of the expert witnesses. Trump\'s final witness was an accounting professor at New York University who said he saw no accounting fraud in Trump\'s financial statements. So the AG put on a rebuttal witness, an accounting professor from another prestigious New York school, Cornell University, to say, wait a minute, that\'s not how it\'s done. The professor, Eric Lewis, testified that Trump had not followed the rules when it came to valuing his properties. Lewis wasn\'t five minutes into his testimony before Trump lawyer Charles Kise (ph) started objecting very strenuously, which prompted the assistant attorney general, Kevin Wallace, to erupt - referring to the professor - he\'s been qualified as an expert. Kise said, not in the real world. Wallace said, he is out of order. And that\'s kind of how the case ended up.\n\nSHAPIRO: Sounds like a lot of drama in the courtroom. Was that pretty typical of how the last 10 weeks of testimony have gone?\n\nBERNSTEIN: Yeah. So the differences in the way the parties see the facts got pretty heated at times. The AG\'s theory is that Trump lied and lied about the value of his assets, that he fudged the books, and that a result - as a result of that lying, Trump made hundreds of millions of dollars that he shouldn\'t have made. And the judge has partially endorsed that theory. Even before the trial began, he issued a ruling saying the AG had proven persistent and repeated fraud. So the trial was really about the issue of intent and how much in ill-gotten gains Trump will have to pay back to the state. For its part, the defense argued no one was harmed. The main bank involved in all of this, Deutsche Bank, wanted Trump as a client in its private wealth division and was willing to give him great loan rates and that Trump properties are, well, all spectacular and able to command top dollar.\n\nSHAPIRO: All throughout this trial, Trump has had a running commentary outside of the courtroom. Has that affected what\'s going on inside the court?\n\nBERNSTEIN: Inside the courtroom, which he visited nine times, Trump had to be quiet, to rise when the bailiff yelled, all rise. He had to sit through - one of his attorneys said at the outset would be, quote, ""excruciating detail."" She made good on that, by the way. Donald Trump did testify vociferously as part of the AG\'s case, but he seemed to be getting the most energy from these quick hallway scrums he held outside the courtroom where he called the trial rigged and the judge biased - pre-butting (ph) a possible bad verdict. It\'s kind of like how he said the 2020 election was going to be rigged before balloting had even started.\n\nSHAPIRO: So when are we going to see the verdict?\n\nBERNSTEIN: The judge asked for legal briefs January 5. The briefs will be argued January 11, and then there will be a verdict sometime in the weeks after that. For context, the Iowa caucus is January 15. The New Hampshire primary is January 23. So sometime around then.\n\nSHAPIRO: That\'s NPR\'s Andrea Bernstein. Thanks.\n\nBERNSTEIN: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL CAESAR SONG, ""DO YOU LIKE ME?"")\n\nCopyright © 2023 NPR.

He goes on to claim there is ""murder on the streets of New York and the attorney general here is watching every little move”.\n\nDuring this outburst, Judge Engoron looks ahead with a straight expression and remains silent.\n\nWhen Trump has finished, Engoron says he defers to the prosecution on how much they want to allow Trump to speak off topic.\n\nEngoron says Trump is a ""broken record"", to which Trump replies that the prosecution ""keeps asking the same questions, over and over"".\n\nAttorney Kevin Wallace keeps his calm, saying the questioning is ""very close to the end"".\n\nTrump may attack judge to \'play the victim\' - law professor\n\nBernd Debusmann Jr\n\nUS reporter\n\nTrump\'s testimony so far seems to suggest that ""he does not take the trial very seriously,"" according to a US law professor.\n\nCarl Tobias, law professor at the University of Richmond, told me that Trump appears to be ""jousting"" and ""taunting"" Judge Engoron - despite the fact that he will ultimately be the one to decide the fate of the case.\n\n""Trump\'s behaviour suggests that he may view the trial as an opportunity to play the victim of an unfair justice system and, thus, attempt to capitalise on the trial to score political points"".\n\nProfessor Tobias added that Trump ""may also be hoping to win on appeal"" and has already appealed Judge Engoron\'s finding of fraud.\n\n""But that approach may be risky,"" he added.\n\nTrump\'s return to the stand is more subdued\n\nKayla Epstein\n\nReporting from court\n\nSo far, Trump has been far more subdued in the afternoon session.\n\nHe\'s mostly answering prosecutor Kevin Wallace\'s questions with brief, on-topic responses - just like Judge Ergonon repeatedly asked him to do all morning.\n\nAt one point Trump waits to answer because he believes Judge Engoron had not ruled on an objection.\n\nWhen the judge indicates he can proceed, Trump defers.\n\n""Sorry,"" he told Judge Engoron, giving him the nod.\n\nIt\'s a very different tone from his repeated political attacks on the judge that characterised the morning schedule.\n\nBut we\'re 15 minutes in, and Trump\'s demeanour could change at any moment.\n\nTrump says banks were \'thrilled\' by loans\n\nMadeline Halpert\n\nReporting from court\n\nProsecutors are continuing to go through a series of documents with Trump about several loan agreements, including Trump International Hotel in Chicago.\n\nKevin Wallace is asking Trump about whether statements of financial condition were included in the loan.\n\nTrump is evading the issue of the financial statements and continuing to talk about how much cash and other assets he has.\n\n“I could’ve just shown a couple of assets and they would have been very satisfied,"" he says.\n\n""This loan was paid off in full,"" he adds. ""The bank was thrilled. It was a very successful loan as opposed to other people that don’t have successful loans.""\n\nTrump says he had more than $300m in cash when he got a loan\n\nChloe Kim\n\nReporting from court\n\nThe line of questioning after lunch has been all about Donald Trump and Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe prosecution is highlighting a term loan agreement from 2012, between Trump and the bank.\n\nThe agreement said he must maintain a minimum net worth of $2.5bn. Trump says he was aware of this.\n\nTrump says he had about $300-400m in cash at the time.

The post was deleted on social media, but remained on his website.\n\nJudge Engoron threatened Trump with more fines and potential jail time if he violates the gag order again.\n\nPrior to the order, Trump had repeatedly made personal attacks on the judge and called him ""deranged"" and a ""rogue adjudicator"".\n\nTrump says he did not violate gag order\n\nBrandon Livesay\n\nReporting from New York City\n\nDonald Trump and his team stayed in the courtroom for about 15-20 minutes after recess was called.\n\nHe just emerged and spoke with waiting reporters, but said he “can’t tell you” what they were doing for so long inside the room.\n\nWhen asked if he violated a gag order with his comments earlier today, Trump said he did not.\n\nHe says he wasn’t speaking about the clerk when he told media that the person “sitting alongside” the judge was “perhaps even more partisan than he is”.\n\nMultiple reporters asked Trump who he was talking about, to which he replied “any other questions?”\n\nHe also said “the judge is a democrat, but I do respect the judge”.\n\nJudge angry with Trump\'s \'partisan\' comments during break\n\nChloe Kim\n\nReporting from court\n\nDuring that court break, Donald Trump spoke with reporters.\n\nHe said: ""this judge is a very partisan judge with a person who’s very partisan sitting alongside of him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is"".\n\nJudge Engoron has interpreted that as an attack on his law clerk, who Trump has previously made ""disparaging"" remarks about.\n\nThe judge says he feels very protective of his staff and adds: ""I don’t want anyone to get killed"".\n\nLast week, Trump violated a gag order over comments about the clerk, and was fined $5,000.\n\nThe judge said he previously accepted the explanation that the violation was ""inadvertent"".\n\nKise, Trump’s lawyer, says his client was talking about Michael Cohen - not the law clerk.

Engoron asked Trump’s lawyer. ""This is not a political rally. This is a courtroom.""\n\nEngoron at one point said Trump’s answers were repetitive and irrelevant and warned that he might dismiss Trump as a witness, though that never came to pass.\n\nTRUMP SAYS PROPERTY VALUATIONS NOT IMPORTANT\n\nTrump testified that his company did not provide accurate estimates of the value of some of his trophy properties to banks.\n\nRelated:\n\n10 Safest States in America\n\nSome properties, like his Mar-a-Lago estate and Doral golf course in Florida were undervalued, he said, while others like his Trump Tower residence in New York and his Seven Springs estate north of the city were overvalued.\n\nHe said that should not matter because the estimates included language stating that they might not be accurate and banks did not take them seriously.\n\n""You’ve made it important, but it wasn’t,"" Trump said in reference to the New York Attorney General\'s office that brought the case.\n\n\'I HAVE A CASTLE\'\n\nNew York state lawyer Kevin Wallace asked Trump if he built any houses in Aberdeen, Scotland between 2013 and 2014, when the value of his property there increased substantially.\n\n“I have a castle,” Trump replied, one of many times where he did not directly answer the question posed.\n\nReferring to a residential development in Aberdeen, Trump said: ""I just don’t want to build it now. You’ve probably read, I’m doing other things.""\n\n\'HOPE THE PUBLIC IS WATCHING\'\n\nTrump grew increasingly agitated as the day wore on, reprising the same inflammatory remarks about Engoron and New York Attorney General Letitia James that he has routinely made throughout the trial that began on Oct. 2.\n\n""This is a very unfair trial, very, very unfair, and I hope the public is watching,"" said Trump, a Republican who has accused elected Democrat James of political bias.\n\n(Reporting by Jack Queen and Luc Cohen; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Grant McCool)'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-trial-testimony-ends-months-fireworks-courtroom-rcna129076', 'Headline': 'Trump trial testimony ends after months of fireworks in and outside ...', 'Snippet': 'Testimony has wrapped in the $250 million civil fraud trial against former President Donald Trump and his company after more than two months of fireworks in and outside of the courtroom.', 'Full_text': 'Testimony has wrapped in the $250 million civil fraud trial against former President Donald Trump and his company after more than two months of fireworks in and outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe final witness was Eric Lewis, an accounting professor at Cornell University, who New York Attorney General Tish James\'s office put on the stand Wednesday to rebut the testimony of an NYU accounting professor who testified earlier on Trump\'s behalf.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is expected to issue his verdict and findings sometime next month, after both sides present their closing arguments on Jan. 11.\n\nThe trial started on Oct. 2nd, and there were 44 days of testimony featuring 25 witnesses for the AG\'s office, 19 defense witnesses and two rebuttal witnesses — fewer than originally proposed.\n\nJames\' office set out to show how financial statements Trump used to get favorable loans from banks were steeped in fraud with grossly inflated values. Trump\'s team tried to show he did nothing wrong, that the statements were largely accurate and that any mistakes weren\'t his fault. Along the way were plenty of spectacles, with testimony from the former president and his family members, gag orders, fines, angry exchanges and dramatic showdowns.\n\nHere\'s a look at some key moments from the trial.\n\nA former president on the witness stand\n\nWhile Trump abruptly decided not to take the stand in his defense earlier this week, the former president spent a remarkable day on the witness stand as part of the AG\'s case last month, where he repeatedly ripped into James and Engoron.\n\n“I think she’s a political hack,” Trump said of James, also labeling Engoron a “very hostile judge, extremely hostile judge.”\n\nTrump said he was especially upset with Engoron\'s pretrial finding that Trump had committed persistent fraud.\n\n“He ruled against me and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me, nothing about me,” Trump said of Engoron, who has overseen legal disputes between Trump and the attorney general’s office for years.\n\nA spat over Mar-a-Lago\n\nOut of all the fraud claims lodged by the AG, the one that appeared to bother Trump the most was one involving his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe AG\'s office noted that Trump valued Mar-a-Lago at between $426 million and $612 million on his financial statements between 2011 and 2021. The Palm Beach County Assessor, meanwhile, appraised the property\'s market value to be between $18 million and $27 million in the same time period. The AG\'s office also noted the financial statements valued the property as a private home, while Trump had signed an agreement with the county that it could only be used as a social club.\n\nTrump repeatedly complained about the AG citing the tax valuation and Engoron\'s pretrial finding that not disclosing the club restriction was fraudulent. “The judge had it at $18 million. And it is worth, say, I say from 50 to 100 times more than that. So I don’t know how you got those numbers,” Trump testified, adding later that he thinks it\'s actually worth ""between a billion and a billion five.” He\'s also complained about the valuation to reporters in court on the days he\'s attended the trial, at political rallies and on his Truth Social website.\n\nThe second to last defense witness in the case, Palm Beach real estate broker Lawrence Moens, brought a video he shot of the property with him that he played during his testimony. He said he valued the property at over $1 billion, and invited the AG to tour the property in person. ""I’ll make sure he is not there when you come,"" he said, referring to Trump.\n\nTrump was slapped with a gag order, and penalized for defying it\n\nTrump attended several days of the trial, and some of his comments to reporters during breaks came back to bite him. On the second day of trial, Trump referred reporters to a post on his social media platform Truth Social, where he shared the identity of the judge\'s law clerk and falsely accused her of having a personal relationship with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\n“You saw what was just put out about Schumer and the principal clerk? That is disgraceful,” Trump said. The judge ordered the post be removed and issued a gag order barring Trump from talking about his court staff, saying such attacks ""are unacceptable, inappropriate and I won’t tolerate it."" He later fined Trump $5,000 after it was revealed the post was still on a campaign website weeks later and threatened further sanctions, including jail time.\n\nThe judge later expanded the gag order to include Trump\'s lawyers as well. Trump’s attorneys are appealing the gag orders and the fines against their client.\n\nTrump storms out of the courtroom\n\nOn Oct. 25, Engoron fined Trump another $10,000 after finding he told reporters outside the courtroom that Engoron is “a very partisan judge with a person who’s very partisan sitting alongside him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is.”\n\nThe judge took that as a reference to his law clerk, who sits next to him and who Trump had alleged was politically biased against him. He ordered Trump to take the witness stand, and he testified he was referring to that day\'s witness, his former attorney turned outspoken critic Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump has publicly called Cohen all sorts of names since he turned against him, but ""partisan"" has not been one of his insults. The judge said he found Trump\'s testimony ""not credible"" and fined him. ""Don’t do it again, or it will be worse,” Engoron warned.\n\nA short time later, Trump stormed out of the courtroom- seeming to surprise his lawyers and his Secret Service agents.\n\nTrump reunited with an old friend-turned-foe\n\nMichael Cohen\'s testimony was the first time he\'d come face to face with his former boss in five years. James has said she launched her investigation into Trump after Cohen testified about his business practices to the House Oversight Committee on Capitol Hill in 2019.\n\nTrump came to court for Cohen\'s testimony and appeared to be enjoying himself while his attorney Alina Habba got Cohen to acknowledge he\'d lied under oath in a previous court case. Cohen, who said he was involved in preparing some of the financial statements, also said Trump never directly told him to inflate values. Trump used that statement to declare victory in the case to reporters and his lawyers asked the judge to rule in the case in their favor.\n\nUnder further questioning from the AG, Cohen testified it wasn\'t Trump\'s style to make direct requests. He compared Trump to a “mob boss” who tells you what he wants without directly telling you.\n\nFormer accountant blames the Trumps\n\nThe AG\'s first witness was the Trump\'s former accountant, Donald Bender. Bender testified that he compiled the financial statements, called statements of financial condition, using information and valuations provided to him by executives at Trump\'s company, the Trump Organization. He said he relied on company officials, including former CFO Allen Weisselberg and senior vice president Jeff McConney, to provide him with accurate information. Asked at one point if he\'d subsequently learned the company had been holding information back from him, Bender said, “Yes.” He said that they’d failed to turn over “paper documents over a number of years.”\n\nWeisselberg and McConney testified as well. All three had also testified in the Manhattan district attorney\'s criminal tax fraud trial against the Trump Organization last year. The company was convicted and fined and Weisselberg, who pleaded guilty to falsifying business records, was sentenced to five months in jail.\n\nTrump family blames the accountants\n\nThe former president, his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., Weisselberg and other company officials all pointed a finger back at Bender and their other accountants during their testimony.\n\n""All I did is authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary for the accountants to do a statement. In other words, we supplied them with what they needed. And if they didn\'t get it, they wouldn\'t do the statement,"" Trump said.\n\nTrump Jr., who\'s now running the company with his brother, said “I rely on the accountants” for the statements. “They were intimately involved in every aspect” of the statements, he said.\n\nEric Trump said, “I relied on a very big accounting office. I relied on one of the biggest accounting firms in the country. And I relied on a great legal team, and when they gave me comfort that the statement was perfect, I was more than happy to execute it.” He also suggested the statements weren\'t the type of thing he paid much attention to. “I pour concrete. I operate properties. I don’t focus on appraisals,” he said.\n\nIvanka Trump, a former executive at the company, also testified during the AG\'s case and said she was not involved with the statements, but assumed they were documents that ""he would work on with his own accountants.""\n\nTrump accounting expert says \'no evidence\' of fraud\n\nThe final defense witness was Eli Bartov, an accounting professor at NYU. Bartov, who was paid almost $900,000 for his work on the case by Trump\'s company and his political action committee, testified that “my analysis shows the statements of financial condition for all the years were not materially misstated.”\n\n“My main finding is that there is no evidence whatsoever for any accounting fraud,” he said.\n\nThe judge asked him whether his expert opinion from an accounting perspective was that the AG’s claims had no merit. “Absolutely,” he replied.\n\nTrump, who attended the trial on the first day of Bartov\'s testimony, called Bartov “a very strong witness, a very powerful witness and a highly respected person.”\n\nA fond farewell\n\nAt the start of the last day of testimony Wednesday, Engoron said, “In a strange way. I am going to miss this trial. It has been an experience.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/highlights-of-donald-trump-s-hours-on-the-witness-stand-at-his-new-york-civil-fraud-trial-1.6635320', 'Headline': ""Highlights of Donald Trump's civil fraud trial testimony | CTV News"", 'Snippet': ""Donald Trump went off.

Again and again. Making the witness stand at his civil fraud trial his podium, the former president laid into the judge who\'ll decide the case and the New York attorney general who\'s suing him.\n\nDuring 3 1/2 hours of testimony on Monday, the Republican denied Attorney General Letitia James\' allegations that he duped banks by exaggerating his wealth on financial statements used to make deals and secure loans.\n\n""There was no victim. There was no anything,"" he said.\n\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\nHe bragged about his riches, saying he has ""a lot of cash"" and described one of the grown sons he put in charge of his company as a ""hard working boy."" He said of his priorities while president: ""My threshold was China, Russia and keeping our country safe.""\n\nTrump\'s often verbose responses -- replete with anecdotes about development projects, the intricacies of property valuations and complaints that he was a victim of a ""political witch hunt"" -- led a frustrated Judge Arthur Engoron to warn: ""This is not a political rally.""\n\nHere are some highlights from Trump\'s day on the witness stand:\n\n\'A VERY UNFAIR TRIAL\'\n\nTrump made his grievances a focal point of his testimony, amplifying complaints the 2024 Republican front-runner has made for weeks in front of TV cameras outside the courtroom.\n\nHe directed a lot of his ire against the judge, who issued a decision before the trial even began holding Trump liable for fraud.\n\n""He ruled against me without knowing anything about me,"" Trump testified. ""He ruled against me, and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me, nothing about me. I think it\'s fraudulent, the decision. I think it\'s fraudulent. The fraud is on the court, not on me.""\n\nDuring the trial, the judge has fined Trump $15,000 for violating a limited gag order barring attacks on court staff. But nothing in the order bars the former U.S. president from criticizing the judge.\n\nEngoron did try to clamp down on Trump\'s speechifying during his testimony.\n\n""I\'m not here to hear what he has to say. I\'m here to hear him answer questions,"" Engoron told one of Trump\'s lawyers. The former U.S. president retorted: ""This is a very unfair trial, very, very. And I hope the public is watching it.""\n\nEngoron\'s admonition only gave Trump more ammunition to claim he was being mistreated. Trump later posted Engoron\'s ""not here to hear what he has to say"" comment to his Truth Social account.\n\nOn the witness stand, Trump suggested the judge should\'ve showed him deference as a former president, testifying, ""How do you rule against somebody and call them a fraud, as the president of the United States, who did a great job?""\n\nSTATEMENTS \'WEREN\'T VERY BADLY NEEDED\'\n\nIn defending his business practices, Trump sought to downplay the importance of the annual statements of financial condition at issue in the case. He testified that the documents, which listed values for his properties and assets, were ""nice to see"" but ""weren\'t very badly needed"" to obtain financing and make deals.\n\nEven when banks required Trump to provide copies of his financial statements as part of a loan agreement, he testified that they really wanted to know if he had enough cash to cover the loan. Trump testified that he typically kept $300 million to $400 million in the bank, saying, ""I\'ve had a lot of cash for a long time.""\n\n""They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to,"" Trump testified. ""They looked at the deal. They looked at the asset. If it is real estate, they looked at the location.""\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump waits to take the witness stand at New York Supreme Court, Monday, Nov. 6, 2023, in New York. (Curtis Means/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nRetired Deutsche Bank official Nicholas Haigh testified earlier in the trial that the bank, which loaned Trump hundreds of millions of dollars, would look to his financial statements to ensure that his ""financial strength is being maintained.""\n\nTrump testified that he relied on two longtime Trump Organization executives and an outside accounting firm to prepare his financial statements. He said ex-CFO Allen Weisselberg would give him a draft before each year\'s statement was finalized and that he\'d ""look it over and maybe have a suggestion.""\n\n""But it wasn\'t very important,"" Trump testified. ""You\'ve made it important. But it wasn\'t very important to me.""\n\nA \'VERY, VERY POWERFUL\' DISCLAIMER\n\nTrump testified that he had no qualms with how his financial statements turned out and that, if anything, they undervalued some of his properties. Regardless, he said, the statements had a ""disclaimer clause that was very, very powerful"" that absolved him and his company of responsibility.\n\nTrump said the disclaimer instructed banks and others: ""Do your own due diligence. Do your own work. Do your own study. Don\'t take anything from this statement for granted.""\n\nThe disclaimer said, among other things, that the financial statements weren\'t audited by outside accountants.\n\nTrump mentioned the disclaimer more than a dozen times, at one point irking Engoron, whose pretrial ruling found that the clause didn\'t insulate Trump from liability.\n\n""No, no, no. We are not going to hear about the disclaimer clause,"" the judge bellowed. ""If you want to know about the disclaimer clause, read my opinion again, or for the first time, perhaps.""\n\n""Well, you are wrong on the opinion,"" Trump responded.\n\n\'A VERY SAD THING\' FOR EX-CFO\n\nAs Trump wrapped up his testimony, he expressed sorrow for Weisselberg, his longtime finance chief who pleaded guilty and served jail time last year for evading taxes on pricey company-paid perks, including a Manhattan apartment, luxury cars and private school tuition for his grandchildren.\n\nAt a trial largely built on Weisselberg\'s testimony, Trump\'s company was convicted last year of helping executives dodge taxes on such perks. The Trump Organization was ordered to pay a $1.6 million fine.\n\n""It was a sad, very sad thing,"" Trump testified. ""People went after him viciously and violently because he happened to work for me.""\n\nTrump testified that he\'d learned of Weisselberg\'s tax misdeeds only through last year\'s trial, where the ex-executive testified that his schemes were unknown to his boss. Despite the revelation about his trusted lieutenant, Trump said he never thought to go back and review Weisselberg\'s work.\n\n""The education of his grandchildren -- that is going to be some kind of a breach where you want to put a man in jail? It\'s a very sad thing,"" Trump lamented.\n\n\'A DISGRACE\' AND \'DISTRACTIONS\'\n\nTrump looked away from Attorney General James and sneered as he walked past her on the way into court. On the witness stand, he tore into the Democrat, accusing her of pursuing him to advance her political career.\n\n""She\'s a political hack, and this a disgrace that a case like this is going on,"" Trump testified, adding that James ""should be ashamed of herself.""\n\nTrump also directed his enmity at Kevin Wallace, the lawyer from James\' office who was questioning him, saying: ""People like you go around and try and demean me and try and hurt me. Probably for political reasons. In her case, definitely for political reasons.""\n\nJames made a short-lived run for New York governor in 2021 before winning reelection as attorney general last year.\n\nOutside court Monday, James said Trump was ""engaging in distractions and engaging in name calling"" to steal attention from the evidence against him.\n\nAT MAR-A-LAGO, \'FOREVER\' ISN\'T NECESSARILY FOREVER\n\nTrump suggested he or his heirs could someday depart from a decades-old agreement that limits the use of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nTrump\'s financial statements have valued the sprawling Palm Beach club as high as $739 million, based on what James\' office argues is a false premise that it could be sold as a private residence. Real estate agents say it\'s possible it could fetch $1 billion as a home. Trump claims the property is now worth up to $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2002, Trump signed an agreement with the National Trust for Historic Preservation that limited Mar-a-Lago\'s use to a social club. From the stand, Trump argued that language in the document stating that he did ""intend to forever"" use the estate as a club didn\'t necessarily mean forever.\n\n""It doesn\'t say I will. It says `intend,""\' Trump testified, adding: ""I would, personally, never change it. If somebody later on, including my children, if they want to change it, I believe they would have a right to do that.""\n\nShown a 2003 article in The Palm Beach Post that quoted him saying ""it will forever be a club,"" Trump responded, ""I think that was said with bravado, as opposed to with legal intent.""\n\nTrump acknowledged benefiting from the deal, testifying that as a club ""you pay much less tax.""'}}",94.5,2

Here’s a look at how many people attended those rallies, crowd size photos, and what happened at each.\n\nBiden Hosted a Socially Distanced, Drive-In Rally Attended By Close to 300 Cars\n\nBiden hosted a rally at the Florida State Fairgrounds. Unlike Trump’s rally, Biden’s was a drive-in rally that enforced social distancing. NBC News reported that Biden’s rally was attended by close to 300 cars.\n\nWhen Biden spoke in Tampa on Thursday evening, he said that Trump had just hosted “a superspreader event here again. He’s spreading more than just the virus, he’s spreading division,” he said.\n\nBiden also advocated for wearing masks. “This isn’t a political statement, it’s a patriotic duty,” he said. “But still, Donald Trump refuses to listen to science.”\n\nWhile Trump’s rally earlier in the day used water hoses to help cool down supporters, Biden’s rally was interrupted by a heavy downpour of rain, which led to the rally ending early, NBC News reported. Biden told the crowd that he was shortening his speech. “Get out of the rain!” he advised.\n\nBiden spoke about topics like healthcare, the pandemic, and taxes. Supporters honked in their cars to show support.\n\nBiden’s rally enforced social distancing, shared Angie Angers of Bay News 9. She said masks were mandatory if people left their cars and they were asked not to gather in groups.\n\nRaymond Arroyo, a contributor to Fox News, shared the following photos comparing the two rallies:\n\nThousands Attended Trump’s Rally\n\nZac Anderson of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune said the campaign told him that 15,000 tickets were requested. The number of attendees was estimated as being in the “thousands” and the crowd was packed together tightly.\n\nA large crowd greeted Trump outside Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. The temperature was 87 degrees and so hot that a fire truck sprayed water on the crowd near the back to help them stay cool, TMZ reported.\n\nSome people passed out because the rally got so hot, shared Monica Alba of NBC News. She said medics were being called every five to 10 minutes because of the heat. NBC News later reported that 17 people needed medical attention and about a dozen had to go to the hospital.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump was at the rally and introduced Trump.\n\nThousands attended Trump’s rally, Alba shared, and although they were given masks, some told her that they didn’t feel the need to wear them.\n\nThe crowd was packed shoulder-to-shoulder for the rally.\n\nThis video also shows the crowd.\n\nZac Anderson of the Herald Tribune said the campaign told him that 15,000 tickets were requested. The number of attendees was estimated as being in the “thousands” and the crowd was packed together tightly.\n\nTrump spoke about his platform during his speech, including the economy. He also talked about Hunter Biden and joked that people told him not to do so.\n\nTrump also addressed the pandemic, saying that a vaccine was near and the pandemic was “rounding the corner.”'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-vs-biden-dramatic-difference-media-treat-each-campaign', 'Headline': 'Trump vs. Biden: A dramatic difference in how the media treat each ...', 'Snippet': 'Former U.S. President Donald Trump points after delivering remarks at a campaign rally at The Ted Hendricks Stadium at Henry Milander Park on November 8, 2023, in Hialeah, Florida.

Donald Trump’s is not, at least not in the Republican primaries.\n\nYou might think that the current president’s legislative achievements would give him the edge, but that’s not getting any traction–certainly not compared to the fact that he turns 81 next week.\n\nYou might think that the former president, facing four criminal indictments and a civil fraud trial, would be the one whose campaign is flailing. A single indictment would drive any other politician out of business. But the cascade of charges has actually helped Trump, boosting his standing among those who believe he’s the target of deep-state persecution.\n\nTHE MEDIA\'S CREDIBILITY IS SHOT THANKS TO SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS AND DONALD TRUMP\n\nBiden, for whatever reason, isn’t getting credit for pushing through legislation ranging from infrastructure to climate change (though the announcement of grants make local headlines). Inflation remains a major public concern, even though the monthly rate announced yesterday, 3.2 percent, was lower than October’s 3.7 percent rise.\n\nTrump, 77, has been testing the limits of gag orders in the federal case involving Jan. 6 and in the New York civil fraud case brought by the state attorney general. On Truth Social, he reposted a follower’s dream: ""MY FANTASY: I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LITITIA [sic] JAMES AND JUDGE ENGORON PLACED UNDER CITIZENS ARREST FOR BLATANT ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND HARASSMENT.""\n\nHis supporters love that stuff.\n\nIn the panic that spread after polls found Trump leading Biden in key swing states, some in the media are offering the president advice on rescuing his faltering campaign.\n\nPolitico columnist Jonathan Martin, saying Biden is ""in peril,"" says that ""to deny his difficulties and complain about press coverage may be therapeutic, but it doesn’t make him any likelier to defeat Trump once more…The oldest president in history when he first took the oath, Biden will not be able to govern and campaign in the manner of previous incumbents. He simply does not have the capacity to do it.""\n\nA SOBER, SUBSTANTIVE DEBATE AS HALEY AND DESANTIS FEND OFF ATTACKS\n\nAmong Martin’s suggestions: Recall Rahm Emanuel from his posting in Tokyo to run the campaign and lure back Ron Klain. Court Joe Manchin into not mounting a third-party bid, and Liz Cheney as well. Attack Republicans more aggressively. Delegate the war by naming Bill and Hillary Clinton as special envoys to the Middle East.\n\nAfter the president’s former Obama colleague David Axelrod suggested he consider dropping out, the piece says: ""Calling David Axelrod ‘a prick,’ as a person who has heard Biden use the word says he does in private, is not a strategy to win 270 electoral votes.""\n\nThe most urgent advice for Democrats ""was for him to heave ‘Bidenomics’ into the dumpster. Attempting to make voters believe something they don’t is folly. Attaching your name to that strategy borders on masochistic.""\n\nZing!\n\nI don’t agree that Biden should spend a lot of political capital ripping Trump, at least right now. The media are already doing the heavy lifting.\n\nEver since it dawned on the mainstream press that Trump could well win a second term, a series of articles in the Washington Post and New York Times has warned of all the terrible things that he might do, such as invoking the Insurrection Act to quash domestic dissent. While Trump’s two top campaign aides have dismissed that as ""speculation,"" the reports say the 45th president has been discussing such ideas with others, not that he’s made any final decisions.\n\nBesides, the Trump team clearly cooperated with a lengthy Times story on his planned crackdown on illegal immigrants, including deporting millions, making former official and current adviser Stephen Miller available for on-the-record details.\n\nAt the same time, Trump says exactly what he’s going to do, telling Univision that after what’s been done to him, of course he would seek indictments of his political enemies.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE\'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY\'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nAnd Trump serves up thick slabs of red meat for his base. On Saturday, he posted: ""In honor of our great Veterans on Veteran’s Day, we pledge to you that we will root out the Communists, Marxists, Fascists, and Radical Left Thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our Country.""\n\nThat sparked a backlash and headlines like this one in Forbes: ""Trump Compares Political Foes To ‘Vermin’ On Veterans Day—Echoing Nazi Propaganda.""

The Trump campaign did not answer an inquiry for this article.\n\nSome of the statistics cited on projections at Donald Trump’s rally Dec. 16, 2023, in Durham, N.H. (Rebecca Catalanello/PolitiFact)\n\n""Under Joe Biden, we’ve had a three-year inflation rate of 20%.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe standard inflation measure, the consumer price index, has risen by 17.2% since January 2021, when Biden took office. That was an increase over three years, so the annual inflation rate was lower — about 5.9% per year during Biden’s presidency.\n\nRising wages have helped consumers manage some of this increase in prices.\n\nA standard wage measure, average hourly earnings of all private-sector employees, has risen by 14% during Biden’s presidency, or about 4.8% per year. That means wages are still trailing inflation by about 1.1% a year, but it’s a smaller gap than Trump’s headline number.\n\nThe time frame for the calculation also matters.\n\nAs inflation has cooled over the past year, wage gains have narrowed the cumulative shortfall from inflation. Since November 2022, inflation has risen by 3.1%, but wages have risen by 4%. If the pattern holds, wage growth during Biden’s presidency may soon surpass the increase in prices.\n\nAlso, Americans are in a better place than they were on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, which started during Trump’s last year in office. Since February 2020, the last full month before the pandemic hit, inflation has increased by 18.8%, while wages have increased by 19.4%.\n\n""After three years of Bidenomics, the 30-year mortgage rate has hit a 22-year high.""\n\nThis is Mostly True. Numerically, Trump is on target. However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage peaked at 7.79% on Oct. 26, 2023. That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.\n\nMortgage rates have spiked because the Federal Reserve in March 2022 began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Fed interest rate hikes are considered the most effective economic tools for curbing inflation, because they tend to cool the economy, which eases demand and lowers prices.\n\nSince the Fed hikes began, inflation has receded by about two-thirds. But a side effect has been that other types of interest rates — including mortgages — have also risen.\n\nSince the mortgage rate peak in October, the average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has fallen, hitting 6.67% on Dec. 21. Not counting the peak in recent months, that’s still higher than any rate going back to Aug. 2, 2007, when the rate was 6.68%.\n\nEconomists generally agree that some of Biden’s policies likely added to the pressures that pushed up prices.\n\nBiden’s coronavirus relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, put stimulus money into Americans’ hands when supply chains couldn’t produce enough goods to fulfill consumer demand. This worsened the rise of prices, which started because of pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions.\n\nHowever, ""the drivers of this inflation go back to COVID-19 — issues like supply-chain constraints, workforce shortages, and other factors,"" John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, told PolitiFact West Virginia in October. ""That is much larger than any particular Biden policy.""\n\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said Biden should ""assume some responsibility, but so should members of Congress who voted in favor of stimulus payments, tax cuts, generous unemployment benefits, aid to states and private businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic recession.""\n\nThe American Rescue Plan got no Republican support in Congress, but earlier pandemic relief bills Trump signed were passed with bipartisan support.\n\n""The average monthly mortgage payment: Under Trump, $1,746; Under Biden: $3,322.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThese are the figures for average monthly payments on a new home, real estate company CBRE reports. That’s a significant out-of-pocket increase for someone buying a new home, but it doesn’t affect homeowners who aren’t looking to move.\n\nThe figure is calculated for the purchase of a new home valued at the U.S. median of $430,000, with a 10% down payment.\n\nThe majority of American mortgage holders have fixed-rate mortgages that were locked in at much lower rates. In 2022, about 85% of mortgages had fixed rates.\n\nGiven the current high rates, adjustable-rate mortgages are gaining popularity. If mortgage rates decrease in 2024, homeowners who hold adjustable-rate mortgages should see their payments drop.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/trump-pennsylvania-rally-republicans/671344/', 'Headline': 'Biden Laid the Trap.

This past Thursday night, in Philadelphia, Joe Biden upped the ante by asking, in effect: What idiot thing might the former president do if baited with a whole speech? On Saturday night, the world got its answer.\n\nFor the 2022 election cycle, smart Republicans had a clear and simple plan: Don’t let the election be about Trump. Make it about gas prices, or crime, or the border, or race, or sex education, or anything—anything but Trump. Trump lost the popular vote in 2016. He lost control of the House in 2018. He lost the presidency in 2020. He lost both Senate seats in Georgia in 2021. Republicans had good reason to dread the havoc he’d create if he joined the fight in 2022.\n\nHow likely is Trump’s return, and what should we expect? Explore these questions with David Frum, Jeffrey Goldberg, and others at The Atlantic Festival on Wednesday, September 21. Register and find out more here.\n\nSo they pleaded with Trump to keep out of the 2022 race. A Republican lawmaker in a close contest told CNN on August 19, “I don’t say his name, ever.”\n\nMaybe the pleas were always doomed to fail. Show Trump a spotlight, and he’s going to step into it. But Republicans pinned their hopes on the chance that Trump might muster some self-discipline this one time, some regard for the interests and wishes of his partners and allies.\n\nOne of the purposes of Biden’s Philadelphia attack on Trump’s faction within the Republican Party was surely to goad Trump. It worked.\n\nYesterday, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Trump addressed a rally supposedly in support of Republican candidates in the state: Mehmet Oz for the Senate; the January 6 apologist Doug Mastriano for governor. This was not Trump’s first 2022 rally speech. He spoke in Arizona in July. But this one was different: so extreme, strident, and ugly—and so obviously provoked by Biden’s speech that this was what led local news: “Donald Trump Blasts Philadelphia, President Biden During Rally for Doug Mastriano, Dr. Oz in Wilkes-Barre.”\n\nYes, you read that right: Campaigning in Pennsylvania, the ex-president denounced the state’s largest city. “I think Philadelphia was a great choice to make this speech of hatred and anger. [Biden’s] speech was hatred and anger,” Trump declared last night. “Last year, the city set an all-time murder record with 560 homicides, and it’s on track to shatter that record again in 2022. Numbers that nobody’s ever seen other than in some other Democrat-run cities.”\n\nTrump spoke at length about the FBI search of his house for stolen government documents. He lashed out at the FBI, attacking the bureau and the Department of Justice as “vicious monsters.” He complained about the FBI searching his closets for stolen government documents, inadvertently reminding everyone that the FBI had actually found stolen government documents in his closet—and in his bathroom too. Trump called Biden an “enemy of the state.” He abused his party’s leader in the U.S. Senate as someone who “should be ashamed.” He claimed to have won the popular vote in the state of Pennsylvania, which, in fact, he lost by more than 80,000 votes.\n\nThe rally format allowed time for only brief remarks by the two candidates actually on the ballot, Oz and Mastriano. Its message was otherwise all Trump, Trump, Trump. A Republican vote is a Trump vote. A Republican vote is a vote to endorse lies about the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOn and on it went, in a protracted display of narcissistic injury that was exactly the behavior that Biden’s Philadelphia speech had been designed to elicit.\n\nEvery day since the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago has brought new proof that Trump still dominates the Republican Party. He has extracted support even from would-be rivals like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis—rituals of submission within a party hierarchy that respects only acts of domination.\n\nRepublican congressional leaders desperately but hopelessly tried to avert the risk that this next election would become yet another national referendum on Trump’s leadership. Despite Trump’s lying and boasting, politicians who can count to 50 and 218—the respective numbers needed for a majority in the Senate and House—have to reckon with the real-world costs of Trump’s defeats. But Biden understood their man’s psychology too well.\n\nBiden came to Philadelphia to deliver a wound to Trump’s boundless yet fragile ego. Trump obliged with a monstrously self-involved meltdown 48 hours later. And now his party has nowhere to hide. Trump has overwritten his name on every Republican line of every ballot in 2022.\n\nBiden dangled the bait. Trump took it—and put his whole party on the hook with him. Republican leaders are left with little choice but to pretend to like it.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://heavy.com/news/trump-commerce-georgia-rally-crowd-photos/', 'Headline': ""How Many Attended Trump's Georgia Rally?

Opinions on how large the crowd was varied from person to person attending.\n\nThousands Attended Trump’s Georgia Rally, With Some Saying Attendance Was Smaller than Normal & Others Saying Attendance Was ‘Massive’\n\nThe rally took place at the Banks County Dragway (formerly known as the NHRA International Dragway) in Commerce, Georgia. Although doors opened in the afternoon, Trump’s speech was scheduled to begin around 7 p.m. Eastern, but he began about an hour late, Athens Banner-Herald reported.\n\nThe event was in part to support local Republican candidates or politicians, Athens Banner-Herald reported. Those on the speakers list included Herschel Walker and Sen. David Perdue who is running for governor. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was also among the people scheduled to speak.\n\nOpinions about crowd size varied. Some in attendance said the crowd was “massive.” However, other reporters said the crowd was much smaller than Trump used to attract. Here’s a look at the various reports. It’s not known if local police will share an official estimate, but we will add it to this story if they do.\n\nStephen Fowler of GPB News (an NPR affiliate) attended the rally and estimated on Twitter that there were about 5,000 people in attendance. He wrote that it was “the smallest Trump rally I’ve ever covered here.” He said it was much smaller than the 20,000 to 30,000-size rallies that Trump had hosted in 2020.\n\nGreg Bluestein of Atlanta-Journal Constitution shared a photo during the rally indicating that the crowd behind the TV risers didn’t extend “as far as the eye could see,” as Trump had said it did.\n\nFowler also shared a photo of the crowd, which was large but didn’t extend quite as far back as past rally crowds have done.\n\nHowever, Joshua L. Jones of the Athens Banner-Herald tweeted that around 5:30 p.m. Eastern, there was a “massive crowd” at the rally, and shared a photo of a packed crowd.\n\nBurt Jones, a conservative running for Lieutenant Governor, described the crowd as “huge.”\n\nTrump quickly began his speech by calling the current Governor Brian Kemp a “RINO,” as he supported one of Kemp’s opponents. He commented that he was angry that he had supported Kemp in the past.\n\nFowler later shared a photo showing the crowd differences between 8:50, 8:20, and 7:20. He said the cold and windy weather was leading some to leave early, while Trump was still speaking.\n\nTrump also commented to attendees that he believed Georgia was “red as hell” and voting for Perdue would be “a vote for this country.”\n\nAt one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz said he would nominate Trump to be the Speaker of the House.\n\nThis happened while Trump was bringing some of the candidates he endorsed, along with others, to speak on the stage with him.\n\nTrump Has Two More Rallies Scheduled\n\nTrump has two more rallies scheduled over the next two weeks, according to his website. A rally in Washington, Michigan, is taking place on April 2 at 7 p.m. Eastern at the Michigan Star Sports Center. And a rally in Selma, North Carolina, is taking place on April 9 at 7 p.m. Eastern at The Farm at 95.\n\nTrump’s first rally of 2022 was in Florence, Arizona in mid-January. Trump held a September rally in Georgia. He also held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, in October 2021, a rally in Alabama in August 2021, and an Ohio rally in June 2021. He also held a rally in Conroe, Texas, in January that was attended by tens of thousands, according to media at the event.\n\nIn his August Alabama rally, he was booed after telling the people present to take the vaccines. He replied: “You know what? I believe totally in your freedoms, I do. You have to do what you have to do. But, I recommend take the vaccines, I did it, it’s good. Take the vaccines.”\n\nTrump has not yet announced if he is running in the 2024 presidential election. However, he did tell the crowd during his speech in South Carolina that “we may have to run again,” and added “we will take back the White House.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://heavy.com/news/biden-georgia-rally-how-many-crowd-photos/', 'Headline': ""Biden's Georgia Rally Attendance: See Crowd Size Photos - Heavy.com"", 'Snippet': 'President-elect Joe Biden held a rally in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday, January 4 — the day before the Senate runoff elections.

Raphael Warnock. The rally took place in the parking lot at Turner Field, AJC reported.\n\nDespite the rally being a socially distanced, drive-in rally, some photos revealed that while attendees wore masks, not all were actually social distancing. Deadline referred to the crowd as “somewhat socially distanced” and noted that about 500 cars were parked in attendance at the rally.\n\nBiden advocated for the Democrat candidates in the runoff, in part because of the stimulus checks. He told the group: “If you send Jon and the reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door, restoring hope and decency and honor for so many people,” he said.\n\nHe also noted: “And if you send (Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler) back to Washington, those checks will never get there…”\n\nDuring his speech, Biden told attendees: “The power is literally in your hands, unlike any time in my career. One state, one state can chart the course not just for the next four years but for a generation.”\n\nHe also stated: “The debate over $2,000 isn’t some abstract debate in Washington, it’s about real lives. Your lives, the lives of good, hardworking Americans… If you’re like millions of Americans all across this country, you need the money, you need the help, and you need it now.”\n\nBiden criticized Trump’s approach to the vaccine rollout and the pandemic, saying: “This administration has gotten off to a God-awful start.

American voters are much more likely to see Biden as too old than say the same about Trump. The Monmouth (“Mon-muth”) University Poll finds that Biden’s support in a potential rematch against Trump has slipped over the past two months. This has mainly come from a decline in the Democrat’s support among Black, Hispanic and Asian voters, while Trump has made some gains among this group. The poll also finds differing views of Trump’s current legal woes and the impeachment inquiry into Biden. However, both, along with the Hunter Biden court case, factor into the outlook for a potential rematch of the 2020 election.\n\nThree-quarters (76%) of American voters agree that Biden is too old to effectively serve another term as president. Just under half (48%) say the same about Trump.* In fact, 55% of voters strongly agree with this assessment of Biden’s age while 26% strongly agree with the same statement about Trump. As may be expected, there are partisan differences in these results, with Republicans (23%) being much less likely than other voters to think Trump is too old and Democrats being less likely – although still a 56% majority – to say Biden is too old. There are no sizable differences by age within each party on these views.\n\n“These two men were born only three and a half years apart, but public perceptions of their age are wildly different. This is certainly one of the reasons, but probably not the only reason, why there is little voter enthusiasm for seeing a rematch of 2020 except among partisan loyalists,” said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\nJust 37% of voters express at least some enthusiasm about the possibility of Trump being the Republican nominee and 32% are enthusiastic about Biden getting the nod for the Democrats. Majorities are not at all enthusiastic about either Trump (52%) or Biden (53%) being at the top of their respective party tickets. Among independents, 35% are enthusiastic about having Trump as the GOP nominee and only 19% feel enthusiastic about Biden heading the Democratic ticket. Among partisans, just under 8 in 10 Republicans and just under 7 in 10 Democrats say they are enthusiastic about the current front-runner becoming their respective party’s nominee, with Republicans (47%) being much more likely than Democrats (29%) to feel very enthusiastic about that potential outcome. Among Democrats, 60% of those under 65 years old are at least somewhat enthusiastic about Biden becoming their nominee, which is a lower level than among those age 65 and over (83%). There are no significant age differences in Republican voter enthusiasm about Trump becoming their nominee.\n\nIn a Biden-Trump rematch scenario, just over 4 in 10 registered voters say they will either definitely (31%) or probably (11%) vote for the Democratic incumbent and a similar number will definitely (31%) or probably (12%) support the Republican. Majorities, though, say they will not vote for either Biden (51% definitely not and 6% probably not) or Trump (48% definitely not and 8% probably not). These results mark a drop in Biden’s potential support since July (from 47% to 42% combined) while Trump’s support has ticked up slightly (from 40% to 43%). Biden’s decline is due mainly to a significant slip in support among Black, Latino, and Asian voters (from 63% definitely or probably in July to 47% now). Trump has picked up about half of that number (going from 23% among voters of color in July to 33% now.\n\nThe Monmouth University Poll also looked at the impact of current legal issues surrounding both candidates. Regarding Trump’s response to the 2020 election outcome, just under half of American voters (46%) think he committed a crime, 22% say he did something wrong but it was not criminal, and 29% said he did nothing wrong. For the incumbent, who is now facing an official impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives, 34% say Biden should be impeached and 16% say he may have violated his office but should not be impeached, while a plurality of 43% say Biden has not violated his oath of office in his actions as president so far.\n\nJust 15% of the electorate has a lot of trust, 33% has a little trust, and 50% has no trust in the House to conduct a fair investigation into Biden. Back in November 2021, when the House formed a select committee to investigate then-President Trump, a slightly higher number (26%) had a lot of trust in that investigation, 31% had a little trust and 41% had no trust. Interestingly, Republicans (29%) are less likely to have a lot of trust in the current inquiry into Biden than Democrats (58%) had in the first Trump impeachment investigation.\n\nMore voters (93%) have actually heard about the recent legal troubles of the president’s son, Hunter, than have heard about the current impeachment inquiry (79%). Just over one-fourth (27%) of the electorate say that the younger Biden’s legal woes make them less likely to vote for the incumbent. Most of the voters who say the Hunter Biden issue may impact their vote identify themselves as Republicans and are unlikely to support the Democrat anyway. Voters who currently support Biden and say this issue may affect their support make up about 2% of the total electorate and another 2% identify as Democrats who do not currently support Biden.\n\n“The actual impact of the Hunter Biden story may be small in statistical terms but one or two percentage points could be crucial in competitive states,” said Murray.\n\nThe Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from September 19 to 24, 2023 with 814 adults in the United States.

Interviews were conducted in English, and included 280 live landline telephone interviews, 286 live cell phone interviews, and 248 online surveys via a cell phone text invitation. Telephone numbers were selected through a mix of random digit dialing and list-based sampling. Landline respondents were selected with a modified Troldahl-Carter youngest adult household screen. Interviewing services were provided by Braun Research, with sample obtained from Dynata (RDD, n= 532), Aristotle (list, n= 106) and a panel of prior Monmouth poll participants (n= 176). Monmouth is responsible for all aspects of the survey design, data weighting and analysis. The full sample is weighted for region, age, education, gender and race based on US Census information (ACS 2021 one-year survey). The results in this poll release are based on a subsample of 737 registered voters. For results based on the sample of registered voters, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling has a maximum margin of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points adjusted for sample design effects (1.54). Sampling error can be larger for sub-groups (see table below). In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.\n\nDemographics (weighted)\n\nParty (self-reported): 24% Republican, 44% Independent, 31% Democrat\n\nSex: 47% Male, 52% Female\n\nAge: 26% 18-34, 33% 35-54, 41% 55+\n\nRace: 62% White, 12% Black, 16% Hispanic, 10% Asian/Other\n\nEducation: 36% High school or less, 30% Some college, 18% 4 year degree, 17% graduate degree\n\nClick on pdf file link below for full methodology and crosstabs by key demographic groups.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-09-06/poll-california-voters-biden-age-trump-legal-problems-presidential-race-primary', 'Headline': ""Trump's on track to sweep California's delegates, poll shows - Los ..."", 'Snippet': ""A UC Berkeley/L.A. Times poll finds Republicans strongly favor Trump in California's 2024 primary, though voters are concerned about his and Biden's vulnerabilities."", 'Full_text': 'Former President Trump dominates his rivals so heavily that he’s on track to win all of California’s delegates for next year’s Republican convention — a haul that would give him a major chunk of the votes needed to secure his third presidential nomination.\n\nThe finding from a new UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times highlights a turnabout from earlier this year. In February, Trump faced a serious challenge from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis among California Republicans.\n\nThe potential for Trump to win all of the state’s delegates also reflects his campaign’s work to change the rules of the contest to his advantage.\n\nIn late July, the California Republican Party changed its rules so that if a candidate wins more than 50% of the statewide vote in the state’s March 5 primary, he or she will claim all 169 GOP delegates — the most of any state in the nation. Previously, the rules allocated delegates by congressional district. A candidate needs just over 1,200 convention delegates to win the nomination.\n\nTrump’s campaign pushed for the rule change, one of a series of such shifts it has backed in states across the nation. All of the changes supported by his campaign have the effect of helping a front-runner quickly nail down the Republican nomination.\n\nThe new poll shows about 55% of likely Republican voters plan to cast their primary ballots for Trump. DeSantis’ support has plummeted to 16% — less than half of what he had earlier this year.\n\n“Californians have turned away, by and large, from DeSantis,” said Mark DiCamillo, director of the UC Berkeley institute’s poll. “The biggest beneficiary of DeSantis’ decline is the former president. There’s no question he’s well-liked by the Republican base.”\n\n“It’s a startling development given the fact that over the past year, there appeared to be sentiment among Republicans looking for an alternative to Trump,” DiCamillo added. “That has changed, and Trump is now the odds-on favorite.”\n\n“Capturing all of California’s delegates would give Trump a huge advantage over the rest of the field,” he noted.\n\nThe state party’s rule changes were one factor in the recent decision by a super PAC backing DeSantis to stop major campaign operations in California and several other states, NBC News reported last week.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the poll indicated President Biden holds a big lead ahead of California’s primary, with 66% of party voters supporting him, compared with 9% for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and 3% for Marianne Williamson. About 1 in 6 likely Democratic voters said they were undecided.\n\nBiden gets less support from young, Latino and Asian American voters than from white and Black voters. That difference in enthusiasm is unlikely to hurt his chances in California, given his wide lead, but it reflects a problem for the president that could be serious elsewhere in the nation.\n\nBiden also holds a big lead over Trump in a prospective general election matchup in the state, not surprising given California’s cobalt-blue tilt.\n\nOf the state’s 22 million registered voters, 46.9% identify as Democrats, 23.8% as Republicans, 22.5% as no party preference and 6.8% with other parties, according to the California secretary of state’s most recent statistics.\n\nThe poll also looked at some important vulnerabilities for each of the two leading candidates.\n\nAmong the state’s likely voters, 42% said they believe Biden’s age — he turns 82 shortly after election day — will hurt him a lot in his reelection bid, compared with 32% who think Trump’s legal woes will hurt him a lot in his effort to win back the White House.\n\nThose legal difficulties may be on display just before the state’s primary. On March 4, the former president is scheduled to go on trial in Washington on federal charges that he illegally sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to Biden.\n\nCalifornia shares its primary date with Texas, North Carolina and about a dozen other states, which together will allocate more than a third of Republican delegates.\n\nThe survey was conducted Aug. 24-29, shortly after Trump was indicted in Georgia over his alleged efforts to overturn the state’s 2020 presidential election results.\n\nThat indictment was the fourth for the former president. In addition to the Georgia and federal cases alleging efforts to overturn the election, he also faces federal charges over his handling of confidential government documents after leaving the White House, and New York state charges over his payments to a porn actor during the 2016 campaign in an attempt to conceal their affair.\n\nThe polling began one day after the first GOP presidential primary debate, which Trump skipped.\n\nThe survey’s results affirm the dwindling popularity of DeSantis, who shares many of the same beliefs as Trump, but without his legal and temperamental baggage. He has drawn praise from many on the right for his stand against lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as for his vocal advocacy of the conservative side in the nation’s culture wars.\n\nIn February, when many Republicans were still focused on Trump-endorsed candidates’ losses in last year’s midterm election, DeSantis had the support of 37% of likely California Republican voters, while Trump was backed by 29%, according to a Berkeley institute poll. Three months later, a Berkeley survey indicated the former president had rebounded, with the support of 44% of the state’s likely GOP voters, with DeSantis trailing at 26%.\n\nFormer United Nations Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s performance in the first GOP debate appears to have bumped up her support in the latest poll, though she remains mired in the single digits among likely Republican voters in California.\n\nHaley now has the backing of 7% of the state’s likely GOP voters surveyed, double her support in the February poll. Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Vice President Mike Pence, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and conservative talk radio host Larry Elder all trailed behind her. About 9% of the poll’s Republican participants said they supported someone else or were undecided.\n\nLooking ahead at the general election, 51% of the state’s likely voters polled said they would support Biden, the incumbent president, while 31% said they would back Trump. About 13% said they planned to cast ballots for an unnamed third-party candidate, and 5% were undecided.\n\nWhile California’s general election is unlikely to be competitive — it hasn’t been in the last three decades — voters’ attitudes about each candidate’s potential vulnerabilities provide insight into the overall state of the race.\n\nNeither Trump nor Biden received stellar ratings from voters on their ethical behavior, though the current president outpaced the former one — 71% faulted Trump’s personal ethics, compared with 43% who faulted Biden’s.\n\nNearly half, 47%, of likely California voters surveyed said they would be open to supporting a third-party candidate if the 2024 presidential campaign is a rematch of Biden and Trump’s contest three years ago, with 24% saying they would be “very open” to the idea.\n\nWhile a candidate not affiliated with either of the nation’s two main political parties has practically zero chance of winning the White House, DiCamillo said those numbers reflect voter frustration, particularly among those who are less ideologically inclined.\n\n“There’s dissatisfaction. We’ve seen that in other polls,” he said. “It appears to be the most moderate voters, not those on the extremes. Strong liberals and strong conservatives are less open to [a third-party candidate] than those in the middle.”\n\nThe Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies’ poll surveyed 6,030 registered California voters online in English and Spanish, Aug. 24-29, including weighted samples of 1,175 likely Republican primary voters and 2,833 likely Democratic primary voters.\n\nBecause the survey results are weighted to match census and voter registration benchmarks, estimates of the margin of error may be imprecise; however, the results are estimated to have a margin of error of 2 percentage points in either direction for the full sample, 3 percentage points for Democratic primary voters and 4 percentage points for Republican primary voters.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0261927X221085309', 'Headline': 'How the Linguistic Styles of Donald Trump and Joe Biden Reflect ...', 'Snippet': 'The other moral virtues and vices showed only small differences between Biden and Trump (see Table 1).

Elaine Luria, D-Va., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., used witness testimony to piece together Trump\'s actions the afternoon of Jan. 6, as there was not an official call log from the White House that afternoon and nothing included in the presidential daily diary.\n\n""The chief White House photographer wanted to take pictures because it was, in her words, \'very important for his archives and for history.\' But she was told: \'no photographs\',"" Luria said.\n\nWhite House counsel and White House officials testified that Trump did not make any calls to the secretary of defense, the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security during the siege.\n\nAlthough the White House call logs are empty, Trump lawyer and ally Rudy Giuliani\'s call logs show at least two calls between him and the president that day. The committee also noted that other Trump calls that day are known, including several to Republican senators to urge them to delay the certification of Biden\'s win.\n\n\'I\'ve seen the impact that his words have on his supporters\'\n\nA major theme from the hearing was how much television the former president consumed as the chaos and violence unfolded.\n\n""President Trump sat in his dining room and watched the attack on television while his senior-most staff closest advisers and family members begged him to do what is expected of any American president,"" Luria said. ""When lives and our democracy hung in the balance, President Trump refused to act because of his selfish desire to stay in power.""\n\nThe committee played video clips of news coverage from Fox News, to show what Trump watched in real time as he tuned in from his dining room, just off from the Oval Office. He watched as his supporters, donning red caps and chanting his name, overwhelmed and outnumbered police as they flooded the Capitol grounds and attempted to breach the Capitol.\n\nAt 1:49 p.m. ET, just as D.C. police were declaring a riot at the Capitol, Trump tweeted out a video of his speech at the Ellipse earlier that day and did not comment on the violence.\n\nKizinger noted that between 1:49 and 2:24, when Trump posted a subsequent tweet, ""staff repeatedly came into the room to see him and plead that he make a strong public statement condemning the violence and instructing the mob to leave the Capitol.""\n\nThe panel shared video testimony from top advisers and his children imploring Trump to call off the attack.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, a former White House staffer, has previously testified to a conversation between White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\n""I remember [Cipollone] saying something to the effect of, \'Mark we need to do something more. They\'re literally calling for the vice president to be effing hung.\'\n\nHutchinson recalled Meadow responding: \'You heard him Pat, he thinks Mike deserves it, he doesn\'t think they\'re doing anything wrong.\' ""\n\nTrump eventually relented to calls from his aides and allies and recorded a video in the Rose Garden late that afternoon to tell his supporters to leave the Capitol.\n\nThe committee shared a draft of his remarks, which read: ""I\'m asking for you to leave the Capitol region now and go home in a peaceful way.""\n\nBut in the video, Trump went off script, and didn\'t say those words. Instead, he repeated his false claim that the election was stolen and praised the rioters, saying, ""Go home, we love you.""\n\nThursday\'s witnesses were Trump aides who resigned following Jan. 6\n\nTestifying live Thursday were Matthew Pottinger, Trump\'s deputy national security adviser at the time, and Sarah Matthews, Trump\'s deputy press secretary. The pair resigned following the events of Jan. 6, dismayed by what they deemed an inadequate response from the president at quelling the violence.\n\nMatthews recalled the 2:24 p.m. ET tweet from Trump that read, in part: ""Pence didn\'t have the courage to do what should have been done.""\n\n""I thought that the tweet about the vice president was the last thing that was needed in that moment. And I remember thinking that this was going to be bad for him to tweet this because it was essentially him giving the green light to these people telling them that what they were doing at the Capitol and entering the Capitol was OK, that they were justified in their anger,"" said Matthews, who described herself as a ""life-long Republican"".\n\nShe added that as a Trump campaign aide, she had seen the impact his words had on his supporters. ""They truly latch on to every word and every tweet that he says, and so I think that in that moment for him to tweet out the message about Mike Pence, it was him pouring gasoline on the fire,"" she said.\n\nMatthews said White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her ""in a hushed tone"" that Trump ""did not want to include any sort of mention of peace in that tweet.""\n\nShe said McEnany told her ""it took some convincing on their part those who were in the room and she said that there was a back and forth going over different phrases to find something that he was comfortable with, and it wasn\'t until Ivanka Trump suggested the phrase \'stay peaceful\', that he finally agreed to include it.""\n\nPottinger said he was ""disturbed"" by Trump\'s tweet attacking Pence and that it was ""the opposite of what we really needed in that moment which was a de-escalation.""\n\nThe panel described one of Trump\'s final interactions on Jan. 6, as he departed the White House dining room at 6:27 p.m. ET to go to the residence.\n\n""As he was gathering his things in the dining room to leave, President Trump reflected on the day\'s events with an unnamed White House employee,"" Kinzinger said, adding the employee recalled Trump saying: ""Mike Pence let me down.""\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIn his closing statement, Kinzinger said Trump abandoned his responsibilities as commander-in-chief on Jan. 6.\n\n""Whatever your politics, whatever you think about the outcome of the election, we as Americans must all agree on this: Donald Trump\'s conduct on Jan. 6 was a supreme violation of his oath of office and a complete dereliction of his duty to our nation,"" he said. ""It is a dishonor to all those who have sacrificed and died in service of our democracy.""\n\nHe said when the committee releases its report, it will recommend ""changes to laws and policies to guard against another January 6.""'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/jan-6-committee-final-report/index.html', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 committee releases first transcripts from interviews - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The House Jan. 6 committee released the first of hundreds of interview transcripts it compiled during its investigation into the insurrection at the US Capitol and former President Donald Trump ...', 'Full_text': 'Roger Stone’s interview with the Jan. 6 select committee lasted 51 minutes and pleaded with Fifth Amendment for every question that was asked, the panel’s transcripts show.\n\nStone did not comment on anything the panel put in front of him, including photographs, public statements, video clips of interviews, and text messages. He also took the Fifth when asked basic questions like his age.\n\nStone did not reveal who paid for his private flight from Florida to Washington, DC, in the days before Jan. 6, or who paid for his hotel room at the Willard InterContinental, which is where Stone and other Trump allies set a “war room” on Jan. 6. He also would not confirm which events he was invited to speak at on Jan. 5 and 6, by whom, or if he even attended them at all.\n\nHe was previously convicted of lying to Congress during its investigation into Russian meddling in 2016. Prosecutors argued that he lied to protect then-President Donald Trump, who pardoned him in 2020, before leaving office.\n\nThrough its questioning, the select committee investigators delved into how the Oath Keepers coordinated to protect Stone when he was in Washington, DC, on Jan. 5 and 6, 2021. A group chat through the encrypted messaging app Signal included Stone and Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes, who has been convicted of seditious conspiracy. Stone wrote, “this group is for all event organizers and VIP speakers who need Oath Keepers PSD or event security on Jan 5/6 so they can talk to me and my top OK team leaders all in one place.” Rhodes later messaged that Kelly Meggs from Florida would be Stone’s protection.\n\nThe select committee asked about text exchanges between Stone and “Stop the Steal” rally organizer Ali Alexander, who also was interviewed by the panel, from Jan. 6 where the pair discuss logistics about the rallies that day.\n\n“As I expected, no speaking spot, no VIP entrance for any of my people” Stone said to Alexander at approximately 10:02 a.m. A few hours later, Alexander wrote to stone, “get your ass to the US Capitol” and added “we have a stage & the presidents order.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s one-time national security adviser, Michael Flynn, asserted his Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination to nearly every question asked by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection during his interview with the panel, the transcript of his testimony released Wednesday confirms.\n\nFlynn answered a series of initial questions about his background and military career, acknowledging for example that he joined a group called “The America Project,” which was founded by former Overstock CEO and known election denier Patrick Byrne.\n\nHe also answered when the committee asked if he knew the reason Trump pardoned him.\n\n“Because I think he saw my whole case as a travesty of justice,” Flynn said.\n\nBut when asked why he failed to produce any documents pursuant to the committee’s subpoena, Flynn invoked the Fifth Amendment, ultimately doing so for every other question during the course of his March deposition.\n\nFlynn’s lawyer noted during the interview that his client was appearing before the committee while a lawsuit to quash the panel’s subpoena was still pending.\n\nAmong the questions Flynn responded to by invoking his Fifth Amendment protections, were about his communications with Trump, White House staff, officials at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, officials at the Department of Justice and attorneys representing the former president about election fraud or other irregularities.\n\nMore background: CNN has previously reported that Flynn played a central role in not only spreading baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud and pushed US officials to investigate claims about foreign manipulation of voting machines.\n\nDuring an Oval Office meeting with Trump in mid-December 2020, Flynn also proposed using the federal government to seize voting machines, sources previously told CNN.\n\nHouse Republicans released a report Wednesday focused on security failures at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, highlighting well-documented breakdowns in intelligence sharing, Capitol security and coordination between various law enforcement agencies that responded that day.\n\nTheir primary recommendation centers around reforming the Capitol Police Board and bolstering congressional oversight of the Capitol police force – two issues that were identified by lawmakers of both parties in the wake of Jan. 6.\n\nBut the GOP report is silent on other efforts to disrupt the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election and selective in its criticism of political leaders and their culpability in the security breakdowns on Jan. 6. The report resurfaces largely unfounded allegations to cast blame on Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while glossing over former President Donald Trump’s own role.\n\nRepublicans cast the report as a rebuttal to the House select committee’s investigation into Jan. 6 as they are set to take control of the chamber and endeavor to take back the narrative. Republican lawmakers have said the security failures are paramount and that the select committee overstepped its mandate in its 17-month probe.\n\nThe Democrat-led select committee had planned to release its final report on Wednesday but has delayed the rollout until Thursday. An executive summary released on Monday lays blame for the insurrection squarely on Trump.\n\nMore on the report: The GOP report comes from the five Republicans who Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy initially appointed to serve on the select committee before deciding members of his party would not participate.\n\nIt includes a timeline of events that occurred on Jan. 6, making no mention of the fact that Trump waited hours before calling on the rioters to leave the US Capitol that day and omitting incendiary remarks he made at the rally preceding the attack.\n\nInstead, the report paints Trump as only encouraging his supporters at the White House Ellipse to march to the US Capitol and demonstrate “peacefully,” noticeably omitting other parts of the speech, including when he encouraged rally goers to “fight light hell.”\n\nSimilarly, the timeline includes a tweet Trump sent after the Capitol had been breached, saying: “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”\n\nMissing from the report is Trump’s tweet in which he eventually told the rioters to leave the Capitol – several hours after the deadly riot began.\n\nThe select committee has revealed witness testimony from several former White House officials saying Trump repeatedly refused to call off the rioters despite being asked to do so by a number of his closest advisers.\n\nThe GOP report also doesn’t address Trump’s claim that he issued a directive prior to Jan. 6 to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to the Capitol that day.\n\nTrump’s former Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, in an interview with the select committee, denied Trump gave him formal orders authorizing the deployment of National Guard troops to the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report expected to be released Wednesday.\n\nThe committee is made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nChair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California\n\nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California\n\nRepublicans\n\nVice chair: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nThe final report the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack is set to release Wednesday launches a new era for criminal investigators, politicians, and members of the public who have been eager to see the nuts and bolts of its work.\n\nHere’s what to watch for:\n\nDetail on possible obstruction of the investigation\n\nIn the summary of its report released earlier this week, the panel revealed it is aware of “multiple efforts by President Donald Trump to contact Select Committee witnesses,” adding that DOJ is aware “of at least one of those circumstances.”\n\nThe summary released Monday also claimed the panel has a “range of evidence suggesting specific efforts to obstruct the Committee’s investigation.” That includes concerns that attorneys paid by Trump’s political committee or allied groups “have specific incentives to defend President Trump rather than zealously represent their own clients.”\n\nDetails of Trump’s effort to visit the Capitol\n\nThe summary details that the panel was ultimately unable to get former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato to corroborate a bombshell moment during the public hearings, in which Hutchinson recalled Ornato describing Trump’s altercation with the head of his security detail when he was told he would not be taken to the Capitol following his speech on the Ellipse.\n\nThe committee summary said both Hutchinson and a White House employee testified to the panel about the Ornato conversation. But “Ornato professed that he did not recall either communication, and that he had no knowledge at all about the President’s anger.”\n\nThe committee wrote that it “has significant concerns about the credibility of this testimony” and vowed to release his transcript publicly.\n\nFundraising efforts\n\nIn terms of financing after the 2020 presidential election and through the Jan. 6 rallies, the committee says it gathered evidence indicating that Trump “raised roughly one quarter of a billion dollars in fundraising efforts between the election and January 6th.”\n\n“Those solicitations persistently claimed and referred to election fraud that did not exist,” the panel wrote.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, has said the panel has evidence that members of the Trump family and inner circle – including Kimberly Guilfoyle – personally benefited from money that was raised based on the former president’s false election claims, but the panel has never gone as far to say a financial crime has been committed.\n\nRead more on what to watch for here.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee made a startling allegation on Monday, claiming it had evidence that a Trump-backed attorney urged a key witness to mislead the committee about details they recalled. In the executive summary of the final report, the committee revisited the issue in its handoff of the investigation to the Justice Department.\n\nAccording to the report, “the lawyer had advised the witness that the witness could, in certain circumstances, tell the Committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them.” The committee declined to identify the people.\n\nWhat we know: However, CNN has learned that Stefan Passantino, the top ethics attorney in the Trump White House, is the lawyer who allegedly advised his then-client, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, to tell the committee that she did not recall details that she did, sources familiar with the committee’s work tell CNN. Before her public testimony, Hutchinson dropped Passantino and got a new lawyer.\n\nTrump’s Save America political action committee funded Passantino and his law firm Elections LLC, including paying for his representation of Hutchinson, other sources tell CNN. The committee report notes the lawyer did not tell his client who was paying for the legal services.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Passantino said he didn’t advise Hutchinson to mislead the committee. “I represented Ms. Hutchinson honorably, ethically, and fully consistent with her sole interests as she communicated them to me. I believed Ms. Hutchinson was being truthful and cooperative with the Committee throughout the several interview sessions in which I represented her.”\n\nPassantino pointed out it’s not uncommon for people to change lawyers “because their interests or strategies change,” according to his statement. He also said political committees sometimes cover client fees “at the client’s request.”\n\nBy Tuesday, Passantino’s professional biography had been removed from the website of a midwestern-based law firm where he was a partner – and he acknowledged in his statement he was on a leave of absence from the firm “given the distraction of this matter.” He remains a partner at Elections LLC.\n\nLawyers must follow extensive ethics guidelines as part of their profession, including avoiding conflicts of interest that could compromise their representation of a client. According to legal ethics experts, a lawyer swaying their client’s testimony in a way that wouldn’t be entirely truthful could be looked at as possible obstruction of an investigation.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has started handing over evidence — documents and transcripts — to the Justice Department in the last week, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith had sent a letter to the committee on Dec. 5, requesting all of the information from the panel’s investigation, another source told CNN.\n\nThe information transfer focuses specifically on former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s former election lawyer John Eastman, the source added. The DOJ also received Meadows text messages from the committee.\n\nThe panel also has started to share transcripts of witness interviews pertaining to the false slates of electors and the pressure campaign by the former president and his allies on certain states to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\n“We’ve actually given some transcripts to the Department of Justice during the last month,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the select committee, told CNN Monday.\n\nThe committee also is slated to release its full final report today.\n\nSpokespersons for the committee and for the special counsel did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nThe final report from the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, will include information about Republican National Committee fundraising directly after the 2020 presidential election, what Secret Service knew ahead of the attack and the response by the National Guard, committee member Rep. Pete Aguilar said earlier this month.\n\nThe comments from Aguilar expand on themes the committee has presented in its previous hearings and detail to a new level what is expected to appear in the final report. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, has previously told CNN the panel’s final report will contain eight chapters.\n\nSome information in the report will be redacted due to security concerns, according to Aguilar.\n\nHe added that “there have been some conversations with people who came before us, where we indicated we would redact some small pieces,” such as current workplaces, that are important to protect.\n\nWith its mic drop finale, the House committee investigating the US Capitol insurrection left a fateful question hanging over Washington, Donald Trump and the 2024 presidential campaign: will the ex-president be charged with a crime?\n\nThe committee announced in its final public meeting on Monday it was recommending to the Justice Department that Trump be prosecuted on at least four charges, carefully matching the panel’s catalog of violence, lies, insurrection and dereliction of duty up to and on January 6, 2021, with specific legal statutes.\n\nYet the panel, despite delivering what it called a “roadmap to justice,” has no power to try Trump and its decisions are not binding on the Justice Department.\n\nThe DOJ has its own investigation and faces prosecutorial decisions that require a higher bar than the committee’s political gambits. The potential charges concerned also have little case law precedent.\n\nAnd while both Attorney General Merrick Garland and the House committee have long argued that every American should be subject to equal justice, the gravity of indicting an ex-president and current White House candidate who has already used violence as a political tool means the department’s dilemma is among the most fateful in American history.\n\nMore broadly, the committee has now sketched the most urgent framing of a perennial question about Trump’s riotous careers in business and politics: Will he ever face accountability for his rule-breaking conduct?\n\nThe question is especially acute given that the norm crushed this time almost toppled US democracy.\n\nRead the full analysis here.\n\nFor months, the Jan. 6 committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. On Monday, the committee didn’t equivocate.\n\nThe committee referred Trump to the DOJ on at least four criminal charges, including:\n\nObstructing an official proceeding\n\nDefrauding the United States\n\nMaking false statements\n\nAssisting or aiding an insurrection\n\nThe panel said in its executive summary that it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nSo what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nIn practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nBut the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department’s court.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said during Monday’s meeting that he has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nAfter the panel’s meeting, Thompson told CNN that the evidence that supports the panel’s decision to refer Trump to the DOJ is “clear,” adding that he is “convinced” that the department will ultimately charge Trump.\n\nCNN’s Tierney Sneed contributed reporting to this post.\n\nOn Monday, the January 6 committee released an executive summary of its report, and it plans to release the full report on Wednesday, as well as transcripts of committee interviews.\n\nHere are takeaways from the committee’s final public meeting:\n\nCommittee refers Trump to DOJ. The committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nAll roads lead to Trump. Committee members repeatedly pointed to Trump’s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on January 6. Monday’s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break “the foundation of American democracy.”\n\nCommittee uses video to illustrate case. The committee showed a video montage laying out all of its allegations against Trump, from witnesses saying that Trump was told he lost the election by his aides to the former president’s failure to act on January 6 as the violence at the Capitol was unfolding. The montage went step-by-step through Trump’s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters.\n\nA bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois described how his House GOP colleagues were complicit in Trump’s efforts to overturn the election. He highlighted evidence that Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to “put the facade of legitimacy” on his voter fraud claims so “Republican congressmen … can distort and destroy and create doubt” about the 2020 election results.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has concluded that former President Donald Trump was ultimately responsible for the insurrection, laying out for the public and the Justice Department a trove of evidence for why he should be prosecuted for multiple crimes.\n\nThe summary describes in extensive detail how Trump tried to overpower, pressure and cajole anyone who wasn’t willing to help him overturn his election defeat — while knowing that many of his schemes were unlawful. His relentless arm-twisting included election administrators in key states, senior Justice Department leaders, state lawmakers, and others. The report even suggests possible witness tampering with the committee’s investigation.\n\nThe full report, based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation by the nine-member bipartisan committee, will be released Wednesday, along with along with transcripts and other materials collected in the investigation.\n\nHere are some key things from the report summary:\n\nCommittee referring Trump and others to DOJ: The House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Trump attorney John Eastman and “others.” The report summary says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nTrump’s false victory was “premeditated”: The committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\nTrump’s belief that the election is stolen is no excuse, lawmakers say: Sources familiar with Trump’s legal strategy in the Justice Department probe have told CNN that his attorneys believe prosecutors face an uphill battle in proving he did not believe the election was stolen despite being told as much by senior members of his own administration.\n\nIn making its case for a Justice Department prosecution of Trump, the House committee took aim at that possible defense.\n\nSeveral members of Congress being referred to House Ethics Committee: The select committee is referring several Republican lawmakers who refused to cooperate with the investigation to the House Ethics Committee. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona, could all face possible sanctions for their refusal to comply with committee subpoenas.\n\nTrump and others may try this again, committee warns: The summary’s section outlining the referrals makes a case for why the Justice Department’s prosecutions should extend beyond the rioters who physically breached the Capitol.\n\nThe committee says that Trump “believed then, and continues to believe now, that he is above the law, not bound by our Constitution and its explicit checks on Presidential authority.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/january-6-committee-report-executive-summary-key-findings-trump/', 'Headline': 'The 17 key findings from the executive summary of the Jan. 6 committee ...', 'Snippet': 'Jan. 6 panel calls for charges against Trump . ...

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January. McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt.""'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/29/politics/january-6-committee-transcripts/index.html', 'Headline': 'Key findings from the latest Jan. 6 panel transcripts, including from ...', 'Snippet': 'The House January 6 committee on Thursday released a new batch of transcripts, including interviews with Donald Trump Jr., former Trump White House aides and others.', 'Full_text': 'The House January 6 committee on Thursday released a new batch of transcripts, including interviews with Donald Trump Jr., former Trump White House aides and others.\n\nThe latest transcripts covered a range of topics and revealed new details from the January 6 committee’s investigation, including the former president’s son explaining a text message to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the 2020 election, insights into former first lady Melania Trump’s distrust of people in her husband’s inner circle and some of the chaos surrounding the law enforcement response to the rioters breaching the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nThis new batch is part of a steady stream of transcript drops that the select committee has put out over the past week, complementing its sweeping 845-page report. The latest release comes as the panel winds down its work with the House majority set to change hands from Democrats to Republicans next week at the start of the new Congress.\n\nSo far, the released transcripts have provided illuminating insights into the final weeks of former President Donald Trump’s presidency, with accounts from inside the Trump White House, from federal and state officials who resisted pressure to overturn the 2020 election results, and many others.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from Thursday’s disclosures:\n\nDonald Trump Jr. explains why he texted Meadows on November 5 about plans to keep his father in office\n\nDonald Trump Jr. told the committee that the reason he texted Meadows a detailed plan about how to ensure his father would get a second term two days after the 2020 presidential election was because he thought the ideas were “the most sophisticated” and “sounded plausible.”\n\nTrump Jr.’s testimony, revealed by the select committee on Thursday, provides new context to a text message CNN first reported on in April where he lays out various ideas for keeping Trump in power by subverting the Electoral College process.\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake “Trump electors.”\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6, 2021.\n\n“We have operational control Total leverage,” the message reads. “Moral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.”\n\nAlthough Trump Jr. said that he was not the original author of the text, a point his lawyer made to CNN back in April, and that he did not remember who the original author of the message was, he explained to investigators why out of all the messages he was being sent at the time, he felt this one was necessary to pass on to Meadows.\n\n“Perhaps in reading it, it was the most sophisticated, you know, and detailed, and again, about things I don’t necessarily, you know, know too much about, but it sounded plausible and I wanted to make sure that we were looking into the issues brought up in the text,” Trump Jr. said.\n\nMeadows did not initially respond to the original November 5 text, but when Trump Jr. followed up the next day to make sure he saw, Trump’s then-chief of staff texted, “much of this had merit. Working on this for PA, so Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina already.”\n\nDonald Trump Jr., fiancée don’t recall details and distance themselves from events that led to January 6, transcripts show\n\nDonald Trump Jr. told the committee he couldn’t recall key details related to his appearance at a rally that preceded the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nTrump Jr. said he didn’t know Turning Point Action paid him and his fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle $30,000 each for their appearances at the rally on the White House ellipse. He said he thought the money was for an event at the Palm Beach Hilton in December, according to a transcript released Thursday.\n\n“My recollection was that we had spoken for them prior to Christmas at an event that we did annually and always got sort of paid for speaking fees to show up,” Trump Jr. said.\n\nIn transcripts of their interviews with the House select committee, Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle repeatedly said they didn’t recall details and distanced themselves from the events that led to the January 6 attack. Trump Jr. told committee investigators, “I don’t recall specifically,” when asked if he ever received the $30,000 and “I don’t know,” when asked if Guilfoyle ever ended up getting paid.\n\nThroughout their testimony, Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle said they didn’t remember specific conversations about rally planning and that they were in the dark about the particulars as it was being put together.\n\nGuilfoyle also denied having conversations with anyone linking the rally to objections to Congress certifying Joe Biden’s electoral win.\n\n“I was not involved in any of that certification stuff. I couldn’t explain it to you to this day,” she said, adding that she didn’t know the significance of holding the rally on January 6.\n\n‘Just give me five dead voters’: Sen. Lindsey Graham said after 2020 election, Trump lawyer tells committee\n\nAfter the 2020 election, Sen. Lindsey Graham pledged to become a “champion” of then-President Trump’s election fraud claims – if only Trump’s advisers would give him information about dead voters, according to an account given to the January 6 committee.\n\n“Senator Graham was saying, ‘Get me your information,’” Trump lawyer Christina Bobb relayed to the committee about what Graham said in a meeting days before the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\n“Just give me five dead voters,” Bobb said Graham told then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and others in Meadows’ office at the White House.\n\n“Give me, you know, an example of illegals voting. Just give me a very small snapshot that I can take and champion,” Bobb added, relaying what Graham said at the time.\n\nThe exchange with Graham highlights how the South Carolina Republican became involved in Trump’s pressure campaign to overturn his election loss in Georgia, and how the White House at the time was connecting with influential politicians to advance Trump’s message of false election fraud claims.\n\n“Graham was like, ‘Oh, I’d love to support the cause. I think it would be great to, you know, really show all the fraud. Send me a memo and show me, you know, what information you have got. I’ll champion it,’” Bobb also recalled from the conversation with Graham.\n\nAccording to a transcript of Bobb’s House testimony released Thursday, Graham received a memo from the legal team working with Trump, titled “Chairman Graham dead votes memo for your consideration.”\n\nBut Bobb added: “He did nothing with it.”\n\nGraham’s office pointed out on Thursday that the book “Peril” by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa previously described a similar exchange between Graham and the Trump advisers. After receiving their memo, the senator was unconvinced of the fraud they claimed, the book said. His office didn’t provide any further response.\n\nGrisham says she learned Trump thought rioters ‘looked very trashy’ but loved that they were ‘fighting for him’\n\nStephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary and chief of staff to Melania Trump, said she learned from people inside the West Wing on January 6, 2021, that Trump thought the rioters “looked very trashy,” but reveled in how they were “fighting for him.”\n\nGrisham told the committee: “I heard from several people in the West Wing, more on the military aide or Secret Service side, and then a couple just people, but that he was sitting in the dining room, and he was just watching it all unfold, and that a couple of his comments – some of his comments were that these people looked very trashy, but also look at what fighters they were.”\n\n“He was kind of reveling in the fact that these people were fighting for him. But he also didn’t like how they looked,” Grisham said.\n\nMelania Trump didn’t trust her husband’s inner circle, the former first lady’s chief of staff says\n\nGrisham also detailed the former first lady’s distrust in people close to her husband after the 2020 election, including Donald Trump Jr.\n\n“Certainly when it came to the kids, especially Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, she never trusted that they were doing things in the best interest of their – of Don Jr.’s father,” Grisham told the committee.\n\nGrisham said Melania also distrusted “people that she thought were giving her husband bad advice,” like lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani and campaign staffers. “She would say, I think they’re giving him bad advice, I don’t think this is smart.”\n\nFormer Trump acting defense secretary endorsed giving DC mayor more control of DC National Guard\n\nChris Miller, who served as acting defense secretary at the end of the Trump administration, told the committee he thought the Washington, DC, mayor should have greater control of the DC National Guard in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nMiller was asked in his January deposition about a proposal in Congress to give the Washington, DC, mayor the same authority to deploy the National Guard that a governor has. Because the District of Columbia is not a state, the authority to deploy is delegated to the Army secretary by the defense secretary and president.\n\nMiller said of the DC mayor being given more authority over the Guard: “Being a private citizen, I’ll tell you exactly what I think, and take it or leave. Heck, yeah.”\n\n“The mayor should absolutely have greater control over the DC National Guard,” he continued, according to a transcript released by the panel Thursday. “I do not know the history. And I’m sure there’s all sorts of reasons that are constitutional, way beyond what I understand, so I’m just kind of popping off, but there’s got to be a way to integrate her or the mayor into this process of work meaningfully and more proactively.”\n\nMiller testified to the committee about the lag in getting National Guard soldiers to the Capitol on January 6, saying that he didn’t know why Major Gen. William Walker, the DC National Guard Commander, believed he didn’t have approval to deploy. According to the January 6 committee’s report, Walker “understood he had to wait for approval from Secretary (Ryan) McCarthy to deploy his forces. But as he waited on that video call for hours, he did strongly consider sending them anyway.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/jan-6-committee-public-meeting/index.html', 'Headline': 'Live updates: Jan. 6 committee votes to issue criminal referrals ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The Jan. 6 committee voted to approve its final report and the referral of multiple criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ during the panel’s final public meeting Monday.', 'Full_text': 'These are the key takeaways from the Jan. 6 committee\'s final public session\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee used its final public meeting Monday to summarize its 17-month investigation with a simple closing statement: All roads lead to Donald Trump.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\n\nThe committee refers Trump to the DOJ\n\nFor months, the committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. On Monday, the committee didn’t equivocate.\n\nThe committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary, released after the meeting, it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nIn practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nBut the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department’s court.\n\nAll roads lead to Trump\n\nCommittee members repeatedly pointed to Trump’s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6.\n\nMonday’s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break “the foundation of American democracy.” Members stressed that Trump knew the election was not stolen but continued to push baseless claims about widespread voter fraud in an effort to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory.\n\nVisually reinforcing their argument\n\nThe committee relied once again on video — an effective and memorable tool the panel has used throughout its hearings with closed-door witness testimony and harrowing scenes from the violent attack on the Capitol, to make an its case against Trump.\n\nThe montage went step-by-step through Trump’s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters.\n\nA bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor\n\nThough GOP lawmakers have called the committee partisan, the panel is, in fact, bipartisan.\n\nTwo Republicans who volunteered to join the committee: Rep. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. They both brought GOP staff members along with them who worked for the committee.\n\nTo be sure, Cheney and Kinzinger are outliers in their caucus because they are anti-Trump. And that is the core of Trump’s critiques of the committee — that it stacked with Trump haters. Still, even if they oppose Trump, Cheney and Kinzinger are still deeply conservative Republicans.\n\nNo matter what Trump and his allies say, Democrats will forever be able to accurately assert that the panel’s findings, conclusions, its final report and its criminal referrals are bipartisan.\n\nRead more takeaways here\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee had its last public meeting today. Here\'s what happens next.\n\nThe end is near — at least for the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nThe panel held its final public session Monday where it voted on its final report and approved a criminal referral for several charges against former President Donald Trump.\n\nSo here’s what happens next: Committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the full report will come out Wednesday. This will be a historical document that will be studied for generations — never before has a sitting president tried to steal a second term.\n\nAdditional “transcripts and documents” will be released before the end of the year, Thompson said.\n\nThe sheer volume of this material can’t be overstated. The panel interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, likely generating tens of thousands of pages of transcripts. Many of these interviews were filmed, which means the panel has hundreds of hours of footage that it might release very soon.\n\nThese upcoming releases will provide fodder to Trump’s critics. But it will also grant a key demand from some of Trump’s allies — that the panel disclose the full context of its interviews. Up until this point, the panel has been very selective about which snippets of witness interviews got played at public hearings.\n\nThe current Congress ends on January 3, 2023, and that’s when the committee will cease to exist. But the Justice Department investigation, overseen by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by US Attorney General Merrick Garland, continues.\n\nOf the committee’s nine members, four won’t be returning to Congress. Besides Republican vice-chair Rep. Liz Cheney and Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida is retiring, and Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia was one of the handful of House Democratic incumbents who lost their seats in the 2022 midterms last month.\n\n""We ended up in the middle"": Rep. Jamie Raskin explains how the committee made criminal referral selections\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who serves on the subcommittee of the Jan. 6 select committee responsible for presenting criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, laid out how panel members arrived at the decisions presented during Monday’s final public session.\n\nAsked about process offenses, such as witness tampering or perjury, Raskin said “as evidence is assembled about that, I hope that those will be charged as well. You cannot suborn perjury, you cannot obstruct justice, you cannot interfere with a congressional proceeding.” However, Raskin did not specify who these potential charges related to in the panel’s investigation.\n\nIn terms of unanswered questions left by the committee, Raskin was asked if the panel ever solved the situation with the pipe bombs on Jan. 6 and said, “I don’t believe there have been any updates since we first looked int to. Those are unsolved crimes.”\n\nIn pictures: Scenes from the last public Jan. 6 committee meeting\n\nCheck out photos from the last Jan. 6 hearings here.\n\nCommittee members Schiff and Raskin explain why more Trump associates were not referred to the DOJ\n\nJan. 6 committee members, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Adam Schiff, explained that more associates of former President Donald Trump were not directly referred to the Department of Justice because the committee wanted to focus on those with “abundant evidence” against them.\n\nRaskin noted that the DOJ will receive the full report and can decide if anyone else discussed merits further investigation.\n\n“We wanted to proceed in such a way that we could all feel certain that these were people where evidence exists that they engaged in criminal offenses against our country,” he added.\n\nSchiff said, “The long and the short of it is we possess evidence that up until this release, the Justice Department may not have, they possess evidence that we don’t have, and the cumulative impact of all that evidence will hopefully lead to justice for those that have broken the law here.”\n\nRaskin promised that they would cooperate with the Justice Department “quickly,” while Schiff added that the committee expects evidence will start to be made available to both the DOJ and the public starting Wednesday.\n\nAsked to explain why those four House Republicans were referred to House Ethics in particular, Schiff pointed out that these four failed to comply with a congressional subpoena, which is easier to prove.\n\nHere\'s a recap of what happened at the Jan. 6 committee\'s final public session\n\nAfter extensive investigation, the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol held its final public meeting Monday where they voted on their final report and approved a series of criminal referrals — including against former President Donald Trump and others in his orbit.\n\nThe final report is expected to be released publicly Wednesday.\n\nHere are the key things that happened at the committee’s last public session:\n\nTrump’s role in the events of Jan. 6: The committee announced it will refer several criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including obstructing an official proceeding, defrauding the United States, making false statements and assisting or aiding an insurrection.The DOJ special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into Jan. 6. The referrals are largely symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes.\n\nFinal report: Members voted to approve their final report, which will include a bulk of results from the 17-month investigation, chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said during his opening remarks. An executive summary of the report was released after Monday’s meeting, but the full report won’t be available to the public until Wednesday.\n\nA spanning investigation: During the meeting, the committee played a video summarizing its investigation. Since its formation in July 2021, the panel conducted more than 1,000 interviews as well as issued subpoenas and court battles to obtain hundreds of thousands of documents. The committee said the evidence shows that Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nClosing remarks from the committee: Though its investigation is coming to a close, Thompson reiterated the importance of preventing another insurrection from happening again, for the sake of American democracy. “I believe nearly two years later, this is still a time of reflection and reckoning,” he said. “If we are to survive as a nation of laws and democracy, this can never happen again.” Thompson said the most important thing in preventing another event like Jan. 6 is accountability. The committee’s vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, said Trump was “unfit for any office.”\n\nOfficers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 were sitting in the front row during committee meeting\n\nAs the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 riot held its last public meeting, the room was packed.\n\nLaw enforcement officers who testified at the panel’s first public hearing last July about the violence they experienced defending the US Capitol on Jan. 6 sat in the front row, as they have for every public event the committee has had.\n\nThose officers include: US Capitol Police (USCP) officer Harry Dunn, former Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, former USCP Sgt. Aquilino Gonell and Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges.\n\nFanone sat in the audience as the panel replayed his testimony about being attacked as the riot unfolded.\n\nA number of committee staff and investigators — and even former GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, who has publicly supported the panel’s work — were in the audience as well.\n\nThe meeting took place in the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caucus Room which was recently renamed to honor House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who stepping down as speaker at the end of the this Congress.\n\nIn previous hearings, it was typical to see a committee staffer sitting at the dais with the members. But for today’s meeting, it was just the nine committee members at the dais, each taking turns speaking.\n\nJan. 6 committee chair says he\'s ""convinced"" Trump will be charged by DOJ with help of panel\'s evidence\n\nJan. 6 committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the evidence that supports the panel’s decision to refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for several criminal charges is “clear,” adding that he is “convinced” that the DOJ will ultimately charge Trump.\n\n“The committee looked at it long and hard, and from my vantage point, we couldn’t do anything except make the referral,” Thompson told CNN after Monday’s meeting, acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the referral.\n\n“It was clear in the evaluation of the evidence uncovered by our committee that those actions taken by the president… former President Trump, clearly created a problem for this country,” he added.\n\nThe committee also voted to approve its final report which will be released to the public Wednesday. That report will contain most of the evidence from the 17-month long investigation — including full transcripts from more than 1,000 interviews.\n\n“We think it’s important for the Justice Department to look at that body of information that we put together,” he said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n1c447b21-7492-487d-bf20-bbd9f8559559.mp4\n\n01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nKellyanne Conway testified that Trump described rioters as ""upset"" the day after the attack\n\nTrump “minimized the seriousness of the attack” in the days following the riot, Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Elaine Luria said, specifically citing testimony that Trump’s former senior adviser Kellyanne Conway gave to the committee.\n\nAsked to describe her conversation with Trump the day after the riot, Conway, said she didn’t think it was very long. “I don’t think it was very long. I just said that was just a terrible day.”\n\nTrump, Conway said, responded to her saying, “These people are upset. They’re very upset.”\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump similarly described rioters as being “upset” during a heated phone call he had with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy while the insurrection was underway, claiming the rioters cared more about the election results than the California Republican did.\n\n“Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,” Trump said, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call afterward by McCarthy.\n\nTrump’s comment set off what GOP lawmakers familiar with the call described as a shouting match between the two men. A furious McCarthy told Trump the rioters were breaking into his office through the windows, and asked, “Who the f–k do you think you are talking to?” according to a Republican lawmaker familiar with the call.\n\nTrump was warned of violence before Jan. 6, but refused to encourage peaceful protest\n\nIn the lead up to Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Donald Trump ignored warnings from advisors about the potential for violence and rejected any suggestion that he should explicitly tell supporters to be peaceful, Rep. Stephanie Murphy said Monday.\n\nMurphy pointed to a text message exchange provided to the committee by Hope Hicks, Trump’s former communications director. In the exchange, Hicks and then White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley discussed getting Trump to tweet out a message to his supporters. Gidley texted Hicks that Trump “really should tweet something about Being NON-violent.”\n\nHicks responded that she had already “suggested it several times” without success.\n\n“Mr. Herschmann said that he had made the same recommendation directly to the President and that he had refused,” Hicks said in her interview with the committee, a video of which was played Monday.\n\nDespite his staff’s warnings, Murphy said, Trump took to the stage on Jan. 6, 2021, and encouraged his supporters to “fight like hell,” and sent them marching to the Capitol building.\n\nNOW: Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral against Trump and other officials\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral it plans to make against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department and other officials.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee would refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the committee, told CNN last week that a subcommittee of members would make recommendations to the full committee about various referrals.\n\nThe full committee is now expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nRemember: A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case. With the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nJan. 6 committee concerned lawyer took part in attempt to keep truth from them, Lofgren says\n\nHouse Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren revealed during Monday’s public meeting that an unnamed lawyer appeared to have attempted to shape the testimony of one witness in a way that could help Donald Trump.\n\nLofgren noted a lawyer suggested that the witness not share some memories during her testimony to the committee, that she couldn’t learn who was paying for her lawyer, and that Trump-allied entities offered to keep her under their wing as her testimony neared.\n\nAs it became clear what the witness would say, Lofgren added, the job offers evaporated.\n\nLofgren didn’t name the lawyer or the female witness, and it’s not clear if all of the examples are about one witness.\n\nIt’s not unusual or illegal for lawyers to take money from motivated backers to pay for witnesses to be represented. But lawyers must follow strict ethics guidelines, governed by their state bars and enforced by the courts. The House select committee previously shared their concerns about potential witness influence with the Justice Department.\n\nFormer Trump aide Hope Hicks describes conversation with Trump saying the only thing that matters is winning\n\nIn a new video clip played by the House Jan. 6 committee, Hope Hicks, who previously served as a top aide to former President Donald Trump, referenced the baseless claims of election fraud and said: “I was becoming increasingly concerned that … we were damaging his legacy.”\n\nTrump “said something along the lines of, you know, ‘Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,’” Hicks said in the clip.\n\nThe committee played the clip after Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren said Trump was repeatedly told there was no evidence to back up his false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, and the panel “has obtained testimony from new witnesses who have come forward to tell us about their conversations with ex-President Trump on this topic.”\n\n“Donald Trump knowingly and corruptly repeated election fraud lies, which incited his supporters to violence on Jan. 6. He continues to repeat his meritless claim that the election was stolen even today, and continues to erode our most cherished and shared belief in free and fair elections,” Lofgren later continued.\n\nKinzinger calls out fellow Republicans for their role in Trump’s DOJ schemes\n\nGOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the two Republicans on the the Jan. 6 committee, accused former president Donald Trump of trying to abuse the powers of the Justice Department so he could stay in office.\n\nKinzinger described how Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to publicly endorse his false claims about massive voter fraud. As part of the plan, Trump wanted them to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,” according to committee testimony.\n\nA retiring Republican, Kinzinger called out his fellow GOP lawmakers. He also specifically name-dropped Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, who was involved with some of Trump’s scheming at the Justice Department.\n\nWhen then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to go along with Trump’s plan, Trump almost fired him and replaced him with Jeffrey Clark, a Trump loyalist at DOJ who embraced his election lies.\n\n“It was only after the threat of mass resignations that President Trump rescinded his offer to Mr. Clark,” Kinzinger said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\ncc4283b8-e6ad-44ea-8cac-93d9dcbf8029.mp4\n\n04:42 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump ""oversaw"" legally dubious fake electors plot, Jan. 6 committee says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump “oversaw” an effort to obtain and transmit false Electoral College certificates, tying him directly to a core tenet of the broader plot to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory in key swing states, the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection said Monday.\n\nThe panel highlighted Trump’s personal involvement in the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost, arguing that the evidence shows he actively worked to “transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives.”\n\nThose certificates, which surfaced publicly earlier this year, helped spark criminal investigations into the Trump team’s attempt to subvert the Electoral College.\n\nAs part of its closing message Monday, the select committee emphasized that these “false ballots” were created despite concerns among Trump’s election lawyers and White House counsel that doing so may be “unlawful.”\n\n“In spite of these concerns, and the concerns of individuals in the White House Counsel’s Office, President Trump and others proceeded with this plan,” he added.\n\nThe committee has evidence that shows these “intentionally false” Electoral College certificates were “transmitted to multiple officers of the federal government,” according to Schiff.\n\nEvidence collected by the committee also shows these documents “were intended to interfere with the proper conduct of the joint session, where the existence of so-called ‘competing slates’ of electors would serve as a pretext for legitimate electoral votes to be rejected,” he added.\n\nCheney: Trump ""is unfit for any office""\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the committee, issued a scathing rebuke of former President Donald Trump during her opening remarks on Monday, saying he is unfit for office based on his actions regarding Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\n“At the beginning of our investigation, we understood that tens of millions of Americans had been persuaded by President Trump that the 2020 election was stolen by overwhelming fraud. And we also knew this was flatly false. We knew that dozens of state and federal judges had addressed and resolved all manner of allegations about the election,” Cheney said. “Our legal system functioned as it should. But our president would not accept the outcome. Among the most shameful of this committee’s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television.”\n\nShe went on to describe how Trump was unmoved by “urgent pleas” from people around him to “issue a public statement instructing his supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol,” even as rioters attacked law enforcement officials and halted the electoral count.\n\n“In addition to being unlawful as described in our report, this was an utter moral failure, and a clear dereliction of duty,” Cheney added.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney: ""At the heart of our Republic is the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power""\n\nGOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection on the US Capitol, said the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power is “at the heart of our Republic.”\n\nShe added: “Trumbull called this ‘one of the highest moral lessons ever given the world.’ With this noble act, George Washington established the indispensable example of the peace transfer of power in our nation.”\n\nShe traced this orderly transfer of power through every president of the United States until former President Donald Trump refused his constitutional duty.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nfb900dba-c57b-4545-9654-1fd8f5848d90.mp4\n\n05:07 - Source: CNN\n\nThompson: It\'s up to the people of America to decide who deserves the public\'s trust\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said that the future of democracy rests on the hands of the American public during his opening statement at Monday’s public meeting.\n\nHe also thanked the American public for tuning into the committee’s hearings and said that he hoped that the evidence presented lived up to their expectations.\n\n“I’m grateful to the millions of you who followed this committee’s work. I hope we lived up to our commitment to present the facts — and let the facts speak for themselves,” Thompson said.\n\nHe continued, “Let me say in closing, the women and men seated around me on this dais are public servants in the most genuine sense. They put aside politician and partisanship, to ensure the success of this committee, and providing answers to the American people.”\n\nThompson specifically thanked Republican Rep. Liz Cheney for her participation. “I especially want to thank and acknowledge our vice chair, who has become a true partner in this bipartisan effort, Ms. Cheney of Wyoming.”\n\nAmerica is still in a time of ""reflection and reckoning"" nearly 2 years after Jan. 6, chairman says\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said the panel’s findings show that former President Donald Trump was responsible for the insurrection at the US Capitol and that there is still “reckoning” left to do, nearly two years later.\n\n“We remain in strange and uncharted waters,” Thompson said, as the committee comes to the close.\n\nIn opening statements to the committee’s final public session, Thompson said Americans show faith in elected officials that they will abide by laws and uphold elected results.\n\n“If the faith is broken, so is our democracy,” he said. “Donald Trump broke that faith. He lost the 2020 election and knew it, but he chose to try to stay in office through a multi-part scheme to overturn the results and block the transfer of power.”\n\n“In the end, he summoned a mob to Washington,” he said, adding that their findings show Trump knew they were “armed and angry.”\n\nThompson said the committee intends to make the bulk of its results public in the form of its final report, expected to be released Wednesday.\n\nAlong with adopting its final report on Monday, the committee is also expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, CNN previously reported.\n\n“So, today, beyond our findings, we will also show that evidence we’ve gathered points to further action beyond the power of this committee, or the Congress, to help ensure accountability under law,” he added.\n\n“Accountability that can only be found in the criminal justice system. We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a roadmap to justice,” he said.\n\nThompson didn’t announce the criminal referrals in his opening statement but said that the panel has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nCNN’s Jeremy Herb contributed reporting to this post.\n\nNOW: The Jan. 6 committee has started its final public meeting\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has begun its final public meeting.\n\nThe panel is expected to announce criminal referrals to the Justice Department and Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, has said the panel will approve its final report at the meeting. It won’t be made public until Wednesday. Members of the committee have promised to release the report before the end of the year since Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nThe meeting — which, unlike previous gatherings of the committee, is not a hearing with witnesses — will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals, Thompson said last week.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies.\n\nThe committee has been investigating the events on and leading up to the insurrection since the panel was formed in July 2021.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee’s final public session is starting soon. Here are key things to watch for.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, will soon hold its last public meeting, marking the end of an expansive investigation that has spanned more than 17 months, encompassed more than 1,000 interviews and culminated in accusations that former President Donald Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nThrough blockbuster hearings, interviews with some of the former president’s closest allies and court battles to free up documents, the committee sought to tell the definitive narrative of what happened in the lead up to and on Jan. 6.\n\nOn Monday, members are expected to vote on its final report – spanning hundreds of pages and encapsulating its key findings, which will be released to the public on Wednesday – as well as present criminal referrals it plans to make to the Justice Department. This meeting will be the panel’s last message to the public, and members are seeking to end on a powerful note.\n\nThe charges the panel is considering asking DOJ to pursue include multiple against Trump, such as obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe recommendations match the allegations the House select committee made against Trump and his elections attorney John Eastman in a previous court proceeding seeking Eastman’s emails.\n\nThe final House report could include additional charges proposed for Trump, according to the source. It will provide justification from the committee investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nThe panel is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to Trump, CNN has reported: former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Eastman, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who leads the Jan. 6 subcommittee tasked with presenting recommendations on criminal referrals to the full panel, recently said that “the gravest offense in constitutional terms is the attempt to overthrow a presidential election and bypass the constitutional order. Subsidiary to all of that are a whole host of statutory offenses, which support the gravity and magnitude of that violent assault on America.”\n\nRaskin, along with Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, both of California, and the panel’s vice chair, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, comprised the subcommittee tasked with providing the full panel with referral recommendations that will be adopted on Monday.\n\nTrump\'s team braces for criminal referrals while he lashes out on social media, sources say\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s team huddled together multiple times since they learned the committee would be issuing criminal referrals — attempting to prepare for what they believed going to happen —a criminal referral from the House Select Committee to the Department of Justice.\n\nSources close to Trump said much of his inner circle were not ignoring the committee’s actions, despite many around the former president brushing it off as political.\n\nMany of his top advisers spent time on the phone with legal counsel, trying to get a deeper understanding of what exactly criminal referrals would mean and how to plan a response.\n\nWhile some aides said Trump was unbothered by the committee, the former president spent the weekend fixated on their actions.\n\nIn a flurry of social media posts on Truth Social, Trump called the committee names, accused them of “illegally leaking confidential info” and hitting individuals sitting on the committee.\n\nHe also posted copies of tweets from the afternoon on Jan. 6, calling for protestors to be “peaceful.” During the Jan. 6 hearings, former White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews testified that she was told Trump did not want to include any mention of “peace” in his tweets, but ultimately gave in to White House officials and advisers urged the former president to do more as the violent attack was unfolding.\n\nThe criminal referrals are just the latest in a long line of legal battles Trump is facing as he ramps up his third presidential campaign.\n\nToday\'s committee meeting is expected to have a ""simple and sober"" tone\n\nAs the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection lays out its evidence and criminal referrals today, lawmakers are expected to hit a sober tone, sources say.\n\nToday’s meeting is expected to be relatively brief with some multimedia presentations.\n\nUnlike previous hearings that relied on compelling witness testimony and splashy video montages, today’s event is designed to drive home the key evidence the committee uncovered and the gravity of what transpired in the run up and on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Nobody’s spiking the football here,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat and Jan. 6 committee member, told CNN just ahead of the committee meeting.\n\nJan. 6 committee treating release of executive summary and today\'s meeting as a roadmap for DOJ, sources say\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is treating today’s public meeting and the release of its executive summary as a “roadmap” for the Department of Justice, sources tell CNN.\n\nThe committee intends to lay out its body of evidence and drive home its conclusion that former President Donald Trump was culpable for the events that transpired on Jan. 6, 2021 — the basis for its plans to refer Trump to DOJ on at least three criminal charges.\n\nLawmakers are primarily focused on laying out their case for DOJ, but their wide-ranging investigation has uncovered information that congressional investigators believe could be relevant to various bodies — from state bars to the House ethics committee.\n\nCongressional investigators have already provided what they believe is evidence of criminal activity to an Atlanta-area district attorney leading a criminal investigation into Trump and his allies, according to someone familiar with the investigation.\n\nTrump legal team mired in disagreements as he faces criminal referral\n\nAs the Jan. 6 committee is expected to issue a criminal referral for former President Donald Trump, his legal team has continued to be bogged down in internal disagreements about the many probes facing him.\n\nTrump’s team has met to talk about what to expect from the committee today, but they are much more focused and concerned with the other investigations facing him, including the federal grand jury on Jan. 6, the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation and the special grand jury in Georgia, multiple people familiar with the workings of the team say.\n\nDespite the many probes facing Trump, his team is not acting as a unified front, but has often been locked in serious disagreement over how to proceed on several of the investigations, mainly when it comes to the documents one.\n\nOne thing Trump’s advisers will watch for today is how deep the referrals from the committee go and whether it mentions obstruction of the investigation when it pertains to Trump.\n\nTrump advisers and aides will be watching the meeting today closely, however sources close to Trump said the former President has told them he does not plan on watching.\n\nHowever, he will be updated by people around him, as he has been for all of the public hearings thus far.\n\nAs of now, Trump’s legal team will not be engaging in the response to the committee today, however sources stress that this could change as the public meeting unfolds.\n\nThese are the crimes the Jan. 6 committee is said to be considering for a Trump referral\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is eyeing multiple alleged crimes for a referral of former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, CNN reported last week.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the matter, they include:\n\nInsurrection\n\nObstruction of an official proceeding\n\nConspiracy to defraud the federal government\n\nFor the latter two, the lawmakers can rely on an opinion from a federal judge in California, who wrote earlier this year that there was evidence that Trump and his allies were plotting to defraud the US government and to obstruct an official proceeding. The opinion was handed down by US District Judge David O. Carter in a dispute over whether the House could access certain emails sent to and from former Trump attorney John Eastman.\n\nThe judge cited emails discussing Trump’s awareness that certain voter fraud claims being made in court were inaccurate as evidence of a plot to defraud the federal government. To explain his finding of evidence of obstruction, the judge pointed to emails that showed that the Trump team was contemplating filing lawsuits not to obtain legitimate legal relief, but to meddle in congressional proceedings.\n\nA House referral for an insurrection charge would be a more aggressive move. It’s a crime to assist or engage in “in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws.” Judges have used the term “insurrection” to describe the January 6 attack on Congress’ certification of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut the Justice Department has not opted to bring the charge in its hundreds of US Capitol riot cases. Instead, prosecutors have relied on criminal statutes related to violence, obstruction of an official proceeding, and, in some limited cases, seditious conspiracy.\n\nWho else could be referred? The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies including, Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, multiple sources told CNN earlier this month.\n\nAnother source cautioned at the time that while names were being considered, there was still discussion to be had before they were finalized.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nRep. Schiff: Jan. 6 committee considering how to handle uncooperative GOP lawmakers\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, said Sunday the panel is considering how to hold accountable the GOP lawmakers who defied their subpoenas.\n\nSchiff said the committee would be considering this on Monday, noting that the panel has weighed whether it is better to criminally refer members of Congress to other parts of the federal government or if Congress should “police its own.” Such congressional mechanisms could include censure and referrals to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nFive House Republicans have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 panel: GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe select committee is set to hold its final public hearing today and release its full report on Wednesday. The panel is expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe impact House referrals could have remains unclear because the Department of Justice special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut in addition to criminal referrals, Jan. 6 committee Chairman Bennie Thompson told reporters that the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\n“Censure was something that we have considered. Ethics referrals is something we have considered,” Schiff said Sunday, noting that the committee will disclose its decision Monday.\n\nCNN previously reported that the panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies, including former Trump attorney John Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark and former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to multiple sources.\n\nWhy today\'s Jan. 6 committee session is a meeting and not a hearing\n\nNearly two years removed from the violent attack on the US Capitol, the House select committee tasked with finding out exactly what happened is about to show its hand.\n\nThe panel will hold its final public meeting on Monday, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday.\n\nUnlike previous gatherings of the committee, Monday’s is a business meeting rather than a hearing as no witnesses are set to testify.\n\nWhat to expect from the session: The public meeting, scheduled for 1:00 p.m. ET, is expected to see the panel announce that it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department.\n\nThe committee will release an executive summary of the investigation’s report on Monday after the meeting, a committee aide said Sunday. The final report, to be released two days later, will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nWhy now? Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nA recap of what unfolded in the Jan. 6 committee\'s hearing in October\n\nThe House select committee’s October hearing on the Capitol Hill insurrection used testimony and evidence to demonstrate how former President Donald Trump knew he had lost the election but still went forward with efforts to overturn the results, leading to the attack on the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHere’s a recap of what unfolded at the hearing:\n\nThe committee voted to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony.\n\nPreviously unseen footage aired from the DC-area Army base where congressional leaders took refuge during the insurrection.\n\nElaine Chao, who resigned from her post as Trump’s secretary of Transportation a day after the insurrection, spoke in personal terms about her disgust toward the attack when she testified. “I think the events at the Capitol, however they occurred, were shocking,” she said.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, provided new testimony to the committee relaying anecdotes of Trump acknowledging he had lost the election.\n\nThe panel revealed some of what they had learned from the 1 million Secret Service records obtained within roughly three months since the last January 6 committee hearing.\n\nThe committee revealed new evidence that Trump had devised a plan, well before any votes were counted, to declare victory no matter what the election results were.\n\nCommittee members interviewed Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, last month but ultimately her testimony was not featured as part of the panel’s hearing in October.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHere\'s what the Jan. 6 committee chair said about the referrals the panel will announce Monday\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters last week that the panel will make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department in Monday’s meeting.\n\nWhat this means: Criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack ongoing.\n\nCommittee members see criminal referrals as a critical part of their work, putting their views on the record in order to complete their investigation – not as a way to pressure DOJ, sources have told CNN.\n\nThompson told CNN that the panel is looking at five to six categories of referrals beyond those deemed criminal, but has not decided on the specific number of individuals.\n\nThompson said that in addition to criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, there could be other categories of referrals the committee makes such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nThompson told reporters last Tuesday that Monday’s public meeting will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals.\n\nA subcommittee of members has made recommendations to the full committee about various referrals. During the public meeting, the full committee is expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nCNN reported earlier this month that the committee is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to former President Donald Trump,\n\nA reminder of the key events that unfolded during the Jan. 6 insurrection\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is set to lay out its findings in a final report. When and how the events occurred that day have been a key part of the committee’s probe since the panel formed in July 2021.\n\nSupporters of then-President Trump breached the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, engulfing the building in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to protest against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to certify President Biden’s win.\n\nHere’s how key events unfolded throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump’s speech:\n\nAt 1:10 p.m. ET, while Congress began the process of affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, Trump encouraged his supporters to protest at the US Capitol. Despite promising he would join them, Trump retreated to the White House in his SUV and watched on television as the violence unfolded on Capitol Hill.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. ET, hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers “traitors” for doing their jobs.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Then-Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.\n\nAn armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.\n\nThe Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they had successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they were removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.\n\nThe US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building.\n\nWith about 30 minutes to go before Washington, DC’s 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds. It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.\n\nLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business — namely, confirming Biden’s win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.\n\nProceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence — who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary — bringing the Senate session back into order.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier on the evening of Jan. 6 that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session that night.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the “United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.”\n\nIt took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning (Jan. 7, 2021), but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden’s election win.\n\nSee the full timeline of events here.\n\nWhy the committee is wrapping up its investigation\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters the committee will hold its final public meeting on Monday and that the panel’s full report will come out December 21.\n\nThompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said the committee will approve the panel’s final report on Dec. 19 and make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department, but the public will not see the final report until two days later.\n\n“We will do all of the business of the committee on the 19th,” Thompson said, which includes voting on the final report.\n\nMembers of the committee have promised to have the committee’s report released before the end of the year, as Republicans are expected to dissolve the committee when they take over the chamber in the next Congress.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe other notable investigations Trump faces\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, whose third White House bid has already become mired in controversy, is facing a myriad of legal issues, alongside his business and allies.\n\nAside from the Jan. 6 committee’s probe, here are some other notable investigations involving Trump:\n\nTax returns.The House Ways and Means Committee finally got access to the former president’s tax returns after the Supreme Court dealt a massive defeat to Trump, paving the way for the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the documents to the Democratic-led House. The committee’s chairman, Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sought the tax returns from the IRS in 2019, and the agency, under the Trump administration, initially resisted turning them over.\n\nMar-a-Lago documents. Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed special counsel Jack Smith to oversee the Justice Department criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were brought to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury in Washington has been empaneled and has interviewed potential witnesses to how Trump handled the documents.\n\n2020 Election. The Justice Department has an investigation of its own into the post-2020 election period. While DOJ has not acted publicly during the so-called quiet period leading up to the midterms, a grand jury in Washington has been hearing from witnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is overseeing a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. The probe was launched following Trump’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.\n\nTrump Organization. New York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation, sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\nJames alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.\n\nRead more about other investigations here.\n\nThese are the 9 members on the Jan. 6 committee\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report.\n\nThe committee is made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nChair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California\n\nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California\n\nRepublicans\n\nVice chair: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nHere\'s what a criminal referral is — and what it means for the Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection is set to make announcements at its final public meeting on Monday about criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\nSo what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case.\n\nWith the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nBut whether the department brings charges will depend on whether the facts and the evidence support a prosecution, Attorney General Merrick Garland has said. Garland will make the ultimate call on charging decisions.\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chair of the Jan. 6 committee, has said the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nEx-police officer who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 says he wants to see DOJ indict Trump\n\nMichael Fanone, a former DC police officer and CNN law enforcement analyst, told CNN he would like to see the referrals from the Jan. 6 committee lead to an indictment of former President Donald Trump.\n\nFanone was beaten by rioters during the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.\n\n“I would like to see those individuals put on trial and then again, as I’ve said many times, as Americans we should accept the results of those trials, even if it includes a guilty verdict for former President Donald Trump and jail time,” he said.\n\nFanone also said he is “hopeful” the Justice Department will bring an indictment against Trump.\n\nThe White House is expected to watch quietly as Jan. 6 committee delivers final report this week\n\nWhen the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol delivers its ultimate conclusion to the public this week – holding a final public meeting on Monday and announcing expected criminal referrals to the Justice Department, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday – the White House is expected to watch quietly and decline to offer judgment on any recommendations that the panel may make to the Justice Department.\n\nFor much of the year, top White House officials have made painstaking efforts to avoid delivering specific commentary on the panel’s work. There was one goal in particular of utmost urgency: staying clear of any moves that might suggest that the White House was trying to exert influence on the DOJ.\n\nAnd those efforts are likely to become even more imperative for the Biden White House after the committee refers at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, as a source familiar with the matter said the committee was expected to do this week.\n\nOne White House official told CNN ahead of the committee’s upcoming last meeting on Monday that it would continue to not weigh in on any potential referrals or actions that the panel may take. Another official said this would be in line with the White House’s efforts this year to avoid “running pundit” on the panel’s work.\n\nBut officials also noted that President Biden himself has been clear in his public remarks about the significance of what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, the importance of the committee’s work, not to mention his rejection of last year’s insurrection and the threats to the country’s democratic systems.\n\nIndeed, Biden made that a central theme of his political message in the lead-up to the midterm elections – that decision drew criticism from some fellow Democrats who argued he needed to have a nearly singular focus on the economy, but ultimately left the White House feeling vindicated after Democrats far outperformed expectations.\n\nAnd in the rare moments that Biden did directly comment on the committee, he made clear that he believes the members are doing work critical to documenting history.\n\n“It’s important the American people understand what truly happened and to understand that the same forces that led January 6 remain at work today,” Biden said this summer.\n\nIn October, following a hearing that revealed evidence and testimony from former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchison who said Trump continued efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election even though he knew he had lost reelection, Biden described the testimony and video as “absolutely devastating.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-committee-hearing-trump-day-7-proud-boys-extremists-rcna36733', 'Headline': ""'Call to arms': Jan. 6 panel argues Trump summoned the ... - NBC News"", 'Snippet': '06:07. One witness, Stephen Ayres, who has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after he entered the Capitol on Jan. 6, said he hadn\'t planned to march until Trump called on the crowd at a ""Stop ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — The day after an explosive Oval Office meeting in which a motley crew of outside advisers clashed with White House lawyers over a plan to seize voting machines, then-President Donald Trump turned his focus to riling up his supporters for the Jan. 6 push to stop the counting of electoral votes, according to evidence presented at Tuesday\'s House committee hearing.\n\nTwo longtime Trump advisers, Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, were in contact with leaders of the violent extremist groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, according to text messages and photographs produced by the committee — although Stone, through a lawyer, disputed having participated in a text chain. The two groups began working together for the first time after Trump issued his call for a rally in Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington, the panel said.\n\nOne witness, Stephen Ayres, who has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after he entered the Capitol on Jan. 6, said he hadn\'t planned to march until Trump called on the crowd at a ""Stop the Steal"" rally to march to the Capitol to encourage Republican lawmakers to block certification. Ayres said he went thinking Trump would accompany the mob.\n\n""We basically just followed on what he said,"" Ayres said. ""I think everybody thought he was going to be coming down. ... I believed it.""\n\nThe evidence the committee presented Tuesday is designed to fit into its broader case that Trump resorted to inciting violence after he learned that he had lost the election and had no legal means to prevent a peaceful transfer of power. The panel portrayed the weeks after the November 2020 election as a time of desperation for Trump, during which he considered strategies his own lawyers viewed as detrimental to the nation and his close confidants encouraged the extremist groups that led the attack on the Capitol.\n\nUltimately, siding with White House lawyers against his informal advisers, Trump declined to seize voting machines, even as he insisted publicly — against all evidence — that he was the victim of widespread electoral fraud.\n\nBut he remains engaged in an influence campaign, according to Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the panel\'s top Republican. She said Tuesday that Trump called a witness — whose testimony hasn\'t been made public — after the last hearing.\n\n""That person declined to answer or respond to President Trump’s call and instead alerted their lawyer to the call,"" Cheney said. ""Their lawyer alerted us, and this committee has supplied that information to the Department of Justice.""\n\nCommittee members have repeatedly and publicly warned Trump and his allies not to tamper with witnesses.\n\nThe committee zeroed in on a Dec. 18, 2020, Oval Office meeting, which Flynn attended, arguing that it was a turning point for Trump — the moment when he abandoned pursuing avenues to use his own power to overturn the election and trained his sights on Jan. 6 and the official congressional count of electoral votes.\n\nIt was a wild meeting.\n\n“What they were proposing, I thought, was nuts,” former White House counsel Pat Cipollone said in recorded testimony.\n\nHe described arriving in the Oval Office on Dec. 18 to find outside advisers Sidney Powell, Patrick Byrne and Flynn explaining false theories of voter fraud and a plan for Trump to use an executive order to declare a national emergency, take voting machines from states and remain in office.\n\nThe discussion quickly devolved into a profanity-laced shouting match. Flynn accused Trump\'s White House lawyers of quitting on the president. One of them, Eric Herschmann, testified that he challenged Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and former national security adviser, to come across the room or ""sit your ass down.""\n\nThe sides traded barbs for hours. Trump watched the show. Then, after midnight, the meeting broke up, with Trump\'s White House lawyers having held their line successfully.\n\n“The meeting has been called, quote, ‘unhinged,’ ‘not normal’ and the ‘craziest meeting of the Trump presidency,’” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.\n\nThat was a pivotal moment for Trump, according to the committee, which has produced evidence of the variety of means he pursued to remain in power.\n\nHe pressured Justice Department officials to declare election fraud, state officials to reverse election results, allies in key states to create slates of “fake electors” and Vice President Mike Pence to halt the constitutionally required count of electoral votes in the Capitol, according to witness testimony.\n\nThe committee suggested that the meeting led Trump to light the kindling for Jan. 6.\n\nOn Dec. 19, just hours after the meeting ended, Trump tweeted to his followers that they should come to the nation’s capital.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nThat turned into a “call to action” for some and a “call to arms” for others, said Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., a member of the committee.\n\nSome Trump supporters came to see Jan. 6 as the last chance to stop his ouster by voters — and a moment that begged for violence, according to videos and online posts the committee offered.\n\nThere was at least one reference to a “red wedding” — the scene from the HBO show “Game of Thrones” in which members of a leading family are slaughtered by enemies.\n\n“I’m ready to die for my beliefs,” a person posted on social media in reference to Jan. 6. “Are you ready to die police?”\n\nIn a group chat dubbed “The Ministry of Defense,” Proud Boys and Oath Keepers discussed strategic and tactical plans for Jan. 6, including pinpointing police locations, according to the committee. Kelly Meggs, a leader of the Oath Keepers, directly discussed security with Stone on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, Raskin said.\n\nStone denied helping plan the attack.\n\n“Any claim assertion or implication that I knew in advance about, was involved in or condoned any illegal act at the Capitol on January 6 is categorically false,"" he told NBC News in a text message. ""Nor was I involved in the effort to delay the certification of the Electoral College. I gave a speech on January 5 consistent with my constitutional free-speech rights to skepticism about the anomalies and irregularities in the 2020 election. I am certainly entitled to my apocalyptic view of America’s future as expressed in my speech.”\n\nTrump spoke twice to Steve Bannon, his former White House adviser, on Jan. 5, according to White House phone logs reviewed by the committee. That day, on his podcast, Bannon told listeners that ""all hell is going to break loose tomorrow.""\n\nWith the zero hour approaching, Trump escalated pressure on Pence. In previous hearings, the committee detailed a heated phone conversation in which Trump berated Pence for refusing to stop the certification of electors. At the same time, he was adding references to Pence to his speech for the Stop the Steal rally, according to the panel.\n\nAgainst the recommendation of his lawyers, Trump revised his speech to repeatedly point to Pence as the last man standing between him and the end of his presidency. Committee members have said the references helped incite the crowd to view Pence as a villain. During the storming of the Capitol, the mob got within 40 feet of Pence. Some of the rioters chanted ""Hang Mike Pence.""\n\nThe fiery debate at the White House and the connections between informal Trump advisers and extremists are part of the committee’s effort to demonstrate that Trump, growing increasingly desperate to keep power, would use any means — including violence — to stay in power.\n\nAt times, the committee showed segments of Cipollone\'s testimony to reinforce its conclusion, including one in which he said he believed Trump would eventually give up on trying to reverse the outcome of the election.\n\n“If your question is ‘did I believe he should concede the election at a point in time?’ yes, I did,” Cipollone told the committee in recorded testimony, adding that then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows repeatedly reassured him and then-Attorney General William Barr that Trump would eventually concede.\n\nThe committee has said that the investigation isn’t over and that it now plans to receive testimony later this week from Byrne, a former CEO of Overstock.com who pushed Trump to seize voting machines at the December Oval Office session.\n\nBy the time of that meeting, Barr had already rebuffed Trump.\n\n“The president said something like some people say we could get to the bottom of this if the department seized the machines,” Barr said in recorded testimony.\n\n“I said absolutely not,” Barr recalled. “There’s no probable cause, and I’m not going to seize any machines.”\n\nThe panel’s witnesses Thursday included Ayres and Jason Van Tatenhove, a former spokesman for the Oath Keepers.\n\nWhen all else failed, committee members say, Trump’s efforts culminated in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nThat pained Brad Parscale, who worked on Trump\'s 2016 campaign and was his first 2020 campaign manager. In a text exchange with fellow Trump campaign veteran Katrina Pierson, Parscale said ""I feel guilty"" for helping Trump.\n\nIn particular, he said, he was saddened that Trump\'s actions had led to the death of a supporter, Ashli Babbitt, who was shot as she tried to enter the room adjacent to the House chamber on Jan. 6. He attributed her shooting to Trump\'s riling up his base before the attack.\n\n""It wasn\'t the rhetoric,"" Pierson wrote.\n\n""Katrina,"" Parscale replied. ""Yes, it was.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/30/politics/january-6-transcript-release-latest/', 'Headline': 'Trump wanted to trademark ‘Rigged Election!’ and other key findings ...', 'Snippet': 'The House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, on Friday released another wave of witness interview transcripts.. The new drop, which complements the panel’s sweeping 845-page report ...', 'Full_text': 'The House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, on Friday released another wave of witness interview transcripts.\n\nThe new drop, which complements the panel’s sweeping 845-page report and is among a steady stream of transcripts released over the past week, includes interviews with some of the most intriguing figures in the committee’s probe into the US Capitol attack.\n\nThose witnesses include Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’s wife, Ginni Thomas, who told the committee that she regretted texts she sent to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows encouraging election reversal efforts.\n\nTrump White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato – whose interview transcript was also released Friday after the committee publicly questioned his credibility in its report – pushed back on another key witness’ claim that he had recounted to her a dramatic episode involving Trump in his motorcade.\n\nFormer Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, meanwhile, shed new light on how a Trump team shift in strategy came to be.\n\nThe latest transcript drop comes as the panel winds down its work with the House majority set to change hands from Democrats to Republicans next week at the start of the new Congress. The releases have shed new light on how the House committee conducted its investigation of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol – and new details about what key witnesses told the panel.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from the latest disclosures:\n\nTrump wanted to trademark ‘Rigged Election!’ days after 2020 election, emails show\n\nThen-President Donald Trump wanted to trademark the phrase “Rigged Election!” days after Election Day in 2020, according to emails provided by Jared Kushner to the House select committee.\n\nOn November 9, 2020, then-Trump aide Dan Scavino emailed Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, with the request from Trump.\n\n“Hey Jared! POTUS wants to trademark/own rights to below, I don’t know who to see – or ask…I don’t know who to take to,” the email from Scavino reads, according to a transcript of Kushner’s testimony to the committee, which was released by the panel on Friday.\n\nTwo phrases were bolded in the email: “Save America PAC!” and “Rigged Election!”\n\nKushner forwarded the request and discussed it on an email chain that included Eric Trump, the president’s son; Alex Cannon, a Trump campaign lawyer; Sean Dollman, the chief financial officer of Trump’s 2020 campaign; and Justin Clark, a Trump campaign lawyer.\n\n“Guys - can we do ASAP please?” Kushner wrote.\n\nEric Trump responded, saying: “Both web URLs are already registered. Save America PAC was registered October 23 of this year. Was that done by the campaign?”\n\nDollman responded: “‘Save America PAC’ is already taken/registered, just confirming that. But we can still file for ‘Save America.’”\n\nKushner’s response, according to the transcript, was: “Go.”\n\nGiuliani explains Trump team pivot to state legislatures\n\nA feeling that courts weren’t comfortable with Trump’s legal challenges to the 2020 election drove the Trump team’s pivot to state legislatures, former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the select committee earlier this year.\n\nThe theory that the US Constitution lets state legislatures intervene in the presidential election results first came up within the week after the election, Giuliani told congressional investigators. But he and then-fellow Trump attorney Jenna Ellis looked more closely at the idea when the lawsuits challenging the results weren’t getting traction.\n\n“We just got a bad feeling that these judges didn’t – they didn’t want to hear witnesses, citizens, American citizens, and that if American citizens could get up and testify, there were so many of them that it would make a very big difference,” Giuliani said in his May deposition.\n\nThe theory that a state legislature could override the results of a state’s presidential vote is considered a fringe one, and Congress recently enacted statutory changes to limit legislatures’ ability to do so.\n\nAt one point, Giuliani said, “It seemed to me the courts didn’t want to be involved in a political question like this. And there was a kind of a discomfort too. Somehow we were trying to think, well, who would resolve something like this. And we started reading the Constitution.”\n\nGinni Thomas explains why she was ‘disgusted’ with Pence in text sent days after January 6\n\nVirginia “Ginni” Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, told the committee that when she said she was “disgusted” with then-Vice President Mike Pence in a text on January 10, 2021, she wasn’t referring to his refusal to stop the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s win, but rather to her frustration with him not talking up election fraud claims. There was no evidence of widespread election fraud in the election.\n\n“I was frustrated that I thought Vice President Pence might concede earlier than what President Trump was inclined to do,” Thomas said, according to a transcript released Friday. “And I wanted to hear Vice President Pence talk more about the fraud and irregularities in certain states that I thought was still lingering.”\n\n“I wasn’t focused on the Vice President’s role on January 6th,” she said, when asked specifically if the text – previously reported by CNN – was connected to how he handled that day.\n\nAt another point in the interview, committee member Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, asked Thomas what specific episodes of fraud concerned her.\n\n“I can’t say that I was familiar at that time with any specific evidence,” she said, pointing instead to what she heard from “friends on the ground” and “grassroots activists” who had “found things suspicious” at polling places.\n\n“I don’t know specific instances,” she said. “But certainly I think we all know that there are people questioning what happened in 2020, and it takes time to develop an understanding of the facts.”\n\nThe committee had only limited questions about Thomas’ interactions with her husband and his role on the Supreme Court – an area she would likely be able to decline to answer questions about, given the confidentiality allowed for married couples.\n\nHer husband had no idea she was texting Meadows, Thomas told the investigators.\n\n“He first learned of my text messaging with Mark Meadows in March when he was in the hospital and this committee released them,” she said in her interview.\n\nThomas said she regretted text messages sent to Mark Meadows after 2020 election\n\nGinni Thomas told the House select committee she regretted the text messages she was sending to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the election.\n\n“I regret the tone and content of these texts … I really find my language imprudent and my choices of sending the context of these emails unfortunate,” Thomas said.\n\nThomas’ mea culpa to the committee, captured in a transcript of her September interview that was released publicly Friday, marks a rare moment of public reflection from one of the more intriguing avenues the House panel pursued, after obtaining Meadows’ texts. Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, had been sending Meadows messages about challenging the election results. She explained to the committee at her interview she was concerned about a concession of the election before accusations of fraud were fully explored.\n\n“It was an emotional time. I was probably just emoting,” she said, in response to direct questions from committee member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. “Some of these are just things I was showing were moving through the movement and I’m regretting that they became public … Certainly I didn’t want my emotional texts to a friend released and made available.”\n\nAn attorney for Thomas said in a statement Friday that her “post-election activities” after Trump lost in 2020 were “minimal and mainstream.”\n\n“Her minimal activity was focused on ensuring that reports of fraud and irregularities were investigated,” attorney Mark Paoletta said in the statement. “Beyond that, she played no role in any events following the 2020 election. She also condemned the violence on January 6.”\n\nKey witness Tony Ornato tells committee he didn’t recall details, citing ‘fog of war’\n\nOne of the key witnesses in the House committee’s investigation, former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato, told the panel he couldn’t recall details from January 6, amid what he called “the fog of war” during the US Capitol attack.\n\nOrnato has been a central figure in the investigation since former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified that he relayed to her how the then-president angrily tried to redirect his motorcade to the Capitol that day – another detail that Ornato told the committee he didn’t recall.\n\nOrnato told the committee that most of his job on January 6 involved relaying information he received to then-chief of staff Meadows and said he couldn’t recall specific details when asked about who was trying to encourage Trump to send out a statement that day.\n\n“I’ll be honest with you, it was a very chaotic time in trying to get the information, and it was usually late information or it wasn’t accurate or it was the fog of war and it was misrepresented. And it was very – a very chaotic day, so I don’t recall those specific details,” Ornato said.\n\nDuring a public hearing in June, Hutchinson testified that Ornato told her Trump was angry he couldn’t go to the Capitol on January 6 after his speech at the Ellipse and that, during the ride back to the White House, he reached toward the front of the car to grab at the steering wheel.\n\nAccording to Ornato’s November testimony to the committee, which was released Friday, Ornato did not recall the conversation with Hutchinson and said he was “shocked” by her testimony.\n\n“I was called to put it on,” Ornato told the committee, referring to Hutchinson’s televised testimony, “and I was shocked and surprised of her testimony and called Mr. Engel and asked him, ‘What is she talking about?’”\n\nOrnato said that Robert Engel, the lead Secret Service agent in Trump’s motorcade on the day of the US Capitol attack, didn’t know what Hutchinson was referring to. Hutchinson testified that Ornato relayed the story about Trump’s outburst to her back at the White House, while Engel was in the room.\n\nThe committee makes clear in its final report it did not find Ornato’s testimony credible.\n\nTrump attorney questioned statistics on supposed dead voters in 2020 election\n\nAn attorney on Trump’s post-election legal team questioned some of the statistics being used to support claims of mass fraud, pointing out that many supposedly dead voters in Georgia likely sent in their ballots before they died, according to a January 6 committee transcript released Friday.\n\nThe committee read an email from the attorney, Katherine Friess, to Giuliani during the panel’s interview with him. In the email, Friess weighed in on a chart being prepared for Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican.\n\n“Many of the dead voters on the Georgia list sent their vote in before they passed. I don’t think this makes a particularly strong case, and I think it’s possible that Chairman Graham will push back on that,” Friess said in the email, according to the committee investigators who were questioning Giuliani.\n\nCNN previously reported that another Trump lawyer, Christina Bobb, told the committee that Graham promised to “champion” Trump’s election fraud claims, saying: “Just give me five dead voters.” And Georgia election officials told Trump they found two votes cast in the names of dead people, not 5,000 as the former president suggested.\n\nFriess said in her email that she was raising the issue so that everyone is aware of “what the data actually says.” Hundreds of names on the list were of people who had died after their ballot was received, according to the committee’s description of the chart.\n\nAn attorney who represented Friess in litigation she brought to block a committee subpoena of her phone records did not immediately respond to CNN’s inquiry about her email.\n\nTrump White House liaison denies she was banned from Justice Department\n\nA Trump administration official who was accused of trying to access sensitive Justice Department election-related information denied in testimony to the committee that she was barred from entering the DOJ’s building, as was reported at the time.\n\nHeidi Stirrup, who was working as the White House liaison to the DOJ during the 2020 election, said that her badge to enter in the building was deactivated briefly in November 2020, but that after a day or two it was reactivated and she was able to reenter the building.\n\nIn her deposition with the committee, Stirrup recounted conversations she had with then-Attorney General Bill Barr and another DOJ official when she was seeking information about what the department was doing to investigate voter fraud allegations after the 2020 election. She told congressional investigators that she “took it upon” herself to talk to the DOJ officials about how the department was approaching the allegations, after being asked by “friends” not in the federal government what was going on.\n\nStirrup told the committee that Will Levi, the other DOJ official she spoke to, shared with her a memo Barr sent to the department outlining the authority that US attorneys had to investigate allegations presented to them in their state. According to the transcript, Stirrup emailed that memo to various other Trump administration officials – including John Zadrozny and John McEntee, who both worked in the White House. She told the committee that she couldn’t recall having conversations with any of those individuals about DOJ’s investigations into the allegations, and said she shared with them the memo because she thought they would be interested in it.\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide said he hadn’t intended to be on ‘team crazy’\n\nRobert Sinners, who worked on the Trump campaign’s Election Day operations in Georgia in 2020 and helped organize the slate of alternate GOP electors there, told congressional investigators that his “intent was never to be aligned with team crazy.”\n\nSinners said he was assured that lawyers had signed off on the alternate elector plan and didn’t realize that numerous lawyers working with the Trump campaign had soured on the electors idea by the time the fake electors were convening on December 14, 2020, according to a transcript released Friday night.\n\nIn hindsight – after more fully understanding the extent of the schemes to overturn the 2020 election and the reservations some Trump attorneys had about these plots – Sinners told investigators he was both “ashamed” to have helped organize the fake electors and “angry.”\n\nCNN previously reported that Sinners emailed the fake electors asking for “complete secrecy and discretion” on December 13, 2020, a day before the GOP electors convened at the Georgia capitol. Sinners told the panel that efforts to ensure Georgia’s GOP electors met in secrecy had more to do with skirting Covid-19 restrictions and avoiding protesters than keeping the elector plan under wraps.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/january-6-hearings-june-21/index.html', 'Headline': 'Jan 6 hearings day 4: Trump pressured state officials to overturn the ...', 'Snippet': 'The House Jan. 6 select committee’s fourth hearing of the month just wrapped up. The panel focused on how former President Donald Trump and his allies pressured officials in key battleground ...', 'Full_text': 'The latest hearing before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection revealed new details Tuesday about how former President Donald Trump pressured state officials to help him overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe panel featured testimony from three Republican officials who were all on the receiving end of Trump’s outreach after the election: Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, his deputy Gabe Sterling and Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers.\n\nLike previous hearings, these officials testified about their unwillingness to participate in legally dubious schemes that would undermine the election, including efforts to subvert the Electoral College with fake pro-Trump electors.\n\nThe panel’s next hearing is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET on Thursday and will focus on Trump’s attempt to use the Justice Department to back his election disinformation.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Tuesday’s hearing:\n\nRepublican witnesses tie Trump directly to fake electors effort\n\nMultiple witnesses told the committee that Trump was personally involved in the effort to put forward slates of fake electors in key battleground states — a key part of the broader effort to overturn Biden’s legitimate election victory.\n\nCNN has previously reported on the role that key Trump allies, including his former attorney Rudy Giuliani, played in overseeing the effort but witnesses revealed new details Tuesday about how the former President himself was not only aware of the push, but seemingly endorsed it.\n\nBowers told the committee that he received a call from Trump and Giuliani during which they urged him to go along with a plan to put forward illegitimate, pro-Trump electors from the state.\n\n“I told them I did not want to be used as a pawn,” Bowers said on Tuesday, recalling what he told Giuliani and Trump on the Nov. 22, 2020 phone call.\n\nCommittee reveals new details about how congressional Republicans helped Trump’s efforts to overturn election\n\nTuesday’s hearing featured new details about two congressional Republicans played a role in Trump’s sprawling efforts to try to overturn his 2020 election loss. The first was Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who called Bowers on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, asking him to support decertification of his state’s electors for Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Bowers testified on Tuesday.\n\nThe second occurred several hours later, minutes before then-Vice President Mike Pence gaveled in the joint session of Congress to certify the electoral votes. According to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin asked an aide to Pence how Johnson could hand-deliver him the fake slates of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, which had not been sent to the National Archives. Pence’s aide responded that Johnson should “not give that to him.”\n\nBoth the effort to decertify Biden electors and put forward fake Trump electors were part of the Trump team’s scheme to stop the congressional certification of the election on Jan. 6. The role that Trump’s allies in Congress played have been of interest of interest to the committee, which has subpoenaed five House GOP members, including Biggs and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWitnesses describe how Trump’s lies had serious consequences — including threats\n\nThe committee’s hearing underscored how the lies about the election spread by Trump and his team spiraled into multi-faceted disasters for the state officials forced to grapple with them.\n\nAll of the witnesses who appeared at Tuesday’s hearing talked about the serious repercussions they faced as a result of the false claims that Trump and his team put forward. That included pressure to help in the effort to overturn the election, the repeated attempts to try to debunk the claims and the threats they faced from pro-Trump supporters for refusing to go along with Trump’s efforts.\n\nBowers delivered emotional testimony about “disturbing” protests outside his home. He got emotional as he discussed the impact protests at this house had on his wife and his daughter, who was at home gravely ill at the time and was “upset by what was happening outside.” He also read passages from his personal journal about friends who had turned on him.\n\nRaffensperger described the attacks that his wife faced after the election, which he said he suspected was an attempt to pressure him to quit. Schiff cited Raffensperger’s book, in which he wrote, “I felt then and still believe today that this was a threat.”\n\nRepublican officials take the lead testifying against Trump\n\nYet again, the Democratic-run January 6 committee turned to Republican officials to make their case against Trump. In fact, the majority of the in-person witnesses so far have been Republicans.\n\nTuesday’s hearing featured in-person testimony from three conservative Republicans who endorsed Trump in 2020. The committee also played deposition clips from two other GOP officials: Michigan State Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and Pennsylvania House Speaker Bryan Cutler.\n\nThey all provided damning testimony against Trump, describing how he repeatedly tried to twist their arms and cajole them to overturn the results. They also described the threats and pressure they faced from Trump supporters who believed his election lies and protested outside their homes and offices and bombarded them with calls and text messages.\n\nTop Arizona Republican refutes Trump in real-time\n\nBowers said under oath Tuesday that Trump lied about him in a press release that came out shortly before the hearing started, where Trump claimed Bowers told him in November 2020 that he believed the election was rigged.\n\nIn the statement, Trump attacked Bowers and described a call they had after the election, claiming, “during the conversation, he told me that the election was rigged and that I won Arizona.” Trump added, “Bowers should hope there’s not a tape of the conversation.”\n\nUnder questioning from Schiff, Bowers confirmed that he “did have a conversation with the president, but that certainly isn’t it.”\n\nEmotional testimony highlights victims of Trump’s disinformation\n\nLater in the day, the committee heard from Wandrea “Shaye” Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, who were election workers in Atlanta during the 2020 election. Trump, Giuliani and other GOP figures put them both at the center of their unhinged lies about massive voter fraud in Georgia.\n\nCoverage of Trump’s presidency often focused on his words and lies. But the emotional and deeply personal testimony from Moss and Freeman flipped the script and showed the human toll of Trump’s lies.\n\nThey described in devastating terms how Trump’s lies essentially destroyed their lives.\n\nMoss said she felt “helpless” and stopped giving out her business card because “I don’t want anyone knowing my name.” Her mother said she gets “nervous when I have to give food orders” because someone who believes Trump’s lies might recognize her name. She said she felt “homeless” while she lived in hiding for two months after the FBI told her she wasn’t safe at home.\n\n“I have lost my sense of security, all because of a group of people, starting with (Trump) and his ally Rudy Giuliani, decided to scapegoat me, and my daughter, Shaye, to push lies about how the election was stolen,” Freeman said in a videotaped deposition, a clip of which was played during Tuesday’s hearing.\n\nGOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee, made a public appeal for testimony from former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone at the end of Tuesday’s hearing.\n\nThe request raises a new tension behind the scenes, where the House is still seeking testimony from one of the most significant advisers to former President Donald Trump in the last days of his White House.\n\nCheney noted that upcoming hearings will shed light on Cipollone and others in his office doing “what was right,” as they tried to stop some Trump’s movements leading up to Jan. 6, 2021. Others who sided with Cipollone and against Trump at crucial moments, including former top Justice Department officials, have already spoken with the committee and had clips of their depositions used in hearings so far.\n\nNearly every person in Trump’s innermost circle in the White House, including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, sat for questioning in the House. Cippoline has met informally with the committee, but clips of any closed-door interview with Cipollone have not been shown in any of the hearings so far.\n\nCNN reported last week that Cipollone was not expected to appear. One other inner circle White House adviser, Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff, has refused to testify.\n\nTestimony from Cipollone would be especially notable because his predecessor in the Trump White House, Donald McGahn, resisted testifying in a congressional probe about the Russia investigation for years. The Trump administration claimed the former White House counsel had absolute immunity — a position the Biden administration rolled back, leaving McGahn to testify about Trump to Congress last year.\n\nThe Biden administration has not used broad claims of executive privilege to protect large amounts of testimony from the Jan. 6 committee, though Trump has repeatedly said he believes some of his conversations with top advisers should be kept confidential.\n\n“Our committee is certain that Mr. Trump does not want Mr. Cipollone to testify here,” Cheney said.\n\nCheney spoke to reporters in the hallway after Thursday’s hearings, telling them that the committee will “continue to reach out” to Cipollone.\n\nAsked by CNN’s Manu Raju if Tuesday’s hearing showed any criminal behavior by Trump, Cheney said: “I think that you’ve seen throughout the hearings that we are putting forward very clearly a number of instances in which there are serious questions about the actions of the former President. We’ll continue to do so.”\n\nAccording to a person familiar with the matter, Cipollone has resisted providing public testimony, believing that he has sufficiently cooperated with the committee by sitting for a closed-door interview along with his deputy Pat Philbin,\n\nThe Biden White House cleared Cipollone and Philbin’s private interview after weeks of discussions that navigated the sensitive issues raised by having a White House counsel, one of the closest advisers to a president, sit down with the committee.\n\nTrump has not raised objections to Cipollone and Philbin talking to the committee despite claiming executive privilege claims over other testimony and documents, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.\n\nThe prospect of having Cipollone appear at a public hearing harkens back to John Dean and the Nixon era, an uncomfortable prospect for Cipollone who has long sought to keep a low profile.\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju and Morgan Rimmer contributed reporting to this post.\n\nA video produced by the House Select Committee detailed former President Donald Trump and his team’s efforts to sway election officials and intimidate election workers following President Biden’s 2020 election win.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the details the committee laid out:\n\nProtests outside officials’ homes: In a video played by the committee, protesters stood outside the home of Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson calling her a “tyrant and a felon,” as she was putting her child to sleep. She described to the committee, via audio recording, her fear for her family’s safety.\n\nPersonal phone numbers posted online: In late November 2020, Trump invited delegations from Michigan and Pennsylvania to the White House. After Michigan State Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Republican, told Trump that he would not break the law to keep Trump in office, he said Trump posted Shirkey’s personal phone number for his millions of followers on Facebook, urging them to contact him and demand he decertify Michigan’s election results. Shirkey said he received “just shy of 4,000 text messages over the short period of time, calling to take action.”\n\nDaily phone calls: Following his refusal to contest his state’s election results, Pennsylvania House Speaker Brian Cutler said he received daily phone calls from former Trump lawyer’s Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Lewis asking to discuss the election. Cutler said he asked his lawyers to tell the pair to stop calling, saying their efforts were inappropriate: they did not stop. One month later, long-time Trump ally Steve Bannon announced a protest against Cutler at his home and offices. Cutler said his then-15-year-old son was home alone when the first protest happened. He said that his personal information was leaked online and received so many calls to his home phone, that he had to disconnect it because messages were filling up so fast at all hours of the night. The select committee showed an anonymous voice mail Cutler received saying that the caller was outside his home.\n\nMillions of dollars in ads: According to the committee, the Trump campaign spent millions of dollars on ads pushing election fraud claims and urging Americans to call their legislators and demand they inspect voting machines.\n\n“20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voicemails and texts”: Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers described to the committee the harassment he and his family faced after refusing to decertify his state’s election results. Bowers said he and his team received “20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voicemails and texts.” At home, Bowers’ Saturdays were filled with protests by various groups disrupting the neighborhood with trucks playing videos claiming he was a pedophile and pervert. He recalled a confrontation between a protester with a gun who was vocally threatening his neighbor. Bowers detailed his family’s strength during this time, especially that of his wife and then “gravely-ill” daughter.\n\nDeath threats and a home break in: The committee played excerpts of a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call obtained by CNN between Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Trump where the former President urged Raffensperger to “find” votes to overturn the election. Raffensperger refused, claiming Georgia’s election results were accurate. Following this conversation, he said both he and his wife were doxed and received death threats, he told the committee. Additionally, he said his widowed daughter-in-law’s home was broken into while she was alone with her two young children.\n\n“I’ve lost my name, I’ve lost my reputation, I’ve lost my sense of security”: Former Fulton County, Georgia, election workers Wandrea “Shaye” Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman were specifically targeted by Trump’s team to push false allegations of voter fraud. The pair worked the 2020 presidential election and were named 18 times by Trump in the call made to Raffensperger. In that call, Trump called Freeman a “professional vote scammer and a hustler.” Moss detailed the harassment her grandmother faced as well, including a home invasion where people were looking for Moss and Freeman, claiming to be making a citizen’s arrest. In a video testimony to the committee, Freeman said, “I’ve lost my name, I’ve lost my reputation, I’ve lost my sense of security.” Prior to Jan. 6, the FBI advised Freeman to leave her home for safety — she was gone for two months.\n\nThe House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, just wrapped up its fourth hearing of the month.\n\nThe panel heard live testimony from several Georgia election officials about former President Trump’s efforts to try to pressure state officials to overturn the 2020 election, incorrectly claiming there was voter fraud.\n\nThe witnesses testified about the details of their conversations with the former President. They also said they experienced threats and harassment as a result of Trump’s lies. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his chief operating officer Gabe Sterling and former Fulton County, Georgia, election worker Wandrea “Shaye” Moss were on the panels.\n\nRaffensperger emerged as a national figure in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Trump urged Georgia’s chief elections officer to “find” enough votes to overturn the state’s election results.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had already spoken privately with the Jan. 6 committee about his experience in addition to testifying before the special grand jury in the criminal probe into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the Peach State.\n\nHere’s what the officials told the Jan. 6 committee:\n\nBrad Raffensperger: Raffensperger said he and his team investigated “every single allegation” of election fraud from former President Trump — and they came up with nothing indicating any fraud whatsoever.\n\nHe said in the face of threats and harassment to him and his family, he didn’t walk away because he knew his office had followed the law. “I think sometimes, moments require you to stand up and just take the shots,” he said. “We followed the law and we followed the Constitution, and at the end of the day, President Trump came up short.”\n\nRaffensperger said the numbers don’t lie, explaining to the committee how the ballots were checked three separate times, all with very close accuracy. “Every allegation we checked. We ran down the rabbit trail to make sure our numbers were accurate,” he said.\n\nGabe Sterling: Sterling described the misinformation and threats that were being directed at workers in the days after the election. During testimony, he recalled the moment he “lost it” when he found out an election contractor working for Dominion Systems was receiving death threats “that had been posted by some QAnon supporters.” After that, he started trying to combat misinformation at news conferences and said that he even argued with some family members about false claims of election fraud.\n\nHe said the job of the secretary of state’s office is to continue to combat that feeling and “get the facts out, do our job, tell the truth, follow the Constitution, follow the law and defend the institutions… and the institutions held.”\n\nWandrea “Shaye” Moss: Moss was accused by Trump and others of carrying out a fake ballot scheme in Fulton County, Georgia. She said she and her family received threats and Trump’s lies turned her life “upside down.” Moss told the committee about “hateful” and “racist” threats she received via Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me. Telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like ‘be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Moss said, adding that she loved her job and loved helping voters with any questions they had.\n\nThe committee also played video of recorded testimony from Moss’ mother, Ruby Freeman. She said she lost her “name and her reputation,” adding that she left her home for about two months ahead of Jan. 6, 2021, after the FBI told her it wouldn’t be safe. Freeman said agents told her she needed to stay away until “at least the inauguration.” She also testified that even today there is “nowhere” she feels safe.\n\nRead takeaways from today’s hearing here.\n\nThe head of the Republican Party testified to the House select committee that former President Donald Trump called her as part of an effort to use fake electors to support him.\n\nThe new detail links Trump directly to efforts to put forward rogue, alternate slates of electors in states that he lost, even though his top lawyers in the White House and the campaign knew the approach wasn’t legally sound.\n\nShe noted that the electors were being pulled together in case Trump legal challenges succeeded in blocking Biden wins.\n\nThe campaign wasn’t entirely on board, however.\n\nSome of the top officials in the Trump campaign and White House believed the fake electors plan wasn’t legal, and left the push to lawyers like Eastman and Rudy Giuliani who had swarmed after the election, the committee said.\n\nIn an interview with the committee, Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to the White House chief of staff, confirmed to the committee that lawyers with the White House counsel said the plot was not legally sound. She said former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani were involved in the meeting.\n\nTwo top campaign lawyers, Matt Morgan and Justin Clark, said in their taped depositions that they told Trump lawyers pushing the fake electors scheme they didn’t want to take part.\n\n“You just get after it. I’m out,” Clark told the House, about a conversation he had with another lawyer who backed the fake electors plan, Kenneth Chesebro. “I don’t think this is appropriate. This isn’t the right thing to do.”\n\nMorgan described directing another campaign official to tell Chesebro: “This is your task. You are responsible for the Electoral College issues moving forward. This was my way of taking that responsibility to zero.”\n\nBefore Tuesday, it wasn’t known that Clark had spoken to the House select committee.\n\nA source familiar with Clark’s testimony says he testified “a while back” and that Trump is likely not pleased his former lead campaign attorney is shown saying essentially his campaign didn’t have a case to back up Trump’s lies.\n\nClark still works with Trump. Last year he directed witnesses the House had subpoenaed to preserve executive privilege, and he represented Trump in his unsuccessful appeal to try to stop the release of White House documents from the National Archives.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol turns its attention Tuesday to the campaign to pressure state-level officials to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nThe hearing will focus in particular on then-President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results in Arizona and in Georgia — where Trump infamously asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” the votes he needed to win.\n\nCommittee aides said the witnesses testifying in person on Tuesday from Arizona and Georgia will be able to speak to the pressure campaign that came from the White House, as well as the backlash they received from Trump’s supporters.\n\nThe witnesses from Georgia include Raffensperger and his chief operating officer, Gabe Sterling, both of whom faced relentless attacks from Trump after certifying the state’s election. Fulton County election worker Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, who was falsely accused by Trump of ballot fraud, will also testify about the backlash she faced.\n\nArizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican, will testify about the pressure he received from Trump and Giuliani, according to committee aides.\n\nHere are key things to watch for during today’s hearing:\n\nThe Meadows connection: Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee member who will lead Tuesday’s hearing, told the Los Angeles Times on Monday that the hearing would show how Trump’s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had played an “intimate role” in the efforts to pressure Georgia state legislators and election officials.\n\nThe California Democrat said the committee would release new text messages showing that Meadows had wanted to send autographed “Make America Great Again” hats to those conducting Georgia’s post-election audit.\n\nCommittee aides said the hearing would “demonstrate his involvement” in Georgia in the run-up to Jan. 6.\n\nMeadows reached out multiple times to Raffensperger after the 2020 election, according to text messages obtained by CNN, and he participated in Trump’s January 2021 call where the former President asked Raffensperger to “find” the votes the then-President needed to win.\n\nWhile that call was going on, Meadows was texting with the deputy secretary of state, who urged him to end the call that now stands at the center of Fulton County’s investigation into whether any of the actions Trump or his allies took related to Georgia’s election were criminal.\n\nTestimony from those who faced backlash from Trump’s attacks: The witnesses will be able to testify firsthand on Tuesday about the impact of Trump’s pressure campaign and false claims about the election — as they all were subjected to attacks and threats.\n\nAides said that Bowers, the Arizona secretary of state, will be able to testify about the “campaign of harassment” he was subjected to in the run-up to January 6 and the months that followed.\n\nRaffensperger and Sterling were attacked by Trump and his allies for certifying Georgia’s election. Sterling warned in a December 2020 news conference that “it’s all gone too far” after local election officials had been subjected to threats and harassment.\n\nMoss, who was a Fulton County election worker in 2020, will testify how her mother’s and her lives were upended and they were forced to go into hiding after Moss was accused by Trump of carrying out a fake ballot scheme, according to committee aides. She and another election worker sued Giuliani last year.\n\nIn her written testimony provided on Monday, Moss said the false stories accusing her of taking part in voter fraud had led to her receiving death threats.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nBritish filmmaker Alex Holder acknowledged Tuesday that he has complied with a subpoena from the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, turning over footage that includes never-before-seen interviews with former President Donald Trump, members of the Trump family and then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nHolder, who was filming a documentary series surrounding the final six weeks of Trump’s re-election campaign, wrote in a statement Tuesday that the interviews were filmed before and after the events of Jan. 6.\n\nHolder also says he will be deposed by the committee on Thursday. Politico first reported the committee’s subpoena of Holder. A Select Committee spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nSenior Trump campaign officials were caught off guard when they learned that the British filmmaker was given extensive access in the final weeks of President Trump’s 2020 campaign, several told CNN.\n\nThe first time senior campaign staff heard of the documentary was when it was reported by Politico Tuesday morning, according to one of the senior staffers. Another senior official on the campaign told CNN he was totally unaware Trump was cooperating with Holder, who says he has complied with a subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee to share his footage.\n\nThis aide, who traveled often with the President and worked out of his Arlington, Virginia, campaign headquarters, said he was also never asked to sign anything granting his permission to be filmed.\n\n“I don’t remember it. I honestly don’t recall ever being told about something like that,” the official said.\n\n“The first time senior 2020 campaign leadership ever heard of the documentary was this morning’s Politico Playbook,” another added.\n\nStephanie Grisham, who was chief of staff to former first lady Melania Trump during the campaign, told CNN she “had no idea” a filmmaker was documenting Trump’s reelection campaign and final days in the White House.\n\nA third campaign official also said the committee’s subpoena of a documentary filmmaker who was cooperating with Trump was news to him even though he spent most of his time on the campaign trail with the candidate himself.\n\n“I heard about it in passing,” said a third Trump campaign official, who is now involved in Trump’s post-presidential operation. “It wasn’t necessarily a secret.”\n\nTwo attorneys for Trump’s 2020 campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the two Republicans on the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot, said Sunday he thinks the committee is presenting a case against former President Trump that would “rise to a level of criminal involvement,” while also making clear that the Justice Department will ultimately decide whether to bring criminal charges for what happened on and leading up to Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Obviously, you know, we’re not a criminal charges committee. So I want to be careful in specifically using that language, but I think what we’re presenting before the American people certainly would rise to a level of criminal involvement by a president and definitely failure of the oath,” he added.\n\nCNN has reported committee members are in wide agreement that Trump committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. But they are divided over whether to make a criminal referral of Trump to the Justice Department, according to four sources connected to the panel.\n\nThe Illinois Republican reiterated this week’s hearings will focus on Trump’s efforts to push state officials to overturn 2020 election results, as well as a broader pressure campaign to involve the Justice Department in his scheme.\n\nHe said the committee’s purpose is to lay out Trump’s actions to the American people, and “what can the Department of Justice do in a court of law…that’s up to them. They can, you know, have their own information, they’ll be able to see what we’re doing here.”\n\nABC’s George Stephanopoulos said Kinzinger’s staff shared threatening communications with ABC News that the congressman had received that was too “ugly” and “dangerous” to share with viewers on screen.\n\nKinzinger explained the message was mailed to his house a few days ago from the local area, threatening to execute him, his wife and their five-month-old child.\n\n“I don’t worry, but now that I have a wife and kids, of course, it’s a little different,” he said. “There is violence in the future. I’m going to tell you. And until we get a grip on telling people the truth, we can’t expect any differently,” he said.\n\nThe House Jan. 6 committee will show evidence at its upcoming hearing about then-President Donald Trump’s involvement in a scheme to submit fake slates of electors in the 2020 presidential election, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the panel, said Sunday.\n\nFederal prosecutors are reviewing the fake Electoral College certifications created by Trump allies that falsely declared him the winner of seven states that he lost in 2020. The fake certificates were sent to the National Archives in the weeks after the election and had no impact on the electoral outcome.\n\nWhen asked by Bash specifically if the committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol had evidence Trump directed the fake electors scheme, Schiff responded, “I don’t want to get ahead of our hearing.”\n\n“We’ll show during the hearing what the President’s role was in trying to get states to name alternate slates of electors, how that scheme depended initially on hopes that the legislators would reconvene and bless it,” he said, adding, “We will show you what we know about his role in this.”\n\nThe committee’s upcoming hearing on Tuesday will also feature Georgia election officials and the Arizona House speaker who resisted pressure from Trump and his campaign to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nWith regards to witnesses: Schiff also said the committee still has “several key people we have not interviewed we would like to” and could still possibly subpoena former Vice President Mike Pence as part of its investigation.\n\n“(He’s) certainly a possibility,” Schiff said. “We’re not excluding anyone or anything at this point.”\n\nAlso Sunday, another House January 6 panelist said there needed to be “accountability” for the wrongdoing displayed in evidence and testimony before the select committee, but stopped short of calling on the Department of Justice to charge Trump.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that “accountability can mean two things. One is individual criminal accountability that people pay for their particular crimes, as more than 800 people have already been prosecuted for everything from assaulting a federal officer to interfering with a federal proceeding to seditious conspiracy.”\n\n“But accountability also means collective accountability, and that’s the real project,” he continued. “Telling the truth to the people so we can make decisions about how to fortify democratic institutions going forward.”\n\nMeanwhile, when asked by Bash about the January 6 committee’s decision not to turn over documents related to its investigation to the DOJ, Schiff defended the panel’s stance, saying, “I don’t think Congress has ever done that.”\n\nThe Justice Department had raised concerns in court that the select committee had not shared transcripts and was jeopardizing its ability to prosecute and investigate the Jan. 6 events. Schiff said the committee will work with the DOJ and “want them to be successful in bringing people to justice, but I can’t go into the private conversations.”\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol wrapped up its third hearing of the month on Thursday. The panel presented evidence that outlined former President Donald Trump’s role in pressuring former Vice President Mike Pence into blocking the 2020 election results.\n\nThrough live testimony from former Pence attorney Greg Jacob and retired judge J. Michael Luttig, recorded depositions and excerpts from emails and memos, the committee showed that Trump was told the plan to reverse the results of the election was not legal — but he tried it anyway.\n\nHere are the top headlines you might have missed:\n\nTrump’s attempts to pressure Pence: In her opening statements, committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney said that what Trump wanted Pence to do “was not just wrong, it was illegal and unconstitutional.” Members of the committee are in wide agreement that Trump committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. But they are split over what to do about it, including whether to make a criminal referral of Trump to the Justice Department, four sources connected to the panel told CNN.\n\nA “constitutional crisis:” Luttig testified that if Pence had followed Trump’s orders to reject the 2020 election result, it “would have been the first constitutional crisis since the founding of the republic.” He also testified that he believes the Jan. 6 committee is examining the “profound truth” of the US. He later said he “would have laid (his) body across the road” before advising Pence to overturn the election.\n\nProximity to the mob: The committee also laid out a timeline detailing the effort going on during the insurrection to protect Pence. The panel said the vice president was very close to the rioters, and at one point there was only “40 feet between the vice president and the mob.” According to committee member and Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar: “Make no mistake about the fact that the vice president’s life was in danger.”\n\nThe John Eastman memo: Eastman, a former Trump attorney, perpetuated the theory that Pence had the authority to decide the results of the election. In the memo presented by Cheney, Eastman argues there is a “historical precedent” for the vice president to reject electors. Luttig said in his testimony that Eastman was “incorrect” and there is no precedent and nothing in the Constitution or US laws that support the theory in the memo. Jacob then testified that Eastman told him that he knew the theory would lose at the Supreme Court unanimously.\n\nPressure even after the insurrection: Even after the Capitol riot was over, the committee said Eastman wrote an email that night imploring Jacob to suspend the session to certify the election. Jacob said he did not show Pence the email right away, but shared it a “day or two later.” Eastman argued a technical violation of the Electoral Count Act, the law that governed the Jan. 6 congressional certification of the electors. A few days after the insurrection, Eastman emailed Rudy Giuliani asking to be included on a list of potential recipients of a presidential pardon, according to the committee.\n\nIn the West Wing: Jacob testified that Pence called him into his office when he first heard the theory that the vice president could announce the outcome of the election. “The vice president’s first instinct when he heard this theory was that there was no way that our framers, who abhorred concentrated power and who had broken away from the tyranny of George III, would ever have put one person — particularly not a person who had a direct interest in the outcome because they were on the ticket for the election — in a role to have a decisive impact on the outcome of the election,” Jacob said, adding that instinct was correct. He said Pence’s legal team reviewed every election in American history, and no vice president in 230 years has ever claimed to have that kind of authority.\n\nRead key takeaways from the hearing:\n\nThe Republican who serves as Georgia’s top elections official is set to testify before the hearing held by the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol, multiple sources familiar with the plans told CNN.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, 66, is probably best known for refusing then-President Donald Trump’s push in a bombshell phone call to “find” votes in Trump’s favor needed to overturn the 2020 presidential results in Georgia. During the Jan. 2, 2021, call, Trump lambasted his fellow Republican for refusing to falsely say that he had won the election in Georgia and repeatedly touted baseless claims of election fraud.\n\nRaffensperger has continued to defend his performance and remains committed to the idea that the election was conducted fairly and offered a warning to those who charged otherwise without evidence.\n\nIt was among the strongest public stands for election integrity taken by a Republican under immense pressure from Trump and his followers — and it wasn’t without consequences.\n\n“You and your family will be killed very slowly,” read one anonymous text that Raffensperger’s wife, Tricia, told Reuters in an exclusive interview last year that she had received, an example of the kinds of threats and scrutiny his family faced. Brad Raffensperger told CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” at the time that the threats were unacceptable.\n\nRaffensperger became a pariah of sorts within the GOP, facing calls for resignation from within his own party and censure at the Georgia GOP convention in 2021 due to “dereliction of his constitutional duty.”\n\n“Let me start by saying that is not going to happen. The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,” he said at the time in response to the calls for him to step down.\n\n“As secretary of state, I’ll continue to fight every day to ensure fair elections in Georgia, that every legal vote counts and that illegal votes don’t count,” Raffensperger continued.\n\nRaffensperger, whose term is set to end next year, is running for reelection. He faced three opponents in the primary election in May, and CNN projected Raffensperger would win andbe the GOP nominee.\n\nHis leading opponent, Republican Rep. Jody Hice, had aligned himself with Trump’s political brand and previously said Trump would’ve won the 2020 election in Georgia if it had been “fair” — a stance that garnered an endorsement from the former President.\n\nIn a primary field in which his Republican opponents had committed themselves to fighting voter fraud — despite the fact that such fraud barely exists and President Biden’s 2020 victory in the Peach State was affirmed by three ballot counts — Raffensperger has expressed commitment to the same issue.\n\nRaffensperger has also supported a controversial law passed in the wake of Biden’s victory to impose new voting restrictions.\n\nThe secretary of state, who touts himself as a conservative Republican, took office in 2019. He had served two terms in the Georgia General Assembly in 2015-2019.\n\nRead more about the official here.\n\nJustice Department officials are watching the House select committee Jan. 6 hearings for what kind of possible crimes the committee believes it has uncovered.\n\nMembers of the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol are in wide agreement that former President Donald Trump committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. But they are split over what to do about it, sources close to the committee said.\n\nIt’s possible that at the end of the panel’s investigation, it makes criminal referrals or something less formal by turning over evidence that prosecutors could examine.\n\nRemember: A criminal referral is not an official responsibility of the Jan. 6 panel. And the DOJ would be under no legal obligation to act on the committee’s request, though it could force Attorney General Merrick Garland and his prosecutors into a difficult public position.\n\nAt the same time, if the committee opts not to make a referral, it would likely miss its best chance of making a forceful statement that it believes Trump committed a crime. Choosing not to make a referral would also mean abdicating one of the committee’s only levers of political pressure at its disposal.\n\nDuring a hearing for the criminal case against the Proud Boys, Justice Department prosecutors said that the committee is planning to release all 1,000 witness transcripts from its investigation in early September, coinciding with the trial of five Proud Boys charged with seditious conspiracy for their involvement in the riot.\n\nWhere the DOJ investigation stands: Seventeen months after the riot, the Justice Department has arrested over 840 individuals, charging roughly 255 with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers that day – 90 of whom are charged with using a weapon or causing serious injury to an officer.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, over 50 defendants have been charged with conspiracy, ranging from conspiring to obstruct a congressional proceeding to conspiring to obstruct law enforcement.\n\nSixteen individuals – members of the far-right groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers – have been charged with seditious conspiracy for their alleged actions that day, three of whom have pleaded guilty to the charge.\n\nBut the investigation is not close to being over. The Justice Department is still looking for over 350 individuals who they say “committed violent acts on Capitol grounds.”\n\nMost recently: A Capitol rioter pleaded guilty Friday to carrying a loaded firearm on Capitol grounds and assaulting police officers with one of their own batons during the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nMark Mazza told federal investigators he regretted not seeing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the riot and that they would be talking “for another reason” if he had seen her. He faces a maximum of 20 years for assaulting officers with a dangerous weapon.\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, Mazza, 57, carried a revolver loaded with shotgun and hollow point rounds in a holster under his shirt during the “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the riot and on Capitol grounds later that day.\n\nThe fourth Jan. 6 hearing this month is about to start. Here are some key points to catch up on before the next hearing gets underway.\n\nFormer President Trump didn’t want the Capitol riot to stop\n\nDuring the committee’s first prime-time hearing, it revealed testimony from Trump White House officials who said the former president did not want the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, to stop. He angrily resisted his advisers urging him to call off the rioters and thought his own vice president “deserved” to be hanged, according to the testimony.\n\nVice Chair Liz Cheney described a witness who said Trump was aware of chants to “hang Mike Pence” and seemed to approve of them.\n\nLater, at the hearing last week, the committee sought to connect Trump’s pressure campaign against Pence to the violence on Jan. 6 by weaving together testimony from Pence aides, as well as Trump’s public statements and comments from rioters at the Capitol.\n\nMany of the rioters had listened to Trump’s rallies where he claimed — inaccurately — that the election was rigged against him, and Pence had the power to do something about it while presiding over the Electoral College certification, the committee said.\n\nAnd many of them saw, in real time, Trump’s tweet criticizing Pence while the Capitol was under attack, where he said Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done.”\n\nThe committee showed that the mob got about 40 feet from Pence.\n\nJohn Eastman knew his theory to overturn the election was illegal\n\nThe hearing underscored how John Eastman, a former Trump attorney, had pushed over and over for Pence to try to overturn the election, despite facing sharp resistance from White House lawyers and Pence’s team.\n\nThe committee showed memos in which Eastman laid out his theory. Witnesses from Pence’s legal team testified that there was nothing in the Constitution or US law that supported the scheme. The committee played testimony from video depositions where White House officials explained how they thought Eastman’s theory was “nutty” before Jan. 6 — and told him so. Former Pence attorney Greg Jacob described Eastman’s plans as “certifiably crazy.”\n\nOn the evening of Jan. 6 — after rioters had attacked the Capitol and forced the vice president and his team to flee — Eastman tried to leverage the delay in certification by arguing there had been a minor violation of the Electoral Count Act and Pence should delay for 10 days as a result.\n\nJacob also testified that Eastman told him that he knew the theory would lose at the Supreme Court unanimously. Eastman emailed Rudy Giuliani a few days after Jan. 6 and asked to be included on a list of potential recipients of a presidential pardon, the committee said.\n\nTrump was told Eastman’s plan was illegal but tried it anyway\n\nAccording to witness testimony, Pence himself and the lawyer who concocted the scheme advised Trump directly that the plan was unconstitutional and violated federal law. Committee members argued that this shows Trump’s corrupt intentions and could lay the groundwork for a potential indictment.\n\nIn a videotaped deposition, which was played Thursday, Pence’s chief of staff Marc Short said Pence advised Trump “many times” that he didn’t have the legal or constitutional authority to overturn the results while presiding over the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 to count the electoral votes.\n\nEven Eastman, who pitched the scheme to Trump, admitted in front of Trump that the plan would require Pence to violate federal law, according to a clip of a deposition from Jacob.\n\nLegal scholars from across the political spectrum agree that Eastman’s plan was preposterous. J. Michael Luttig, the former federal judge who advised Pence during the transition, testified that he “would have laid my body across the road” before letting Pence illegally overturn the election.\n\nCommittee argues Trump peddled fraud claims after he was personally told they were not legitimate\n\nOne of the primary areas of focus of the committee has been to underscore the idea that Trump and some of his allies continued to peddle false claims of election fraud after they were personally told those claims were not legitimate.\n\nThe committee made the argument that Trump was repeatedly told by his own top officials, including former Attorney General William Barr and ex-Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, that the myriad of fraud claims he was pushing were groundless and were certainly not evidence that the election was stolen.\n\nYet, Trump and some of his allies continued to push these false claims all the way through January in what the committee attempted to show was a bad-faith effort to overturn the election despite consistently being told those claims were not valid.\n\nTrump’s team and family turn against him\n\nThe committee’s first hearing was bolstered with never-before-seen video clips showing members of Trump’s White House and campaign – as well as his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner – speaking about how they didn’t believe Trump’s claims that the election was stolen.\n\nBarr said that Trump’s claims of voter fraud were “bullshit.” Ivanka Trump said that she respected Barr and “accepted what he was saying” about the election.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said a campaign data staffer told Trump in “pretty blunt terms that he was going to lose.”\n\nAnd the committee cited testimony from Trump campaign lawyer Alex Cannon, who testified he told Meadows by “mid-to-late November” that the campaign had come up empty trying to find widespread fraud in key states that Trump lost. Cannon said Meadows responded to his assessment by saying, “so there’s no there there.”\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is set to continue to lay out its findings during a public hearing this morning. When and how the events occurred that day have been a key part of their probe.\n\nSupporters of then-President Trump breached the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, engulfing the building in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to protest against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to certify President Biden’s win.\n\nHere’s how key events unfolded throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump’s speech:\n\nAt 1:10 p.m. ET, while Congress began the process of affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, Trump encouraged his supporters to protest at the US Capitol. Despite promising he would join them, Trump retreated to the White House in his SUV and watched on television as the violence unfolded on Capitol Hill.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. ET, hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers “traitors” for doing their jobs.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Then-Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.\n\nAn armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.\n\nThe Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they had successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they were removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.\n\nThe US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first, and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building.\n\nWith about 30 minutes to go before Washington, DC’s 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds. It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.\n\nLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business — namely, confirming Biden’s win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.\n\nProceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence — who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary — bringing the Senate session back into order.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier on the evening of Jan. 6 that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session that night.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the “United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.”\n\nIt took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning (Jan. 7, 2021), but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden’s election win.\n\nSee the full timeline of events here.\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol — and now they are presenting what they discovered to the public.\n\nThe committee is holding another hearing Tuesday as it continues to roll out preliminary findings from its investigation in a series of presentations this month.\n\nThe committee is made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the panel.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel — and key things to know about them:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, chairman: Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, is the chairman of the House select committee. Thompson also serves as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, the first Democrat to hold the position. As chairman of the Homeland Security panel, Thompson introduced and oversaw the House’s passage of the legislative recommendations after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Thompson is a civil rights pioneer who started his political career by registering fellow African Americans to vote in the segregated South. His first political victory was being elected the first Black mayor of his hometown of Bolton, Mississippi. He is the only Democrat serving in Mississippi’s delegation. Thompson views the work of the Jan. 6 committee in the same vein as his work in the civil rights struggle.\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar: Aguilar is a Democrat from Southern California. Before coming to Congress, he served as the mayor of Redlands, California. Aguilar is considered a rising star in the House Democratic Caucus. As vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus he is the highest-ranking Latino member in congressional leadership. In addition to his role on the Jan. 6 committee, Aguilar has several high-profile committee assignments. He also is a member of the committees on Appropriations and House Administration. Aguilar believes the committee’s most important job is creating a full, comprehensive record of what led to the violence of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren: Lofgren is a Democrat from California who served as an impeachment manager in the first impeachment trial against Trump. Lofgren is also chair of the Committee on House Administration. She was first elected to Congress in 1994 and also served as a staffer on Capitol Hill for eight years. Lofgren has a background as an immigration lawyer and has made reforming immigration law a key part of her portfolio as a member of Congress. She also represents a big part of the Silicon Valley and as a result has had a heavy focus on tech related issues. She is a long-time ally and friend to Pelosi. The duo has served in the California Congressional delegation together for close to three decades and both represent different parts of the bay area in Northern California.\n\nRep. Elaine Luria: Luria is a Democrat from the Virginia Beach area who represents a community with a significant number of constituents connected to the military. Luria is a Navy Veteran. She served 20 years as an officer on Navy ships, retiring as a commander. She has attributed her military background as part of her motivation for serving on the Jan. 6 committee and getting to the bottom of what happened on that day. Of the nine members of the committee, Luria is facing the toughest general election in the fall midterms.\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy: Murphy is a Democrat from Florida and is the first Vietnamese American woman elected to Congress. Before serving in Congress, Murphy was a national security specialist in the office of the US Secretary of Defense. Murphy said the challenge for committee members is to translate the mountains of information learned through the investigation into a digestible narrative for the American people. Murphy announced in December 2021 that she would not be seeking reelection.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin: Raskin is a Democrat from Maryland who previously served as the lead impeachment manager for Democrats during Trump’s second impeachment trial. In the days before the Capitol insurrection, Raskin announced the death by suicide of his 25-year-old son, Tommy, on New Years Eve 2020. Raskin reflected on the tragic loss of his son, and his experience living through the attack on the Capitol, in his book “Unthinkable: Trauma, Truth and the Trials of American Democracy.” Raskin said that becoming the lead House impeachment manager last year served as a “lifeline” in the aftermath of his son’s death, describing to David Axelrod on “The Axe Files” podcast how Pelosi asked him to lead the second impeachment managers.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff: Schiff is a Democrat from California and also serves as the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He was the lead impeachment manager representing Democrats during Trump’s first impeachment trial. “January 6 will be remembered as one of the darkest days in our nation’s history. Yet, more than a year later, the threat to our democracy is as grave as ever. January 6 was not a day in isolation, but the violent culmination of multiple efforts to overturn the last presidential election and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in our history,” Schiff said in a statement to CNN.\n\nRepublicans\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, vice chair: Cheney, who represents Wyoming, serves as the vice chairwoman on the committee. Cheney has been an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump and was one of 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach him. House Republicans have punished her for her public opposition to Trump by removing her as their party’s conference chairwoman in May of last year and she faces a Trump-endorsed challenger in the GOP primary in her reelection bid. That primary is in August. Cheney told CBS in an interview that aired over the weekend that she believes the January 6 attack was a conspiracy, saying when asked, “I do. It is extremely broad. It’s extremely well organized. It’s really chilling.” She has even gone as far to say that Trump’s inaction to intervene as the attack unfolded was a “dereliction of duty.”\n\nAdam Kinzinger: Kinzinger of Illinois broke with his party by accepting the appointment from Pelosi. Kinzinger, once thought to have a bright future in GOP politics, has taken heavy criticism from his colleagues because of his criticism of Trump. He has placed much of the blame of inciting the violence that day on Trump and his allies. Kinzinger is one of 10 Republicans who voted twice to impeach Trump after the Capitol insurrection. He also voted for the bipartisan independent commission to investigate the riot. His willingness to take on Trump led to the former President personally promising to back a primary opponent. Instead of facing the prospect of a Trump back challenge, he chose to retire from Congress at the end of his current term.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/19/us/jan-6-committee-trump', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Committee Report and Hearing: Jan. 6 Committee Refers Former ...', 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol accused former President Donald J. Trump on Monday of inciting insurrection, conspiracy to defraud the United ...', 'Full_text': 'The criminal referrals were a major escalation for a congressional investigation that is the most significant in a generation. The panel named five other Trump allies — Mark Meadows, his final chief of staff, and the lawyers Rudolph W. Giuliani, John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro — as potential co-conspirators with Mr. Trump in actions the committee said warranted Justice Department investigation. The charges, including a fourth for Mr. Trump of conspiracy to make a false statement, would carry prison sentences, some of them lengthy, if federal prosecutors chose to pursue them.\n\nThe committee’s referrals do not carry legal weight or compel any action by the Justice Department, which is conducting its own investigation into Jan. 6 and the actions of Mr. Trump and his allies leading up to the attack. But the referrals sent a powerful signal that a bipartisan committee of Congress believes the former president committed crimes.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the referrals.\n\nMr. Trump attacked the committee as “highly partisan” ahead of a final meeting the panel held on Monday to release an executive summary of its final report on the Capitol attack and to vote on referring the former president to the Justice Department.\n\n“It’s a kangaroo court,” Mr. Trump said Monday on “The Dan Bongino Show.” “The people aren’t going to stand for it.” He elaborated on that theme in a post on Truth Social, his social media network, after the meeting.\n\n“These folks don’t get it that when they come after me, people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me,” he said, adding that he “told everyone to go home” on Jan. 6, but leaving out his hours of inaction before that while a mob of his supporters rampaged through the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans, who have vowed to investigate the committee after they take control of the House in January, mounted a modest response. Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 House Republican, was one of the few to react with a statement, accusing the committee of staging a “partisan charade.” She promised that Republicans “will hold House Democrats accountable for their illegitimate abuse of power.”\n\nThe executive summary, a 154-page narrative of Mr. Trump’s relentless drive to remain in power after he lost the 2020 election by seven million votes, identifies co-conspirators who aided Mr. Trump. But it singles out the former president as the primary cause of the mob violence.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straightforward conclusion: The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the summary stated. “None of the events of Jan. 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nThe summary closely follows the evidence from the committee’s 10 previous public hearings, but the facts have been assembled into a readable narrative that amounts to an astonishing story of Mr. Trump’s efforts to effectively overthrow the government he led. The committee is expected to release a lengthy final report on Wednesday.\n\n“Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one,” Representative Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican and vice chairwoman of the committee, said at the start of the meeting.\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee, said of Mr. Trump: “Nothing could be a greater betrayal of this duty than to assist in insurrection against the constitutional order.”\n\nThe summary and referrals have now set up a dynamic without parallel in the annals of American campaigns: Congress asking the Justice Department of an incumbent president to consider criminal charges against the president’s potential opponent in the next election. President Biden has indicated his intent to run in 2024, and Mr. Trump announced his re-election campaign last month.\n\nThe summary laid out step by step how Mr. Trump sought to cling to power, much as the committee did during its televised hearings in the summer. First, the summary said, Mr. Trump lied about widespread fraud, despite being told his claims were false. He then organized false slates of electors in states won by Mr. Biden as he pressured state officials, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election. Finally, he amassed a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol, where they engaged in hours of bloody violence while Mr. Trump did nothing to call them off.\n\n“Even key individuals who worked closely with President Trump to try to overturn the 2020 election on Jan. 6 ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful,” the committee wrote.\n\nThe panel also referred four Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee — including the man seeking to become the next speaker, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California — because of their refusal to comply with the panel’s subpoenas.\n\nMr. McCarthy’s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe other Republicans referred were Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Jordan, Russell Dye, said in a statement that the referral was “just another partisan and political stunt.” A spokesman for Mr. Perry, Jay Ostrich, said the committee was engaged in “more games from a petulant and soon-to-be kangaroo court.’’\n\nMr. Biggs said in a tweet that the referral was the committee’s “final political stunt” and that he looked forward to “reviewing their documents, publishing their lies and setting the record straight” in the next Congress.\n\nIn its summary, the committee did not entirely resolve disputed accounts of what happened inside the presidential S.U.V. when Mr. Trump was told by his Secret Service agents that they could not take him to the Capitol to join the crowd on Jan. 6. Cassidy Hutchinson, a former White House aide, testified under oath to the committee in public last summer that Anthony M. Ornato, a White House deputy chief of staff, told her that Mr. Trump grew so angry that he lunged at his Secret Service agent and tried to grab the steering wheel. The Secret Service denied that account anonymously.\n\nThe summary said only that the “committee has now obtained evidence from several sources about a ‘furious interaction’” that occurred in the S.U.V. “The vast majority of witnesses who have testified to the select committee about this topic, including multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Metropolitan Police and national security officials in the White House, described President Trump’s behavior as ‘irate,’ ‘furious,’ ‘insistent,’ ‘profane’ and ‘heated.’”\n\nThe committee’s summary also concluded that there was no nefarious reason for why the National Guard was delayed for hours in responding to violence of Jan. 6.\n\n“Although evidence identifies a likely miscommunication between members of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense impacting the timing of deployment, the committee has found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard,” the committee wrote. “The select committee recognizes that some at the department had genuine concerns, counseling caution, that President Trump might give an illegal order to use the military in support of his efforts to overturn the election.”\n\nIn its summary, the panel asked the Justice Department to investigate whether anyone had interfered with or obstructed the panel’s investigation, including whether any lawyers paid for by groups connected to Mr. Trump “may have advised clients to provide false or misleading testimony to the committee.”\n\nAmong the committee’s findings, revealed at its meeting on Monday, was that lawmakers became concerned that lawyers who were paid by Trump associates may have tried to interfere with the panel’s investigation. The panel also learned that a client was offered potential employment that would make her “financially very comfortable” as the date of her testimony approached. But then offers were withdrawn or did not materialize as reports of the content of her testimony circulated, the committee said.\n\nThe committee also chastised certain witnesses that it said had not been forthright with investigators. It said it had “significant concerns about the credibility” of the testimony of Mr. Ornato.\n\nThe committee also said Kayleigh McEnany, one of Mr. Trump’s former press secretaries, and Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, had been less than forthcoming.\n\nThe summary demonstrated, as the committee’s hearings did, how despite being told repeatedly that his claims of election fraud were false, Mr. Trump kept up the lies.\n\nBill Stepien, a former White House political director, told the committee how he and others would investigate the claims, find them to be false, and report back to the president. “It’s an easier job to be telling the president about, you know, wild allegations,” Mr. Stepien said. “It’s a harder job to be telling him on the back end that, yeah, that wasn’t true.”\n\nThe summary also contained evidence that certain White House aides had grown concerned about the potential for violence on Jan. 6 and urged Mr. Trump to make a pre-emptive statement calling for peace. No such statement was made.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House communications director, said she suggested “several times” on Jan. 4 and 5 that Mr. Trump “publicly state that Jan. 6 must remain peaceful, and that he had refused her advice to do so,” the panel wrote.\n\nThe panel played new video from Ms. Hicks, who described a conversation with Mr. Trump.\n\n“I was becoming increasingly concerned that we were damaging his legacy,” Ms. Hicks said she told the president.\n\nMr. Trump’s response? “Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,” she recalled him saying.\n\nWhile the executive summary of the report focused heavily on Mr. Trump, it did conclude some findings about law enforcement failures, a topic not previously addressed at the panel’s hearings. “No analysis recognized the full scale and extent of the threat to the Capitol on Jan. 6,” the committee wrote, although the “intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did successfully detect the planning for potential violence on Jan. 6, including planning specifically by the Proud Boys and Oath Keeper militia groups who ultimately led the attack on the Capitol.”\n\nOver the past year and a half, the committee interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, obtained more than one million documents, issued more than 100 subpoenas and held hearings that drew millions of viewers.\n\nThe House created the Jan. 6 committee after Senate Republicans used a filibuster to defeat a proposal to create an independent commission to investigate the attack.\n\nThe committee — made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans — consistently broke new ground for a congressional investigation. Staffed with more than a dozen former federal prosecutors, the panel set a new production standard for how to hold a congressional hearing. It also got significantly ahead of a parallel Justice Department investigation into the events of Jan. 6, with federal prosecutors later interviewing many of the same witnesses Congress had spoken to.\n\nIn recent weeks, federal prosecutors under the supervision of a special counsel have issued subpoenas to officials in seven states in which the Trump campaign organized electors to falsely certify the election for Mr. Trump despite the voters choosing Mr. Biden.\n\nLawmakers on the panel also believe they played a significant role in elevating the issue of threats to democracy to voters, who rejected many election deniers in the November midterms.\n\nIn terms of legislative recommendations, the panel has already endorsed overhauling the Electoral Count Act, the law that Mr. Trump and his allies tried to exploit on Jan. 6 in an attempt to cling to power. Lawmakers have also discussed changes to the Insurrection Act and legislation to enforce the 14th Amendment’s prohibition on insurrectionists holding office. Those recommendations are expected to be detailed in the committee’s final report.\n\nKatie Benner and Anushka Patil contributed reporting.\n\nAnnotation: This reflects the committee’s finding that Mr. Trump’s repeated false claims that the election was rigged had both a political and financial motive. During its second hearing, the panel introduced evidence that Trump supporters donated nearly $100 million to Mr. Trump’s so-called Election Defense Fund but that the money flowed instead into a super PAC the president had created. It was not just “the big lie,” the committee said. It was also “the big rip-off.”\n\n2. Knowing that he and his supporters had lost dozens of election lawsuits, and despite his own senior advisers refuting his election fraud claims and urging him to concede his election loss, Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome.\n\nAnnotation: Mr. Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results of the election and lost all but one of them. Many of the suits, the committee determined, were brought even after some of Mr. Trump’s closest aides — including his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and his attorney general, William P. Barr — told him that there was no fraud that could have changed the outcome of the race.\n\n3. Despite knowing that such an action would be illegal, and that no state had or would submit an altered electoral slate, Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress’s joint session on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: The committee discovered that the lawyer John Eastman had advised Mr. Trump to undertake a campaign to push Mr. Pence into single-handedly deciding the election in his favor even though there was evidence that Mr. Eastman knew the plan was illegal. Some of Mr. Pence’s own aides told Mr. Trump the same, but he pressured Mr. Pence nonetheless.\n\n4. Donald Trump sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice by attempting to enlist department officials to make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the presidential election. After that effort failed, Donald Trump offered the position of acting attorney general to Jeff Clark knowing that Clark intended to disseminate false information aimed at overturning the election.\n\nAnnotation: After leaders in the Justice Department — including Jeffrey Rosen, the acting attorney general, and Richard Donoghue, his deputy — told Mr. Trump that he was wrong about his claims concerning fraud in the election, Mr. Trump wanted to appoint Mr. Clark, a loyalist, to run the department. Mr. Clark had promised to send out letters to leaders in key swing states saying that prosecutors had in fact found fraud in the election. The president decided not to appoint Mr. Clark only after several senior department officials threatened to quit if he did.\n\n5. Without any evidentiary basis and contrary to state and federal law, Donald Trump unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states.\n\nAnnotation: In the weeks that followed the election, Mr. Trump and his allies had calls and meetings with local officials in key swing states like Michigan and Arizona in which they pressured the officials to use their powers to assign electors from the states to him. More famously, Mr. Trump also asked Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, to help him “find” the 11,000 votes he needed to win the election there.\n\n6. Donald Trump oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nAnnotation: This refers to one of Mr. Trump’s most expansive schemes to maintain his grip on power: a plan to have state officials create and submit fake electors pledged to him in seven swing states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n7. Donald Trump pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states.\n\nAnnotation: The committee found that Mr. Trump also played a role in a plan closely related to the fake-electors scheme: He helped to persuade 139 House Republicans to dispute the Electoral College count on the day the Capitol was attacked.\n\n8. Donald Trump purposely verified false information filed in federal court.\n\nAnnotation: In December 2020, Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit in Fulton County, Ga., contending that thousands of votes had been improperly counted and citing specific numbers of dead people, felons and unregistered voters who had cast ballots. Mr. Trump signed an official attestation attached to the suit swearing that the data in it was accurate despite the fact that one of his own lawyers, Mr. Eastman, had determined it was false.\n\n9. Based on false allegations that the election was stolen, Donald Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for Jan. 6. Although these supporters were angry and some were armed, Donald Trump instructed them to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to “take back” their country.\n\nAnnotation: The committee determined that a tweet posted by Mr. Trump on Dec. 19, 2020, announcing a “wild” protest in Washington on Jan. 6 was heard as a clarion call by both far-right extremists and ordinary Trump supporters who sprang into action preparing for the event. When they got to Washington for the rally, Mr. Trump’s speech calling on them to “fight like hell” was a central driver in sending them on toward the Capitol.\n\n10. Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: The tweet the committee is referring to here said, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.” Court papers show that some rioters at the Capitol responded directly to it by pushing toward and ultimately into the building.\n\n11. Knowing that violence was underway at the Capitol, and despite his duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, Donald Trump refused repeated requests over a multiple-hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television. This failure to act perpetuated the violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress’s proceeding to count electoral votes.\n\nAnnotation: The committee accused Mr. Trump of “a dereliction of duty” for letting nearly three hours pass between learning that the Capitol was under siege and calling for his supporters to leave the Capitol grounds. During that time, several people close to him — including his daughter Ivanka — begged Mr. Trump to issue a statement that would calm down the crowd.\n\n12. Each of these actions by Donald Trump was taken in support of a multipart conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n13. The intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did successfully detect the planning for potential violence on Jan. 6, including planning specifically by the Proud Boys and Oath Keeper militia groups who ultimately led the attack on the Capitol. As Jan. 6 approached, the intelligence specifically identified the potential for violence at the Capitol. This intelligence was shared within the executive branch, including with the Secret Service and the president’s National Security Council.\n\n14. Intelligence gathered in advance of Jan. 6 did not support a conclusion that antifa or other left-wing groups would likely engage in a violent counterdemonstration, or attack Trump supporters on Jan. 6. Indeed, intelligence from Jan. 5 indicated that some left-wing groups were instructing their members to “stay at home” and not attend on Jan. 6. Ultimately, none of these groups was involved to any material extent with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n15. Neither the intelligence community nor law enforcement obtained intelligence in advance of Jan. 6 on the full extent of the ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results. Such agencies apparently did not (and potentially could not) anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer the crowd in his Ellipse speech, that President Trump would “spontaneously” instruct the crowd to march to the Capitol, that President Trump would exacerbate the violent riot by sending his 2:24 p.m. tweet condemning Vice President Pence, or the full scale of the violence and lawlessness that would ensue. Nor did law enforcement anticipate that President Trump would refuse to direct his supporters to leave the Capitol once violence began. No intelligence community advance analysis predicted exactly how President Trump would behave; no such analysis recognized the full scale and extent of the threat to the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation for 13, 14 and 15: The committee has faced criticism, especially from Republicans, for not focusing more attention on the failures by intelligence and law enforcement officials on Jan. 6 and in the weeks leading up to the Capitol attack. But the panel did present some preliminary findings and may ultimately issue a separate report.\n\n16. Hundreds of Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan Police officers performed their duties bravely on Jan. 6, and America owes those individual immense gratitude for their courage in the defense of Congress and our constitution. Without their bravery, Jan. 6 would have been far worse. Although certain members of the Capitol Police leadership regarded their approach to Jan. 6 as “all hands on deck” the Capitol Police leadership did not have sufficient assets in place to address the violent and lawless crowd. Capitol Police leadership did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensue after President Trump instructed tens of thousands of his supporters in the Ellipse crowd to march to the Capitol, and then tweeted at 2:24 p.m. Although Chief Steven Sund raised the idea of National Guard support, the Capitol Police Board did not request Guard assistance prior to Jan. 6. The Metropolitan Police took an even more proactive approach to Jan. 6, and deployed roughly 800 officers, including responding to the emergency calls for help at the Capitol. Rioters still managed to break their line in certain locations, when the crowd surged forward in the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump’s 2:24 p.m. tweet. The Department of Justice readied a group of federal agents at Quantico and in the District of Columbia, anticipating that Jan. 6 could become violent, and then deployed those agents once it became clear that police at the Capitol were overwhelmed. Agents from the Department of Homeland Security were also deployed to assist.\n\n17. President Trump had authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on Jan. 6 or on any other day. Nor did he instruct any federal law enforcement agency to assist. Because the authority to deploy the National Guard had been delegated to the Department of Defense, the secretary of defense could, and ultimately did, deploy the Guard. Although evidence identifies a likely miscommunication between members of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense impacting the timing of deployment, the committee has found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard. The select committee recognizes that some at the department had genuine concerns, counseling caution, that President Trump might give an illegal order to use the military in support of his efforts to overturn the election.\n\nAnnotation: The question of why it took so long to deploy the National Guard to the Capitol is one of the enduring mysteries of Jan. 6. While the committee sharply criticized Mr. Trump for failing to taking action that day, it also found that there was no evidence the deployment of the Guard was delayed for political reasons.\n\nThe panel voted 9 to 0 to accept the final report and to urge the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against Mr. Trump and his allies in four separate areas of the law.\n\nHere are some takeaways:\n\nThe committee kept its focus on Trump.\n\nThe committee’s hourlong presentation focused almost exclusively on Mr. Trump, essentially ignoring findings about intelligence and security failures at the Capitol before and during the attack. The committee also did not dwell on the information it collected about the rise of domestic extremism.\n\nThe focus on Mr. Trump had been telegraphed for months as the committee drafted its final report, using it primarily as a means to hold Mr. Trump to account for his actions in trying to prevent the orderly transfer of power after a presidential election. As Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a Republican and the panel’s vice chairwoman, put it: “Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one.”\n\nIn one place, the report laid out the facts of how Trump attempted to stay in power.\n\nThe summary of the committee’s final report is a remarkable account of a president’s desperate attempt to stay in office following his election loss to Mr. Biden in 2020.\n\nWhile it breaks no new ground since the panel’s series of public hearings this summer, the report for the first time brings together all the facts in one place.\n\nThe report states that even people around Mr. Trump “ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful.”\n\nThe report laid out, step by step, how Mr. Trump sought to cling to power after losing the 2020 election: first, by lying about widespread fraud, despite being told his claims were false; by organizing false slates of electors in states won by Mr. Biden; by pressuring state officials, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election; and finally, by amassing a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol, where they engaged in hours of bloody violence while Mr. Trump did nothing to call them off.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straightforward conclusion: The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the report states. “None of the events of Jan. 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nThe committee revealed new details from two top advisers: Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway.\n\nThe committee revealed on Monday the investigative work it had done since the end of their previous hearings. That included the panel’s first interviews with two of the former president’s top advisers: Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway.\n\nMs. Hicks, who served as a senior adviser in the White House, said that when she raised concerns with the former president about the actions on Jan. 6 affecting Mr. Trump’s legacy, he responded that “nobody will care about my legacy if I lose. So, that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning.”\n\nThe committee also revealed testimony from Ms. Conway, who described telling Mr. Trump that Jan. 6 was a “terrible day.” She recalled him responding: “No. People are upset. They are very upset.”\n\nThe events of Jan. 6 hurt Trump but did not knock him out of 2024 contention.\n\nThe work of the committee over the past year has already helped to chip away at Mr. Trump’s political standing and his reputation as the nation’s 45th president. Ms. Cheney said again on Monday that Mr. Trump should never “serve in any position of authority in our nation again. He is unfit for any office.”\n\nAnd yet, Mr. Trump already has announced his pursuit of the presidency again, hoping to reclaim the office he falsely asserts was stolen from him. Despite a rocky campaign announcement and a swirl of potential criminal prosecutions, Mr. Trump remains a central figure in the Republican Party, with strong support across the country. And he has weathered setbacks, both political and legal, before.\n\nThe committee’s legacy is still an open question.\n\nThe legacy of the Jan. 6 committee is now out of the panel’s hands, and will most likely be determined by federal prosecutors in the coming months. It will be up to Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed to oversee investigations into Mr. Trump’s actions, to determine whether the information sent over by the committee, along with the Justice Department’s own material, warrants charging the former president with any crimes.\n\nThat remains an open question. Members of the committee were firm on Monday in their belief that Mr. Trump and the people around him violated four statutes in the planning and execution of the Capitol attack. They are: obstructing or influencing an official proceeding; conspiring against the U.S. government; making false statements to the government; and engaging in insurrection against the government.\n\nPursuing those charges, or others, against Mr. Trump would be a historic effort to hold the nation’s top official accountable for his actions. But it will be up to the special counsel, and ultimately Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, to decide whether to move forward. Other Justice Department officials will have to decide whether to charge Mr. Trump’s aides as committee members called for.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are already gearing up to discredit the committee when they take control of the House in January. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, who is seeking to become the speaker next year, has vowed to investigate the committee’s work and has demanded that the staff and lawmakers preserve records for that purpose.\n\nThe committee has not been a political boon for many of its members.\n\nThe end of the Jan. 6 committee is also the end of the House careers of four of the nine members of the panel.\n\nTwo of them — Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, and Representative Stephanie Murphy, Democrat of Florida — decided not to run for re-election in 2022. Mr. Kinzinger faced fierce opposition from within his own party because of his frequent criticism of Mr. Trump and his decision to be part of the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nTwo others — Ms. Cheney and Representative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia — lost their House seats in 2022. Ms. Cheney was defeated in her primary campaign in Wyoming after drawing the ire of party officials and voters for her opposition to Mr. Trump and her determination to hold him accountable for Jan. 6. Ms. Luria was defeated in the general election in Virginia.\n\nAll four have said they have no regrets about serving on the committee. But it is unlikely to serve as a political steppingstone for many of its members.\n\nThe panel’s recommendations that charges should be brought were based on an exhaustive investigation that spanned months and included interviews with key witnesses that even federal prosecutors may not have spoken to yet.\n\nIn presenting the committee’s findings, Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said he did not want the “foot soldiers” who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to go to jail while “the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass.”\n\nMr. Raskin explained that charges were warranted against Mr. Trump and others — chief among them the lawyer John Eastman, an architect of several plans to overturn Mr. Trump’s defeat. Nine months ago, Mr. Raskin noted, a federal judge in California, ruling in a civil case, concluded that there was evidence that Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman had conspired together to commit federal crimes.\n\nAs for the Justice Department’s efforts, not much is publicly known about any specific charges that the special counsel, Jack Smith, might be considering in a criminal prosecution. The department is under no obligation to adopt the committee’s conclusions or to follow its recommendations.\n\nStill, there has been some overlap between criminal statutes cited by the department and the charges the committee recommended, according to search warrants and subpoenas that have gradually surfaced during the federal inquiry.\n\nOne charge that both the panel and prosecutors have placed at the center of their work is obstruction of an official proceeding before Congress. The Justice Department mentioned that count in a warrant used in June to seize the cellphone of Jeffrey Clark, a former department official whom the committee referred for criminal charges on Monday.\n\nProsecutors have already used the obstruction count in nearly 300 criminal cases to describe how the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 disrupted the certification of the election that was taking place there during a joint session of Congress.\n\nDespite its wide use, the statute was never an easy fit for the violence that erupted at the Capitol.\n\nIt was passed into law as part of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which sought to curb corporate malfeasance by clamping down on things like shredding documents and tampering with witnesses. And defense lawyers have challenged its use in a federal appeals court in Washington, arguing that prosecutors stretched it beyond its original scope and used it to criminalize behavior that closely resembles protest protected by the First Amendment.\n\nStill, the obstruction count could apply much better to Mr. Trump’s behavior than to that of hundreds of ordinary rioters.\n\nThe law requires proving that any interference with a congressional proceeding be done “corruptly.” The committee said in its recommendations that Mr. Trump had clearly acted with a “‘corrupt’ purpose” because he was warned in advance that several of his schemes to maintain his grip on power were illegal.\n\nThe committee also recommended that Mr. Trump and others be charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, a count that has been used in several Justice Department cases against both far-right extremists and ordinary rioters who appeared to have planned in advance to storm the Capitol.\n\nAgain, this conspiracy charge may in fact better describe the evidence against Mr. Trump, who, according to the committee, defrauded the public by making constant false claims that the election had been rigged against him.\n\nAnother charge the committee recommended against Mr. Trump and others was conspiracy to make false statements. That count, according to the panel, was warranted because Mr. Trump took part in a wide-ranging scheme to send to Congress and the National Archives fake slates of electors declaring that he was the victor in several key states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nThe most serious charge the panel has recommended against Mr. Trump is also likely to be the hardest to prove: insurrection. While the Justice Department has won a conviction on a related charge, seditious conspiracy, against Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia, and is set to try five members of another far-right group, the Proud Boys, for sedition, it has not charged anyone with insurrection in more than 900 criminal cases.\n\nStill, a federal judge in Washington laid the ground for a potential insurrection case against Mr. Trump in a ruling in February that permitted a series of Jan. 6-related civil cases filed against the former president to move forward.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge, Amit P. Mehta, said Mr. Trump was not merely exercising his First Amendment right to free speech when he called on the crowd listening to him on Jan. 6 to march on the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n\nJudge Mehta also found that there was a reasonable case to be made that Mr. Trump had aided and abetted those in the mob who assaulted the police at the Capitol — in part by waiting so long to call publicly for the rioters to calm down. One of the ways prosecutors could prove that Mr. Trump engaged in insurrection is by showing that he gave “aid and comfort” to other insurrectionists who took part in a rebellion against the government.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/live-updates/jan-6-hearings-committee-criminal-referrals-trump-final-report', 'Headline': 'LIVE: Jan. 6 panel announces 4 criminal referrals for Donald Trump', 'Snippet': 'The Jan. 6 committee has officially outlined criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump and other individuals on four charges. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., discussed the charges at the ...', 'Full_text': 'Progressives have been irritated with Attorney General Merrick Garland’s methodical (read: slow) pace of pursuing charges against Trump. But it’s going to be up to the special counsel whether it brings charges or what they are.\n\nThey do not have to act on what the Jan. 6 committee recommends, though investigators are paying close attention to the details of its findings.\n\nBut don’t expect to hear much about the special counsel’s progress, as the DOJ tends to stay pretty quiet, if not wholly silent, on the details of ongoing investigations until they present them in court.\n\nPolitically, it’s going to be up to voters to choose. Trump will likely retain support with his base. As we noted, Republicans have been the least likely to be paying close attention to these hearings. In a multi-candidate primary, Trump remains the front-runner for the GOP nomination.\n\nBut he’s in legal trouble in multiple states, not just federally, and many of his preferred candidates – and election deniers – lost in swing states. So whether it’s because of the chaos that often surrounds him, the threat he presents to U.S. democracy and faith in its elections, or simply because his brand is not a winner in competitive states where Republicans likely need to win to take over the White House and Congress, Trump is at his most vulnerable point since winning the presidency six years ago.\n\nAnd the members of this committee – some of whom won’t be returning to Congress because of the wrath, or potential wrath, of Trump’s base – certainly hope voters respond.\n\n“The future of our democracy rests in your hands,” chairman Bennie Thompson D-Miss. said today. “It’s up to the people to decide who is deserving of the public trust.”\n\n➡️A full set of takeaways from NPR\'s Senior Political Editor, Domenico Montanaro, will be available on NPR.org tomorrow morning.\n\nIt’s no secret that the country is divided politically and partisanship, particularly among Republicans, has become entrenched. So despite the primary evidence – with testimony from Republicans who were aligned with Trump – people have been watching selectively.\n\nThe committee in its report recognized this:\n\n“Although the Committee’s hearings were viewed live by tens of millions of Americans and widely publicized in nearly every major news source, the Committee also recognizes that other news outlets and commentators have actively discouraged viewers from watching, and that millions of other Americans have not yet seen the actual evidence addressed by this Report.”\n\nSo the committee said it’s releasing video summaries with each relevant piece of evidence. And it’s likely why the beginning of the hearing included so many clips of previously seen testimony from past hearings, almost like the recap of a prior season of a series on Netflix.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest those who watched were moved. Before the hearings, just 48% of independents in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll said they thought Trump was to blame a “great deal” or “good amount” for what happened that day. After several hearings, the July survey found that the percentage blaming Trump spiked to 57%.\n\nRepublicans were only up marginally – and still fewer than 1-in-5 said Trump was responsible for what happened.\n\nEighty percent of Democrats and 55% of independents said they were paying “a lot” or “some” attention to the hearings. But 56% of Republicans said they were not.\n\nIt’s not hard to draw a straight line between the numbers of those paying attention and the movement – or lack thereof – in the survey.\n\n➡️A full set of takeaways from NPR\'s Senior Political Editor, Domenico Montanaro, will be available on NPR.org tomorrow morning.\n\nIt\'s now been more than an hour after the Jan. 6 committee hearing wrapped, and former President Donald Trump has made only one comment related to today\'s hearing: A knock on Vice Chair Liz Cheney\'s primary loss in August.\n\n""...But Liz Chaney lost by a record 40 points!"" he wrote, misspelling Cheney\'s name in a post on Truth Social, the social media network he founded in the wake of his bans from mainstream platforms like Twitter and Facebook after the riot at the Capitol.\n\nCheney, a Republican who is Wyoming\'s sole representative in the House, lost in the August primary to her Trump-endorsed challenger by 37.4 percentage points. As a result, she will not return to Congress next year.\n\nOn a day when the House committee referred him for criminal prosecution on four different charges, Trump instead focused most of his public statements on two other subjects: the possibility of a Trump-era immigration policy known as Title 42 coming to an end, and conservative media reports about content moderation decisions at Twitter during the 2020 election campaign.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump complained that the committee was ""highly partisan"" and accused its members of ""illegally leaking"" confidential information.\n\n""How much longer are Republicans, and American Patriots in general, going to allow this to happen,"" he wrote.\n\nAnd he applauded the reinstatement of his Twitter account and his two public posts on Jan. 6 asking rioters to ""remain peaceful."" Those tweets were sent long after he urged his supporters to march on the Capitol; by the time he made his first post, rioters had already been inside the Capitol for nearly 30 minutes, and at least one rioter was already dead, according to the timeline established by the Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation was hampered by lack of cooperation by witnesses, ultimately impacting the number of referrals the committee could send to the Justice Department, committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said Monday.\n\n""There were undoubtedly other people involved. But we were stymied by virtue of a lot of people refusing to come and testify, refusing to give us information they had, or taking the 5th Amendment,"" Raskin said, speaking to reporters immediately after the committee\'s meeting ended. ""We chose to advance the names of people where we felt certain that there was abundant evidence that they had participated in crimes, and so we\'re sending those over. It\'s not to the exclusion of anyone else.""\n\nThe evidence gathered by the committee will be shared in full with the Department of Justice this week, said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Much will be released to the public on Wednesday, including interview transcripts.\n\nThe DOJ has carried on its own investigation of the events leading up to Jan. 6, 2021. Some witnesses who refused to cooperate with the House committee may be compelled to cooperate with the Department of Justice, which has greater capabilities to enforce subpoenas.\n\n""The long and the short of it is we possess evidence that, up until this release, the Justice Department may not have. They possess evidence that we don\'t have. And the cumulative impact of all of that evidence will hopefully lead to justice for those who have broken the law here,"" said Rep. Schiff.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee has officially outlined criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump and other individuals on four charges.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., discussed the charges at the end of the committee\'s meeting on Monday, as well as the standard that it used to decide them.\n\n""We propose advancing referrals where the gravity of the specific offense, severity of its actual harm and centrality of the offender to the overall design of the unlawful scheme to overthrow the election compel us to speak,"" he said.\n\nThese are the charges the committee is making:\n\nObstruction of an official proceeding of the U.S. government: Raskin said the evidence described by his colleagues in hearings warrants a criminal referral of Trump, John Eastman and others for violation of Title 18, Section 1512C, adding that ""the whole purpose and obvious effect of Trump\'s scheme were to obstruct, influence and impede this official proceeding.""\n\nConspiracy to defraud the U.S.: Raskin said there is ""more than sufficient evidence"" to refer Trump, Eastman and others for violating Title 18, Section 371, which covers making an agreement to impair, obstruct or defeat the lawful functions of the U.S. government by deceitful or dishonest means.\n\nHe added that Trump didn\'t engage in these actions alone, and that the committee\'s full report details the efforts of co-conspirators who agreed with and participated in Trump\'s plan to defeat certification of Biden\'s victory. But he also stressed that the panel doesn\'t attempt to determine all potential participations, since many individuals have refused to answer its questions. It trusts the Justice Department will be able to form a more complete picture through its investigation, Raskin added.\n\nConspiracy to make a false statement: The committee alleges that Trump and others knowingly and willfully made materially false statements to the federal government in violation of U.S.C. §§ 371, 1001. Raskin said the evidence ""clearly suggests"" Trump conspired with others to submit slates of false electors to Congress and the National Archives. Like with the previous charge, Raskin said many individuals refused to answer questions under oath and that the Justice Department may be able to shed more light on this alleged conspiracy.\n\n""Incite,” “assist” or “aid and comfort” an insurrection: An insurrection is a rebellion against the authority of the U.S., Raskin said, a ""grave federal offense"" that is written into the constitution as grounds for automatically disqualifying participants from holding office at the state or federal level. Raskin said ""more than sufficient evidence exists"" for a criminal referral of Trump for assisting, aiding and comforting those at the Capitol.\n\nStressing the lack of cooperation by potentially key individuals, Raskin also said the committee is referring four members of Congress for sanction by the House ethics committee for failure to comply with lawful subpoenas. And he said all of these referrals are not a decision the committee took likely.\n\n""We understand the gravity of each and every referral we are making today, just as we understand the magnitude of the crime against democracy that we describe in our report,"" he said. ""But we have gone where the facts and the law lead us and, inescapably, they lead us here.""\n\nRaskin said that the events of Jan. 6 consist of ""hundreds of individual criminal offenses,"" most of which are already being prosecuted by the Justice Department. But he emphasized that ""ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass.""\n\nThe committee has issued approximately 100 subpoenas to individuals, organizations and corporate entities since it began its investigation.\n\nThe extensive list includes Republican lawmakers, Trump allies, even the ex-president himself. And though many of those who were subpoenaed cooperated with the committee, others did not.\n\nThe full list of subpoenas issued can be found here, but here are some of the notable names:\n\nSteve Bannon\n\nBreitbart News founder Steve Bannon, who also served as Trump’s chief political strategist, said “all hell is going to break loose” on his far-right podcast on the day before the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nHe was subpoenaed by the committee in September 2021, and after Bannon openly mocked the panel and its demands, he was indicted for refusing to provide documents and failing to appear before the committee.\n\nA judge sentenced Bannon to four months in jail and fined him $6,500 this past October, a lesser sentence than the six months and $200,000 federal prosecutors sought.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service\n\nThe committee subpoenaed one of the nation’s elite law enforcement agencies for deleted text messages from the days leading up to and after the Jan. 6 attack along with other electronic documents.\n\nThe Secret Service complied with the request and handed over more than 1 million emails, recordings and other electronic records to the committee.\n\nThe materials obtained through that subpoena showed that the Secret Service knew there was a threat of violence leading up to Jan. 6, and that agents feared for the vice president’s life.\n\nTrump and members of his family\n\nDonald Trump was subpoenaed at the end of the committee’s final hearing in October. And though many of his family members cooperated with the panel voluntarily, others did not, including Kimberly Guilfoyle, one of the former president’s advisors and fiancé of Donald Trump Jr.\n\nThe committee also subpoenaed the phone records of the ex-president’s other son, Eric Trump, who — along with Guilfoyle — spoke from the Ellipse on Jan. 6 before the former president told the mob to march on the Capitol.\n\nJohn Eastman\n\nThe former law professor joined Trump’s legal team in August 2020 but is best known for his plan for Trump to use then-Vice President Pence to overturn the election results, despite his understanding that doing so would be illegal. Eastman sought a presidential pardon from Trump but didn’t get one.\n\nEastman complied with the subpoena but invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at least 100 times.\n\n➡️Check out NPR\'s full subpoena tracker here.\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals to the Justice Department, there could be other categories of referrals as well — to the Federal Election Commission, the House Ethics Committee, and bar associations to discipline attorneys. The Justice Department is separately investigating the Jan. 6 attack with a special counsel.\n\nNPR obtained a small portion of a draft script for the Monday meeting that shows the panel intends to accuse lawyers John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro of being tied to the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nEastman was a Trump ally who helped lead the effort to overturn President Biden\'s win, while Chesebro has been considered a central figure in the scheme pushing for a slate of fake Trump electors in various states won by Biden.\n\nChesebro\'s attorney, Adam Kaufmann, in an emailed statement to NPR, pushed back of that assertion and said his client gave the Trump campaign pro bono guidance on ""arcane provisions"" of the Electoral Count Act and the 12th Amendment, which outlines procedural steps for electing the president and vice president.\n\nThe panel could also refer five House Republicans who were subpoenaed but refused to cooperate to the House Ethics committee: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut with the congressional session wrapping up in a matter of weeks and Republicans about to take control of the House, it\'s unlikely the ethics panel will launch any new probe.\n\nWhen asked at a press conference last week if he was concerned that he and his colleagues might face criminal referrals, McCarthy said, ""No, not at all. We did nothing wrong.""\n\n🎧Listen to NPR\'s Claudia Grisales discuss her reporting on Morning Edition.\n\nWhat\'s happening today?\n\nThe nine-member committee, which includes seven Democrats and two Republicans, is expected to discuss its final report during Monday\'s meeting. The lawmakers will vote on criminal referrals of key players who plotted to keep Trump in office. The panel is expected to consider criminal referrals for fewer than a dozen individuals. Each member will offer presentations highlighting the specific areas the panel worked on over the course of the investigation.\n\nWhen?\n\n1 p.m. ET\n\nWhy does today\'s meeting matter?\n\nThis is the culmination of a lengthy investigation into the attack on Jan. 6, 2021. The committee is also expected to provide its assessment of weaknesses in the electoral system, which members argued enabled Trump and his allies to go as far as they did in their attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The panel will make policy recommendations aimed at better protecting democratic institutions and processes, including reforming the Electoral Count Act.\n\nWhat\'s next after today?\n\nThe select committee will dissolve at the end of the current Congress, just after the start of the new year. Four members of the panel will not return to the House in 2023: Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the only two Republican members of the committee, along with Democratic Reps. Elaine Luria of Virginia and Stephanie Murphy of Florida.\n\nA lot has happened since the committee held its first hearing in July 2021. NPR has rounded up some of the critical takeaways from the investigation to help bring you up to speed.\n\nLaw enforcement described the attack as “brutal” in the committee’s first hearing\n\nFour police officers testified before the committee at its first hearing on July 27, 2021. One officer described his engagement with the thousands of protesters at the Capitol as ""nothing short of brutal"" and condemned politicians who tried to downplay the attack.\n\nThe officers called on the committee to find out who was responsible for the attack, noting that all signs pointed to former President Trump. One officer even used a hit man analogy to drive the point home to lawmakers.\n\n""If a hit man is hired and he kills somebody, the hit man goes to jail. But not only does the hit man go to jail, but the person who hired him does,"" said Pfc. Harry Dunn of the U.S. Capitol Police, adding, ""I want you to get to the bottom of that.""\n\nTrump tried to pressure Mike Pence into overturning results\n\nTestimony from two advisors to the former vice president painted a picture of Trump trying to strong arm Pence into illegally overturning the 2020 election results, knowing full well that he lost to Joe Biden.\n\nTrump called Pence a “wimp”, among other insults, fueling the crowds who began to call for Pence’s head, and continued to ridicule Pence long after the attack. The public hearing also laid out potential criminal liability for Trump and lawyer John Eastman for conspiring to obstruct Congress.\n\nA tidal wave of Trump allies sought pardons after Jan. 6\n\n""Just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,"" former President Trump said, according to the testimony of former acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue.\n\nWhite House staff and lawyers testified before the committee on June 23, 2022, that at least five members of Congress all sought pardons following the attack on the Capitol: Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Mo Brooks, R-Ala.; Louie Gohmert, R-Texas; Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; and Scott Perry, R-Penn. So did former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and lawyer John Eastman.\n\nThough they all denied any wrongdoing, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said, ""The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is if you committed a crime.""\n\nA former White House aide said Trump knew protesters were armed and didn’t care\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, previously an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, said in a pre-recorded testimony (played during the Jun. 28 hearing) that Trump knew some protesters were armed when he ordered them to march to the Capitol.\n\nShe went on to say that the former president became “irate” when he was told he had to return to the White House instead of joining his supporters at the Capitol. ""\'I am the effing president, take me up to the Capitol now,\'"" Hutchinson recalled the then-president saying.\n\nTrump sued the committee after it subpoenaed him in October\n\nAt the end of the committee’s hearing on Oct. 22, members unanimously voted to subpoena the former president.\n\n""In short, you were at the center of the first and only effort by any U.S. President to overturn an election and obstruct the peaceful transition of power, ultimately culminating in a bloody attack on our own Capitol and on the Congress itself,"" Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the panel\'s chair, and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., its vice chair, said in a letter to Trump.\n\nThe ex-president was supposed to turn over documents and appear before the committee in November, however, Trump decided not to cooperate and instead filed a lawsuit to avoid confronting the panel.\n\n➡️If you\'re looking for more highlights, check out the big, 14-item list from NPR\'s Senior Political Editor, Domenico Montanaro.'}}",92.91666666666667,2

Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene held a press conference marking one year since the Capitol riot Thursday where they promoted a fringe conspiracy theory that the federal government was behind the deadly events that day.\n\nThey claimed that people added to the FBI's Most Wanted list for breaking into the United States Capitol last year simply 'fall off' like Ray Epps, a military veteran who members of the far-right have claimed to be an 'FBI plant' goading Donald Trump's supporters into violence that day.\n\n'Congresswoman Greene and I are not here to celebrate January 6. We're not here to obsess about it, but we're here to expose the truth, to ask key questions about what happened on January 6, what animated the violence, the extent to which the federal government had been involved,' Gaetz said at the outset of their media event.\n\n'We know this -- January 6 last year wasn't an insurrection. No one has been charged with insurrection. No one has been charged with treason. But it may very well may have been a fed-surrection.'\n\nThe two firebrand Republicans countered Democrats' solemn day of retrospection to with their own alternative slate of programming focused on questioning the security failures that occurred that day and undermining House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's January 6 committee.\n\nThat included Greene appearing outside of the Capitol with the mother of Ashi Babbitt, the Air Force veteran who was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer when she was at the head of a mob breaking through a window near the Speaker's Lobby.\n\nGreene and Gaetz sought to frame the Trump supporters who entered the Capitol as having been manipulated by undercover federal agents and those who were subsequently arrested over it as political prisoners.\n\n'We are very concerned that we have sent letter after letter to Attorney General Garland and FBI Director Wray to simply get to the bottom of unexplained circumstances where people are on the FBI Most Wanted List from January 6, and then they fall off of that list,' Gaetz said during the press conference.\n\nThey played a series of videos that showed Epps, a Marine veteran who once ran a chapter of the far-right Oath Keepers group, directing people toward the Capitol on January 6.\n\nThere is no evidence that Epps ever entered the building himself that day and he was never arrested in connection with the storming.\n\nIn one video he's seen in the street on January 5 saying: 'I'm going to put it out there. I'm probably going to go to jail for it, OK? Tomorrow, we need to go into the Capitol. Into the Capitol…peacefully.'\n\nAt that point some in the crowd clearly believe he is a plant and begin to chant: 'Fed! Fed! Fed!'\n\nThe following day, Epps can be seen in another clip dressed in military-style clothing and yelling to a crowd: 'OK folks, spread the word. As soon as the president is done speaking, we go to the Capitol, where our problems are.'\n\nPointing behind him, he adds: 'It's that direction. Please spread the word.'\n\n'Imagine if we actually had the powers of the January 6 committee, the powers of the federal government to understand why Ray Epps, the evening of the 5th is out telling people dispassionately, professionally, with laser focus that the objective is to enter the United States Capitol building?' Gaetz said on Thursday.\n\nHe claimed Epps was on the FBI's Most Wanted List but was mysteriously removed after right-wing blog Revolver labeled him a 'Fed-protected provocateur.'\n\nBut rather than disband the committee, Gaetz said he would want to reshape it if Republicans took back the majority in 2022.\n\n'I would throw off the tyrants that are on that committee now. I would make Marjorie Taylor Greene the chair. I would make Darren Beattie the staff director, and then we would get the truth in front of the American people,' he said.\n\nGaetz also lashed out at GOP Senator Ted Cruz, who yesterday branded the riot a 'violent terrorist attack.'\n\n'The establishment will never love you, Ted,' Gaetz quipped.\n\n'You can bend over -- bend the knee for them, but they're just not gonna love you.'\n\nCruz's comments at a Wednesday Senate Rules Committee hearing are more in line with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's reflections a year after the insurrection than with Trump's, though like most allies of the former president he didn't ascribe him any blame.\n\n'I think that's maybe an effort by the good senator -- who we agree with on many, many things -- to recast himself in the eyes of some of the folks in your profession,' Gaetz told the journalists, adding: 'But we didn't find it particularly factual or sincere.'\n\nGreene said she 'completely disagrees' with Cruz and criticized his comments as 'irresponsible.'\n\nEarlier in the day she appeared alongside Micki Witthoeft, who stood outside the Capitol and declared the riot where her daughter Ashli Babbitt was killed was a 'protest' and not an 'insurrection.'\n\n'The mainstream media needs to stop pushing that narrative forward and at this point, that should be a libelous comment,' Witthoeft said standing next to Greene.\n\n'My daughter was a proud American patriot, she served this country her whole adult life, she loved God, loved America, loved her family, and came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election.'\n\nBabbitt's mother said 'she was murdered by a careless, reckless Capitol police officer, Michael Byrd, who should've been fired two years ago.'\n\nLast year two separate investigations, one by the Justice Department and an internal Capitol Police probe, cleared Byrd of any wrongdoing.""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/gop-reps-sue-anaheim-riverside-over-canceled-rallies-alleged-free-speech-violations-5407932', 'Headline': 'GOP Reps Sue California Cities Over Canceled Rallies, Alleged Free ...', 'Snippet': 'U.S. Rep.

That’s a violation of the Civil War-era Ku Klux Klan Act.”\n\nAnother rally was planned at a private venue in Laguna Beach, Calif., but the contract was canceled by the venue owners, who weren’t sued because there was no apparent evidence of government involvement, he said.\n\n“But when the [Anaheim] city code inspector threatened to revoke their conditional use permit, if they didn’t cancel the event, that made it government action,” Mr. Eastman said.\n\nLast month, the State Bar of California opened a case against Mr. Eastman—a former Chapman University law dean who represented Mr. Trump after the 2020 election amid widespread rumors of election fraud—to potentially revoke his law license, arguing that he spread false allegations of voter fraud to overturn the election results.\n\nThe case is pending in the courts, and Mr. Eastman doesn’t expect a ruling until fall.\n\n“This is an egregiously political hack job brought by organizations whose stated mission is to prevent conservative lawyers from representing conservative clients so that we don’t have election challenges from that side of the political aisle ever again,” he said in the interview.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Phil Pitchford, public information officer for the City of Riverside.

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/factchecking-claims-about-the-jan-6-capitol-riot/', 'Headline': 'FactChecking Claims About the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot', 'Snippet': 'The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was the culmination of months of false claims about election fraud. On that day -- and afterward -- we debunked false, misleading and unfounded claims ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/nancy-pelosi-january-6th-camera-crew-action/', 'Headline': 'Documentary footage of Pelosi on Jan. 6, 2021, doesn’t ... - Poynter', 'Snippet': 'Newly released security camera footage captured on Jan. 6, 2021, shows Nancy Pelosi being filmed by her daughter, documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, during the Capitol attack.', 'Full_text': 'A fraud.

Johnson claimed that footage proved Pelosi had a nefarious role in the incident.\n\n“She had a camera crew follow her around on January 6th,” he wrote. “New tapes show her waiting to stage her escape until the camera man (her daughter) said, ‘Action!’ It was all a movie.

(Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\nJohnson did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but the new footage he appears to have referred to was posted on Just The News, a conservative website founded by John Solomon, a journalist and opinion writer whose past work has furthered unproven narratives.\n\nThe video, which Solomon described as Capitol Police security footage that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy “made available” to Just The News, has no sound. It shows Pelosi walking through the corridors alongside members of her staff and security personnel. In the video, a woman who remains just steps away from Pelosi appears to be recording with a hand-held camera. Just The News identified that woman as Pelosi’s daughter Alexandra Pelosi.\n\nIt has been publicly reported by multiple news organizations that Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker, filmed her mother during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. This isn’t unusual. Fox News reported that she has filmed her mother at the Capitol for decades.\n\nIn October 2022, Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact there wasn’t a camera crew that day — just Alexandra Pelosi with a small, hand-held camera that she always carries.\n\nThe security camera footage posted by Just The News supports Hammill’s assertion.\n\nThe clips do not prove that the events on Jan. 6, 2021, were part of a scripted plan. During years of reporting on the attack, PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that the attack was contrived.\n\nFueled partly by the false belief that the presidential election had been stolen, hundreds of people — many clad in Trump-branded apparel, others in helmets and combat gear, some armed with weapons — stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, aiming to stop the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nRioters scaled walls, broke windows, forced their way into the building and repeatedly clashed with police. One woman was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer during the attack. The siege forced lawmakers to evacuate and temporarily delayed the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nSince the attack, more than 1,000 people have faced federal charges for crimes ranging from obstruction of Congress to using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Of those, more than 580 people have pleaded guilty and 514 have been sentenced, according to an NPR analysis.\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. Capitol’s top operations and maintenance official told lawmakers that the costs of the riot — including repairs, increased security and the provision of mental health services — would exceed $30 million.\n\nFalsehoods about the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including claims that it was a false flag, were named PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year. In the years since, we’ve continued fact-checking false claims about the attack; it was a real event with real consequences.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claimed “new tapes” of Nancy Pelosi show Jan. 6 “was all planned.”\n\nNewly released security camera footage captured on Jan. 6, 2021, shows Nancy Pelosi being filmed by her daughter, documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, during the Capitol attack.

This is Nancy,” Pelosi said in a call to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. “I don't know if you had been approached about the Virginia National Guard … but I still think you probably need the OK of the federal government in order to come into another jurisdiction.\n\n“Oh, my God, they're just breaking windows or doing all kinds of — it's really that somebody, they said somebody was shot,” she continued. “It's just horrendous, and all at the instigation of the president of the United States.”\n\nSchumer urged Rosen to get Trump to put out a statement calling off the mob.\n\n“Why don't you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility?” Schumer asked. “A public statement that they should all leave.”\n\n“They're breaking windows and going in, obviously ransacking our offices and all the rest of that.

Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/23/1145209559/jan-6-committee-final-report', 'Headline': 'The full January 6 report is out.

And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/video-nancy-pelosi-january-6-trump-pelosis-power-documentary/', 'Headline': 'How Nancy Pelosi Responded as Jan. 6 and Its Aftermath Unfolded - PBS', 'Snippet': 'As the U.S. continues to navigate fallout from Jan. 6, and as questions swirl about whether Democrats and Pelosi will maintain control of the House in the 2022 midterms, Pelosi’s Power offers an ...', 'Full_text': 'On Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election, Nancy Pelosi was among their targets.\n\nIn scenes from Pelosi’s Power, the first documentary on the life and legacy of the first woman speaker of the House, rioters chant Pelosi’s name as they move through the Capitol building. Footage captures them shouting, “Where are you, Nancy? We’re looking for you,” and “Yeah, we’re coming, bitch,” before entering her office.\n\nSusan Page, author of the Pelosi biography Madam Speaker, later asked Pelosi if she’d been afraid.\n\n“Nancy said that they would’ve had a fight on their hands. They would’ve had a battle on their hands, because she’s a street fighter,” Page tells FRONTLINE in the opening moments of Pelosi’s Power, embedded above. “And then she lifts up her foot. And, you know, she always wears those 4-inch stiletto heels. And she points at her shoe and says, ‘Besides, I could’ve used these as weapons.’”\n\nIn the hours and days to come, Pelosi would fight — not against the rioters but against the leader who had fueled the insurrection through false claims about a stolen election.\n\n“She really saw [then-President Donald Trump] as so reckless and dangerous,” says Molly Ball, author of Pelosi and a reporter on the new FRONTLINE documentary. “It was such a white-knuckle moment that, whatever the rules said, you just had to hold down the fort and make sure that things didn’t get further out of hand.”\n\nOn Jan. 7, as the above excerpt recounts, Pelosi called the Pentagon’s top general, Mark Milley, and asked about safeguards to prevent “an unstable president” from initiating any rash actions. Then Pelosi went to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and with him called Vice President Mike Pence, another target of the mob, to ask Pence to invoke the 25th amendment. When Pence didn’t take the call, Pelosi moved toward impeachment.\n\n“There was a total void of leadership in our country at that moment,” Judy Lemons, Pelosi’s chief of staff from 1987 to 2002, says in the above excerpt. “Nancy Pelosi was the one leading the country in that moment. She had to be the one dealing with this crisis. And that’s what she did.”\n\n“She found herself in a singular position of power, with a singular responsibility, at this crucial and dangerous moment, and that was not an accident,” Washington Post columnist Matt Bai says at the end of the clip. “That was a long time coming.”\n\nPelosi’s Power, premiering Tuesday, March 22 at 9/8c on PBS, is the first documentary to explore Pelosi’s journey from her 1987 election as a freshman representative (D-Calif.) to the highest-ranking member of the U.S. House of Representatives. The 90-minute film draws on dozens of in-depth interviews: with Pelosi herself; with her family; with her staffers, Congressional colleagues and fierce opponents; with White House insiders; and with journalists and biographers who have chronicled the career of the woman who is now second in line to the presidency.\n\nWhat emerges is a vivid portrait of one of America’s most powerful and polarizing political figures.\n\n“She’s a no-holds-barred politician that was about partisan warfare 100% of the time,” former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) says in the film.\n\nSays Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post, “Nancy Pelosi has never been accused of bringing a knife to a gunfight.”\n\nThe documentary traces Pelosi’s approach to wielding power back to her childhood in Baltimore, where her father was mayor and a U.S. representative. It explores how Pelosi navigated what Lemons calls “entrenched paternalism and crude sexism” after being elected to Congress in 1987 as one of only 23 women in the 435-person chamber. And it investigates her ascent to the speakership as she fought for policies in support of her self-described lifelong ambition: creating a better future for “the children.”\n\n“Nancy Pelosi came up in a historical era where you increasingly did see politics as combat,” Ball says in the documentary. “So she always said, ‘Every morning, I put on a suit of armor, eat nails for breakfast, and go out and do battle.’”\n\nIncluding, as the documentary shows, with Donald Trump.\n\nAs the U.S. continues to navigate fallout from Jan. 6, and as questions swirl about whether Democrats and Pelosi will maintain control of the House in the 2022 midterms, Pelosi’s Power offers an illuminating window into the speaker: who she is, what drives her and why she believes democracy itself is at stake.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/19/politics/what-is-in-jan-6-committee-report-summary/index.html', 'Headline': 'What’s in the House January 6 committee report summary', 'Snippet': 'Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., speaks as the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol holds its final meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, Monday, Dec. 19 ...', 'Full_text': 'CNN —\n\nThe full report was published December 22, 2021. Read here.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has concluded that former President Donald Trump was ultimately responsible for the insurrection, laying out for the public and the Justice Department a trove of evidence for why he should be prosecuted for multiple crimes.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straight-forward conclusion: the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the committee writes in a summary of its final report released on Monday. “None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him.”\n\nThe summary describes in extensive detail how Trump tried to overpower, pressure and cajole anyone who wasn’t willing to help him overturn his election defeat – while knowing that many of his schemes were unlawful. His relentless arm-twisting included election administrators in key states, senior Justice Department leaders, state lawmakers, and others. The report even suggests possible witness tampering with the committee’s investigation.\n\nThe committee repeatedly uses forceful language to describe Trump’s intent: that he “purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud” in order to aid his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and to successfully solicit about $250 million in political contributions. “These false claims provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.”\n\nThe full report, based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation by the nine-member bipartisan committee, will be released Wednesday, along with along with transcripts and other materials collected in the investigation.\n\nHere’s what’s in the report summary:\n\nThe committee thinks Trump and others committed crimes, and is referring them to DOJ\n\nThe House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Trump attorney John Eastman and “others.”\n\nThe report summary says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe committee says it also has the evidence to refer Eastman on the obstruction charge, and it names him as a co-conspirator in other alleged criminal activity lawmakers have gathered evidence on.\n\nIn addition, several others are named as being participants in the conspiracies the committee is linking to Trump, including then-DOJ attorney Jeffrey Clark and Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, as well as Trump-tied lawyers Kenneth Chesebro and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe committee alluded to evidence of criminal obstruction of the House investigation but the summary does not go into detail about that evidence.\n\nSeveral of the individuals named by the committee – including Trump, Eastman and Giuliani – had their own responses Monday.\n\nTrump’s false victory declaration was ‘premeditated’\n\nThe committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\n“President Trump’s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated,” the summary states.\n\nThe committee revealed emails from Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, from before the 2020 presidential election that say Trump should declare victory regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt also notes that Trump’s top allies, including those who testified before the committee, acknowledged they found no proof to back up the former president’s claims.\n\n“Ultimately, even Rudolph Giuliani and his legal team acknowledged that they had no definitive evidence of election fraud sufficient to change the election outcome,” the summary states, referring to Trump’s then-personal attorney.\n\n“For example, although Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election, he admitted during his Select Committee deposition that ‘I do not think the machines stole the election,’” it states.\n\nTrump’s belief that the election is stolen is no excuse, lawmakers say\n\nSources familiar with Trump’s legal strategy in the Justice Department probe have told CNN that his attorneys believe prosecutors face an uphill battle in proving he did not believe the election was stolen despite being told as much by senior members of his own administration.\n\nIn making its case for a Justice Department prosecution of Trump, the House committee took aim at that possible defense.\n\nIn describing why the committee believes Trump’s conduct meet the prongs of each criminal statute, the summary stresses evidence that Trump had been warned that his schemes were unlawful.\n\nTrump raised about $250 million by crying fraud\n\nThe committee says it gathered evidence indicating that Trump “raised roughly one quarter of a billion dollars in fundraising efforts between the election and January 6th. Those solicitations persistently claimed and referred to election fraud that did not exist.”\n\n“For example, the Trump Campaign, along with the Republican National Committee, sent millions of emails to their supporters, with messaging claiming that the election was ‘rigged,’ that their donations could stop Democrats from ‘trying to steal the election,’ and that Vice President Biden would be an ‘illegitimate president’ if he took office,’” the summary states.\n\nSeveral members of Congress are being referred to the House Ethics Committee\n\nThe select committee is referring several Republican lawmakers who refused to cooperate with the investigation to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona, could all face possible sanctions for their refusal to comply with committee subpoenas.\n\nConcerns about witness credibility and Trump-allied attorneys\n\nThe committee raised concerns that attorneys paid by Trump’s political committee or allied groups were incentivized to protect the former president, saying, “lawyers who are receiving such payments have specific incentives to defend President Trump rather than zealously represent their own clients. The Department of Justice and the Fulton County District Attorney have been provided with certain information related to this topic.”\n\nIn one instance, a witness whose lawyer was being paid by a Trump-allied group was told she could “in certain circumstances, tell the Committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them.” When the witness raised concerns with her lawyer about that approach, the lawyer said, “They don’t know what you know, [witness]. They don’t know that you can recall some of these things. So you saying ‘I don’t recall’ is an entirely acceptable response to this,” according to the report summary.\n\nWhen it came to a specific issue that reflected negatively on Trump, the lawyer told his client, “No, no, no, no, no. We don’t want to go there. We don’t want to talk about that.”\n\nThe committee notes both Trump and his allies attempted to contact witnesses ahead of their committee testimony.\n\n“The Select Committee is aware of multiple efforts by President Trump to contact Select Committee witnesses. The Department of Justice is aware of at least one of those circumstances,” according to the summary.\n\nIvanka Trump and Kayleigh McEnany\n\nThe committee also, in its final report, highlighted two high-profile witnesses – Ivanka Trump and then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany – as being less cooperative than others. They and others “displayed a lack of full recollection of certain issues, or were not otherwise as frank or direct as Cipollone.”\n\nIn another instance, Trump had an angry conversation with Pence in which he referred to the then-vice president as “The P word,” according to a committee interview with Ivanka Trump’s chief of staff, Julie Radford.\n\nIn Radford’s recollection, the name-calling was upsetting to Ivanka at the time, but when the committee asked Ivanka whether there were any “particular words” her father used in the conversation with Pence, “She answered simply: ‘No.’”\n\nThe summary states: “In several circumstances, the Committee has found that less senior White House aides had significantly better recollection of events than senior staff purported to have.”\n\nAs for McEnany, the committee called her testimony “evasive, as if she was testifying from pre-prepared talking points,” noting she was deposed early in the investigation and wasn’t as forthcoming as others from Trump’s press office.\n\nImpropriety by Trump Justice Department officials\n\nThe report points the finger at two Trump appointees at the Justice Department who the committee believes abused their positions and acted unethically.\n\nClark, the former acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Division, is already well known for trying to weaponize the Justice Department to help Trump overturn the 2020 election. The committee raises the prospect that Clark broke the law. The Justice Department is already investigating Clark and federal agents have searched his home.\n\nOne of the most egregious things Clark did was draft a letter for the Justice Department to send to election officials in battleground states, urging them to essentially overturn their results. The letter, crafted with help from fellow Trump appointee Ken Klukowski, falsely asserted that the department believed there were problems with the results.\n\n“This was an intentional choice by Jeff Clark to contradict specific Department findings on election fraud, and purposely insert the Department into the Presidential election on President Trump’s behalf and risk creating or exacerbating a constitutional crisis,” the summary states.\n\nIn a new development, the panel flagged its concerns about Klukowski’s conduct.\n\nHe worked for the Trump campaign before joining the Justice Department during the final weeks of the administration. And while at the department’s civil division, he spent some of his time helping Clark with his attempts to overturn the election, “despite the fact that election-related matters are not part of the Civil portfolio,” the summary says.\n\nTrump and others may try this again, committee warns\n\nThe summary’s section outlining the referrals makes a case for why the Justice Department’s prosecutions should extend beyond the rioters who physically breached the Capitol.\n\nThe committee says that Trump “believed then, and continues to believe now, that he is above the law, not bound by our Constitution and its explicit checks on Presidential authority.”\n\n“If President Trump and the associates who assisted him in an effort to overturn the lawful outcome of the 2020 election are not ultimately held accountable under the law, their behavior may become a precedent and invitation to danger for future elections,” the summary says. “A failure to hold them accountable now may ultimately lead to future unlawful efforts to overturn our elections, thereby threatening the security and viability of our Republic.”\n\nThe summary revisits Trump’s infamous phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where he begged Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to nullify Biden’s victory in the state. The summary also highlights that Trump doxed the leader of the Michigan Senate by tweeting out his cell phone number after he publicly said he wouldn’t undermine the election results.\n\nLawmakers also highlighted the plight of former Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, who previously testified about the abuse they suffered when Giuliani and others in pro-Trump circles falsely accused them of rigging the results in Atlanta.\n\nLike Freeman and Moss, other officials who faced Trump’s ire received death and rape threats and an avalanche of phone calls and emails, and some of them feared for their safety.\n\nPardon requests show that Trump allies knew they were in possible legal jeopardy\n\nThe evidence that Trump allies sought pardons as the administration drew to a close shows that they knew their conduct was legally problematic, the committee argues.\n\nThe summary points to previously public accounts of pardon requests from members of Congress, while providing new details of Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz’s alleged attempt for a pardon, which had been discussed in the public committee testimony of ex-White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nCNN previously reported that the McEntee testimony linked Gaetz’s pardon request to a separate DOJ probe; Hutchinson, however, said Gaetz and others asked “blanket” pardons for participants at a meeting where election-related schemes were discussed.\n\nIntelligence and law enforcement agencies knew of threats of violence on January 6, but information didn’t get through\n\nThe summary of the report lays out how the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies were receiving information that January 6 was likely to be violent and shared that information with the White House and US Secret Service.\n\nFor example, on January 3, 2021, Department of Justice officials received an intelligence summary of plans to “occupy the Capitol” and “invade” the Capitol on January 6. According to testimony from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist predicted on a National Security Council call that the Capitol could be the target of violence.\n\n“I’ll never forget it,” Milley said in testimony revealed by the committee.\n\nIn pictures: The January 6 hearings\n\nThe panel suggests former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato failed to adequately serve as the intermediary between the intelligence community and the White House when it came to security updates ahead of January 6.\n\n“Ornato had access to intelligence that suggested violence at the Capitol on January 6th, and it was his job to inform Meadows and Trump of that. Although Ornato told us that he did not recall doing so, the Select Committee found multiple parts of Ornato’s testimony questionable,” the panel wrote.\n\nThe head of Trump’s security detail, Bobby Engel, testified to the committee that he shared critical information with Ornato as a means to convey messages to the White House.\n\nOrnato confirmed Engel’s understanding of information sharing, but when pressed on whether he talked to Meadows about concerns of the threat landscape going into January 6 said, “I don’t recall; however, in my position I would’ve made sure he was tracking the demos, which he received a daily brief, Presidential briefing. So he most likely was getting all this in his daily brief as well.”\n\nAides urged Trump to call for peaceful protests\n\nStaffers close to Trump told the committee they tried to get the then-president to act preemptively to quell concerns about January 6.\n\nHope Hicks, Trump’s former communications director, texted spokesman Hogan Gidley as the violence was unfolding on January 6 that she had “suggested…several times” on January 4 and 5 that Trump should publicly state that January 6 remain peaceful. Hicks also testified that Herschmann advised Trump to make a preemptive public statement ahead of January 6 calling for there to be no violence that day. No such statement was ever made.\n\nBy the time of Trump’s rally on January 6, the committee says testimony it received indicates that the former president had received a security briefing and that the Secret Service mentioned that there were prohibited items being confiscated from individuals trying to attend.\n\nMotorcade incident proves Trump’s intent to participate in overturning the election\n\nThe committee highlights Trump’s frustration with not being taken to the Capitol on January 6 as evidence that he intended to participate in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“The Committee’s principal concern was that the President actually intended to participate personally in the January 6th efforts at the Capitol, leading the attempt to overturn the election either from inside the House Chamber, from a stage outside the Capitol, or otherwise,” the summary of the report reads. “There is no question from all the evidence assembled that President Trump did have that intent.”\n\nThe report details that the panel was ultimately unable to get Ornato to corroborate a bombshell moment during the public hearings, in which Hutchinson recalled Ornato describing Trump’s altercation with the head of his security detail when he was told he would not be taken to the Capitol. The committee summary said both Hutchinson and a White House employee testified to the committee about the Ornato conversation. But “Ornato professed that he did not recall either communication, and that he had no knowledge at all about the President’s anger.”\n\nUltimately, the committee writes that it “has significant concerns about the credibility of this testimony” and vows to release his transcript publicly. Ornato did not recall conveying the information to Hutchinson or a White House employee with national security responsibilities, according to the report.\n\n“The Committee is skeptical of Ornato’s account.”\n\nThe panel writes that it has obtained evidence from “several sources about a ‘furious interaction’ in the SUV.” The panel cites multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police and national security officials in the White House who described Trump’s behavior as “irate,” “furious,” “insistent,” “profane” and “heated.”\n\nThe driver of Trump’s motorcade on January 6 testified to the committee:\n\nTrump’s former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump continued to push to travel to the Capitol even after he returned to the White House.\n\n“So to the best of my recollection, I recall him being – wanting to saying that he wanted to physically walk and be a part of the march and then saying that he would ride the Beast if he needed to, ride in the Presidential limo,” McEnany said.\n\nAnother intent the committee’s report summary seeks to prove is that Trump’s call to his supporters to go the Capitol during his rally speech was pre-planned.\n\nFor example, the committee notes that January 6 rally organizer Kylie Kremer texted MyPIllow CEO Mike Lindell, “This stays only between us. … It can also not get out about the march because I will be in trouble with the national park service and all the agencies but POTUS is going to just call for it ‘unexpectedly.’”\n\nTrump refused to act as riot unfolded\n\nThe committee lays out Trump’s failure to act as the riot unfolded, noting that as he watched the riot on television, he made no calls for security assistance and resisted efforts from staffers asking him to call off his supporters.\n\n“President Trump did not contact a single top national security official during the day. Not at the Pentagon, nor at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., the Capitol Police Department, or the D.C. Mayor’s office,” the committee writes. “As Vice President Pence has confirmed, President Trump didn’t even try to reach his own Vice President to make sure that Pence was safe.”\n\nMilley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee he had this reaction to Trump, “You know, you’re the Commander in Chief. You’ve got an assault going on on the Capitol of the United States of America. And there’s nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?”\n\nTrump did, however, take the time to reach out to his attorney.\n\nWhite House staffers, meantime, described being appalled that as the Capitol was under attack, Trump fired off a tweet criticizing Pence.\n\nHicks texted a colleague that night to say, “Attacking the VP? Wtf is wrong with him,” according to the committee’s summary report.\n\n“No photographs exist of the President for the remainder of the afternoon until after 4 p.m. President Trump appears to have instructed that the White House photographer was not to take any photographs,” the committee writes, citing testimony from former White House photographer Shealah Craighead.\n\nIn the aftermath, on the evening of January 6, Trump’s former campaign manager Brad Parscale told Katrina Pierson, one of the rally organizers, that that he felt guilty helping Trump win, the report states..\n\nThe events of the day, Parscale said, resulted from “a sitting president asking for civil war.”\n\nGOP lawmakers called for help\n\nThe committee also highlights real-time reactions from Republican members of Congress who have since downplayed the Capitol attack or defended Trump.\n\nTrump’s son-in-law and former White House senior adviser Jared Kushner described House GOP leader McCarthy as “scared” as McCarthy reached out to members of Trump’s family for help during the riot.\n\nIn a text to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote, “Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything,” according to the summary.\n\nTrump’s reaction upon finding out the Capitol had been attacked: ‘Oh really?’\n\nThe committee reveals a conversation Trump had with a White House employee upon returning to the White House after his speech on January 6. Trump’s actions and conversations from when he returned to the White House to when he called off the rioters, referred to famously as the 187 minutes, continues to have huge gaps of information.\n\nHe asked the White House employee – whose identity the panel kept anonymous “to guard against the risk of retaliation” – if they had watched his rally speech on television. The White House employee responded, “Sir, they cut it off because they’re rioting down at the Capitol.”\n\nWhen Trump asked what they meant, the employee repeated:\n\nThe summary acknowledges the roadblocks the House committee ran into in its investigation and says the Justice Department has the tools – such as grand jury subpoena power – to knock down those obstacles.\n\nThe summary also notes the invocations of privilege made by former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone that prevented the committee from learning details about direct conversations with Trump. But the panels appears optimistic that a recent, under-seal court victory the DOJ secured will allow prosecutors to obtain that testimony from Cipollone.\n\n“Based on the information it has obtained, the Committee believes that Cipollone and others can provide direct testimony establishing that President Trump refused repeatedly, for multiple hours, to make a public statement directing his violent and lawless supporters to leave the Capitol,” the summary says.\n\nMore than 30 witnesses before the select committee exercised their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused, on that basis, to provide testimony. They included individuals central to the investigation, such as Eastman, Clark, Chesebro, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn and others.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/jan-6-final-report-findings/', 'Headline': 'Key findings from the Jan. 6 committee’s final report', 'Snippet': 'Shortly after Jan. 6, 2021, and amid Trump’s impeachment, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) relayed that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had said Trump told McCarthy during ...', 'Full_text': '1. ‘Potus im sure is loving this’: Mid-riot text adds to suggestions of Trump’s approval\n\nThe committee has focused extensively on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction as the riot was taking place. But it has occasionally suggested that he might have approved of what was happening or at least seen some political upside in it.\n\nAnd the final report contains more grist for that mill: One of the most striking new revelations is a text message from a Trump aide, Robert Gabriel. At 2:49 p.m., as the Capitol was under siege, Gabriel texted, “Potus im sure is loving this.”\n\nThe text builds upon previously known evidence.\n\nShortly after Jan. 6, 2021, and amid Trump’s impeachment, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) relayed that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had said Trump told McCarthy during the riot, “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”\n\nWhite House aide Sarah Matthews has said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her that Trump resisted calling on the rioters to be “peaceful” in a tweet. (In texts from the time and in later testimony to the committee, Trump aide Hope Hicks also said that, before Jan. 6, both she and White House lawyer Eric Herschmann called for Trump to preemptively urge peacefulness, but that Trump “refused.”)\n\nWhite House aide Cassidy Hutchinson has also testified that, amid a frantic effort to get Trump to act, she overheard chief of staff Mark Meadows telling White House counsel Pat Cipollone, “He doesn’t want to do anything, Pat.”\n\nThe committee pressed Cipollone on whether Trump actually wanted people to leave the Capitol. Cipollone had said he couldn’t think of anyone on staff who didn’t want the rioters to leave. But when asked whether Trump shared in that opinion, Cipollone struggled with the question and ultimately punted, saying he couldn’t “reveal communications” with Trump, citing executive privilege.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. New details on the ‘fake elector’ plot\n\nOne of the committee’s criminal referrals hones in on the effort to appoint alternate Trump electors (also known as “fake electors”) in key states. And a key question has been: What was the intent behind their appointment?\n\nThe Trump campaign pitched these electors as just a contingency — i.e., they needed to be in place by the Dec. 14 deadline, just in case a given state changed course and declared Trump the winner of their electoral votes. But there has been evidence that some of the architects of the plot planned to deploy the electors regardless, in a much more desperate and forceful ploy to overturn legitimate election results.\n\nSome of the fake electors were apparently concerned about the strategy, or even saw something unsavory ahead. In newly revealed evidence, Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt texted his party’s executive director in late November and said, “I hope they are not planning on asking us to do anything like try and say we are only the proper electors.” He added on Dec. 12 after receiving a message about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani: “These guys are up to no good and its gonna fail miserably.” Hitt signed on as a Trump elector anyway.\n\nOther electors clearly worried about legal liability, insisting (in New Mexico and Pennsylvania) that the documents listing them specify that they were only legitimate if their states’ election results were overturned. But most documents made no such distinction.\n\nThe committee also detailed new evidence linking Giuliani, Trump and Meadows to the early fake-elector effort. Trump campaign lawyer Joshua Findlay testified that “it was my understanding that the President made” the decision to have someone look into the feasibility of appointing alternative electors around Dec. 7 or 8.\n\n3. Some notable recommendations — including on 14th Amendment\n\nOn Monday, the committee took the historic step of referring Trump and others to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. But the report features some other recommendations, including one that had been floated after Jan. 6: possibly disqualifying Trump and others from holding office.\n\nThe 14th Amendment of the Constitution says that anyone who has “engaged in an insurrection” or given “aid or comfort to the enemies” of the United States can be barred from holding office. (This law has been invoked in unsuccessful efforts to bar some GOP lawmakers like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from office.)\n\nTrump’s second impeachment featured a historic number of members of the president’s own party voting in favor. And some Democrats and watchdogs continue to argue for Trump to be barred from office. But with Republicans taking over the House in early January — and even Democrats generally having shown little appetite for this step before — it appears unlikely Congress will take up this proposal.\n\nThe report also advises that congressional committees look into media and social media companies whose policies have “have had the effect of radicalizing their consumers, including by provoking people to attack their own country.” And it recommends possible safeguards against a president misusing the Insurrection Act, which some Trump allies floated.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. It suggests Trump defamed Dominion\n\nSome have questioned why, though Fox News and others have found themselves under legal scrutiny, Trump himself isn’t the focus of high-profile lawsuits aimed at those who spread lies and misinformation about voting machines. (Legal experts disagree on the strength of the potential legal case a plaintiff would have against him.)\n\nThe report lays out how Trump was repeatedly told what he was saying about Dominion voting machines was false, even as he continued to spout the claims. And it suggests Trump meets the test for defaming Dominion.\n\n“President Trump’s own campaign staff, administration officials, and State officials, all told him the claims had no merit. Hand recounts confirmed the fidelity of the machines,"" the report says. ""But none of this overwhelming evidence mattered. President Trump demonstrated a conscious disregard for the facts and continued to maliciously smear Dominion.”\n\nThe language here is deliberate: Legally speaking, the “actual malice” standard for defamation requires proving that the person either knew what they were saying was false or showed a reckless disregard for whether it were true.\n\nThe report highlights previously known evidence about the various advisors and government officials who either tried to dissuade Trump from this theory, or knew that others had. It also added a new name this week: White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who confirmed she had tried unsuccessfully to wave Trump off the theory.\n\nIn a transcript released Thursday, White House press aide Sarah Matthews also testified that McEnany “actively” resisted Trump’s attempts to get her to bring up the conspiracy theory in media interviews and hold White House briefings on the subject.\n\n5. The extent of Trump’s pressure campaign in key states\n\nWe’ve known that Trump and his allies pressured lawmakers and officials far and wide to help overturn the election results in key states. But the report lays out the vast scale of this effort.\n\nIt says, “President Trump or his inner circle engaged in at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation, targeting either State legislators or State or local election administrators, to overturn State election results.”\n\nWhat qualifies as “targeting” an official is, of course, subjective. But several officials indicate they felt the pressure.\n\nThen-Michigan state House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R) said he received between five and 10 phone calls from Trump after the election. Chatfield said he repeatedly informed Trump he had seen nothing that would overturn Trump’s nearly three-point deficit in the state, and he and state Senate President Mike Shirkey (R) put out a statement saying as much after a meeting with Trump.\n\nBut the Trump campaign on Jan. 3 tweeted that people should contact Chatfield or the GOP leader of the state Senate, Mike Shirkey, to “Demand [a] vote on decertification."" Trump’s social media team promoted Shirkey’s personal cell phone number and a number for Chatfield that turned out to be wrong. Shirkey said he received 4,000 text messages. Chatfield testified, ""I and my family have received numerous threats, along with members on both sides of the aisle.”\n\nThe report details dozens of officials who were threatened, though not all were targeted by Trump personally. The chairman of the Maricopa County, Ariz., board of supervisors, Clint Hickman (R), said “the threats never abated.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Little focus on security issues, while mostly blaming Trump\n\nThe Washington Post reported in November that some committee members and staffers on the Jan. 6 committee were upset that Vice Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) wanted the report to focus so extensively on Trump. Well, the final product appears to reflect Cheney’s desires.\n\nThe report says relatively little about the security failures that had been the focus of some congressional probing. It mostly relegates those findings to the first appendix — about 30 pages long — near the end of the report. For example, it does little to reconcile conflicting timelines presented by key officials when it comes to when the National Guard was requested and approved.\n\nBut the verdict is rather damning, saying these failures also put lives in danger.\n\nThe report says that, before Jan. 6, both federal and local law enforcement had intelligence predicting violence that day. “Although some of that intelligence was fragmentary, it should have been sufficient to warrant far more vigorous preparations for the security of the joint session.” the report says. “The failure to sufficiently share and act upon that intelligence jeopardized the lives of the police officers defending the Capitol and everyone in it.”\n\nIn the next breath, though, the report emphasizes Trump’s culpability and says that better planning might not have been able to account for the violence he would stoke.\n\n7. The full picture of an allegedly corrupt plot\n\nThe chief alleged crime the committee has focused on is what’s known as obstruction of an official proceeding — in this case, Congress’s counting of electoral votes on Jan. 6. And showing that requires proving Trump acted corruptly.\n\nGiven that, it’s worth running through all the evidence — most of it previously established, but some new — that this plot was corrupt. The committee has keyed on a few things: that Trump was told his voter-fraud theories were false, that he actually knew he had lost the 2020 election, and that the participants in the plot knew it was illegal.\n\nIn addition to the previously-known figures who said they pushed back on Trump’s theories internally, the committee revealed this week that White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien testified about a Dec. 18 Oval Office phone call in which he said that there was no evidence of fraud using voting machines or foreign interference. Cipollone also testified that the lack of sufficient evidence was made clear internally “over and over again.”\n\nIncluding an official in Raffensperger’s office, the report details at least eight officials testifying that Trump and his team were informed his theories were false.\n\nAs for Trump admitting he lost: Hutchinson and another former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin have both said they heard about Trump doing so. And in a transcript released this week, Hutchinson said she asked Meadows, point blank, whether Trump knew he lost. According to Hutchinson, Meadows “said something to the effect of, ‘he knows it’s over. He knows he lost. But we are going to keep trying. There’s a chance he didn’t lose. I want to pull this off for him.”\n\nPrevious evidence also showed some of those involved admitted their plot was illegal or might not pass legal muster. That includes contemporaneous documents from Eastman, and testimony from Pence aide Greg Jacob and White House lawyer Eric Herschmann about their interactions with Eastman, and Giuliani, respectively, who they said admitted their case would lose in court. And in October, a judge ruled that Trump had knowingly signed a verification containing false voter-fraud figures that Eastman had admitted were wrong.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. What the report doesn’t shed light on\n\nThe scale of the investigation was massive, and many witnesses weren’t particularly forthcoming, repeatedly invoking their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination or, in some cases, not testifying at all. That means that some of the angles probed by the committee remain unresolved or disputed. Among them:\n\n- The committee didn’t resolve what happened in the presidential vehicle after Trump’s speech. Hutchinson had testified that White House aide Anthony M. Ornato told her that Trump became irate and lunged at the head of his Secret Service detail, Bobby Engel, when Engel wouldn’t bring him to the Capitol. (She emphasized that her account was secondhand.) Ornato said he didn’t recall conveying that information to Hutchinson, according to the committee. The committee confirmed with other witnesses that Trump was angry, but they did not confirm a physical altercation. In the end, the report says it was “difficult to fully reconcile the accounts of several of the witnesses who provided information with what we heard from Engel and Ornato.”\n\n- Some congressional Democrats suggested shortly after Jan. 6 that certain Republicans provided reconnaissance tours to rioters before Jan. 6. And more specifically, the committee raised questions about a tour Rep. Barry Loudermilk(R-Ga.) led on Jan. 5, which Loudermilk struggled to explain. But the report doesn’t dwell upon this at all. It merely mentions that one of Loudermilk’s guests who was captured on video at Trump’s speech on Jan. 6 “took pictures of hallways and staircases,” which was previously known.\n\n- Hutchinson testified that Trump was told people at his speech were found with weapons but was unconcerned — and even asked that security stop using magnetometers. This is a key piece of evidence, since Trump would later direct these people to the Capitol. Hutchinson said Trump justified his lack of concern by saying, “They’re not here to hurt me.” The report doesn’t confirm that Trump was told about the weapons, but it does say Engel recalled Trump making a similar comment, as Trump was trying to persuade Engel to take him to the Capitol.\n\ncorrection\n\nAn earlier version of this story stated that it had been more than a century since the 14th Amendment was used to bar someone from public office. In September, a New Mexico judge used it to disqualify an Otero County commissioner. This story has been updated.'}}",100.0,2

Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides ...', 'Full_text': 'In a prime-time speech to the nation, President Joe Biden spoke about gun violence and his proposals to reduce it. Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/politics/biden-signs-gun-bill/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden signs bipartisan gun safety bill into law: ‘God willing, it’s ...', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious policy issues in Washington.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he finished signing the bill.\n\nThe legislation came together in the aftermath of recent mass shootings at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school and a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nraila.org/articles/20231204/nbc-poll-majority-of-voter-households-own-firearms', 'Headline': 'NBC Poll: Majority of Voter Households Own Firearms - NRA-ILA', 'Snippet': 'Even better, on November 21 NBC News published a piece titled, “ Poll: Gun ownership reaches record high with American electorate.”. According to the article, “More than half of American ...', 'Full_text': 'The last few weeks haven’t been kind to gun grabbers - and we’re not just talking about President Joe Biden’s woeful poll numbers. Black Friday is typically the largest day of the year for gun sales. This year, gun buyers set a record for FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) checks on the unofficial holiday. Even better, on November 21 NBC News published a piece titled, “Poll: Gun ownership reaches record high with American electorate.”\n\nAccording to the article, “More than half of American voters -- 52% -- say they or someone in their household owns a gun, per the latest NBC News national poll.” The item went on to explain, “That\'s the highest share of voters who say that they or someone in their household owns a gun in the history of the NBC News poll, on a question dating back to 1999.”\n\nMoreover, this widespread gun ownership crosses the political divide. 45 percent of independents reported that they or someone in their household owns a firearm, while 41 percent of Democrats confirmed the same. America’s burgeoning firearm-owning households are also diverse. The NBC piece reported that 41 percent of Black respondents reported living in a gun-owning household, which is “a 17-point increase among that group in just four years.”\n\nMicah Roberts of Public Opinion Strategies, who helped conduct the poll, told NBC News, “In the last ten years, we\'ve grown [10 points] in gun ownership. That\'s a very stunning number."" As shocking as some might find that figure, there is good reason to believe that the number of gun owner households is far higher than the poll reported.\n\nConsider a June 2023 study published in the journal Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, titled, “Predicting potential underreporting of firearm ownership in a nationally representative sample.”\n\nSummarizing the article for Reason magazine, J.D. Tucille explained that the researchers used data gleaned from known gun owners to build profiles of likely gun owners. Then,\n\nthey then applied the profiles across their sample of 3,500 respondents to estimate who was likely fibbing about not owning guns. The results depend on the probability threshold applied, but they came up with 1,206 confirmed owners, between 1,243 and 2,059 non-owners, and between 220 and 1,036 potential but secretive owners lying about their status.\n\nThese findings suggest that there could be between 18 to 86 percent more gun owners than is typically reported. The high end of the estimate would suggest an over 60 percent gun ownership rate.\n\nSimilarly, Wake Forest Professor of Sociology David Yamane believes that polling systematically underestimates gun ownership. In a 2019 piece titled “Why Surveys Underestimate Gun Ownership Rates in the U.S.,” Yamane laid out the case for systematic underreporting and provided a bevy of reasons why gun owners would be reluctant to be truthful with pollsters. The professor noted, “My educated guess is that the underestimate is at least 10%, that 25% would not be an unreasonable amount, and more than 25% is likely.”\n\nWhatever the true gun ownership rate, these recent findings are great news for gun owners and terrible news for gun prohibitionists. For decades gun control backers have perpetuated the myth that gun ownership is falling, against the best available evidence to the contrary, to try to get politicians to do their bidding. Readers can decide whether this anti-gun gambit was fueled more by self-delusion or intentional fraud. Politicians will need to decide whether to indulge these charlatans or respect the fundamental rights of the majority of voting households.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nraila.org/articles/20230315/bidens-executive-order-targeting-gun-ownership', 'Headline': 'Biden’s Executive Order Targeting Gun Ownership - NRA-ILA', 'Snippet': 'Wednesday, March 15, 2023. On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep. Media and gun control groups that ...', 'Full_text': 'On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nMedia and gun control groups that beforehand had been salivating over the idea that the measure would impose “universal background checks” for firearm transfers had to content themselves with a vague directive for Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop a “plan” to move in that direction.\n\nAnd while the order’s other provisions were similarly vague and insubstantial, there is no doubt what it all adds up to: antagonism toward gun ownership is now the official policy of the U.S. government’s Executive Branch.\n\nThe good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done. Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them. Stay tuned to this page for details on what that looks like as the federal departments mobilize against the Second Amendment in the months ahead.

Policy. Every few days in the United States, we mourn a new mass shooting. Daily acts of gun violence — including community violence, domestic violence, suicide, and accidental shootings — may not always make the evening news, but they too cut lives short and leave survivors and their communities with long-lasting physical and mental wounds. We cannot accept these facts as the enduring reality of life in America. Instead, we must together insist that we have had enough, and that we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation.\n\nIt is the policy of my Administration that executive departments and agencies (agencies) will pursue every legally available and appropriate action to reduce gun violence. Through this whole-of-government approach, my Administration has made historic progress to save lives. My Administration has taken action to keep guns out of dangerous hands and especially dangerous weapons off of our streets; hold gun traffickers and rogue gun dealers accountable; fund accountable, effective community policing; and invest in community violence interventions and prevention strategies.\n\nLast year, I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (the “Act”), the most significant bipartisan gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. The Act provides communities with new tools to combat gun violence, including enhanced gun background checks for individuals under age 21, funding for extreme risk protection orders and other crisis interventions, and increased mental health resources to help children impacted by gun violence heal from the resulting grief and trauma.\n\nI continue to call on the Congress to take additional action to reduce gun violence, including by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring background checks for all gun sales, requiring safe storage of firearms, funding my comprehensive Safer America Plan, and expanding community violence intervention and prevention strategies. In the meantime, my Administration will continue to do all that we can, within existing authority, to make our communities safer.\n\nSec. 2. Implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall each submit a report to the President within 60 days of the date of this order describing what actions their respective agencies have taken to implement the Act, data and analysis regarding the use and early effects of the Act, and additional steps their respective agencies will take to maximize the benefits of the Act. These reports shall include a plan for increasing public awareness and use of resources made available by the Act.\n\nSec. 3. Additional Agency Actions to Reduce Gun Violence. (a) The Attorney General shall develop and implement a plan to:\n\n(i) clarify the definition of who is engaged in the business of dealing in firearms, and thus required to become Federal firearms licensees (FFLs), in order to increase compliance with the Federal background check requirement for firearm sales, including by considering a rulemaking, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law;\n\n(ii) prevent former FFLs whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered from continuing to engage in the business of dealing in firearms;\n\n(iii) publicly release, to the fullest extent permissible by law, inspection reports of FFL dealers cited for violations of the law; and\n\n(iv) support efforts to modernize and make permanent the Undetectable Firearms Act (18 U.S.C. 922(p)).\n\n(b) The Secretary of Defense; the Attorney General; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; the Secretary of Education; and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall expand existing Federal campaigns and other efforts to promote safe storage of firearms.\n\n(c) The Secretary of Defense; the Attorney General; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; and the Secretary of Education shall undertake efforts to encourage effective use of extreme risk protection orders (“red flag” laws), partnering with law enforcement, health care providers, educators, and other community leaders.\n\n(d) The Attorney General; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; the Secretary of Education; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall develop a proposal for the President, and submit it no later than September 15, 2023, on how the Federal Government can better support the recovery, mental health, and other needs of survivors of gun violence, families of victims and survivors of gun violence, first responders to incidents of gun violence, and communities affected by gun violence. The proposal should draw on existing evidence, where available, and take into account how to address needs in both the immediate aftermath of mass shootings and in the years following such events. The proposal should recommend any additional executive branch coordination and additional resources or authorities from the Congress needed to implement the proposal, as well as how agencies will assess the outcomes for the activities implemented.\n\n(e) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop and implement principles to further firearm and public safety practices through the Department of Defense’s acquisition of firearms, consistent with applicable law.\n\n(f) The heads of Federal law enforcement agencies shall, as soon as practicable, but no later than 180 days from the date of this order, ensure that their respective law enforcement components issue National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) submission and utilization policies with requirements that are equivalent to, or exceed, the requirements of the policy issued by the Department of Justice on December 12, 2022, to ensure the prompt entry of ballistics data recovered in connection with criminal investigations into NIBIN. In consultation with the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense policies may be tailored to address specific operational considerations.\n\n(g) The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Justice, shall work to reduce the loss or theft of firearms during shipment between FFLs and to improve reporting of such losses or thefts, including by engaging with carriers and shippers.\n\n(h) The Federal Trade Commission is encouraged to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers market firearms to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.\n\nSec. 4. Definitions. For purposes of this order, the term “Federal law enforcement agency” means an organizational unit or subunit of the executive branch that employs officers who are authorized to make arrests and carry firearms, and that is responsible for the prevention, detection, and investigation of crime or the apprehension of alleged offenders. The term “heads of Federal law enforcement agencies” means the heads of those units or subunits.\n\nSec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nJOSEPH R.

The third count alleges he possessed a firearm while using a narcotic.\n\nTwo of the charges carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, while the third carries a maximum sentence of five years. Former federal prosecutors have told NBC News those type of charges are rarely brought as standalone charges against defendants without a criminal record.\n\nIn July, Hunter Biden struck a plea agreement with prosecutors that would have made the gun case against him go away in two years if he stayed out of trouble and agreed to never again buy a firearm, but negotiations broke down in August before it was finalized.\n\nAccording to a court filing in that case, Biden was using crack cocaine during the period when he bought the revolver from a federally licensed firearms dealer in Delaware in October 2018, and denied he was using drugs on the federal form.\n\nHe wound up possessing the gun for 11 days, and during that time “he purchased and used crack cocaine regularly,” the filing said. The gun was later found in his car along with drug paraphernalia, and was “subsequently discarded in a trashcan outside a supermarket in Greenville, Delaware,” it said.\n\nNow Hunter Biden\'s defense may align with the Second Amendment advocates\' goals — and against his father\'s calls for tougher gun laws.\n\nHis attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement Thursday he plans on challenging the constitutionality of the laws Hunter Biden is charged with breaking, noting ""recent rulings by several federal courts that this statute is unconstitutional.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61777310', 'Headline': 'US gun control: Cross-party group of senators agree limited ... - BBC', 'Snippet': 'Crucially, the proposals are supported by 10 Republicans, meaning they have the numbers to be voted into law.

Today, the President is celebrating the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun violence reduction legislation to pass Congress in 30 years.\n\nThe Biden Administration will continue to use all of the tools at its disposal to address the epidemic of gun violence. The President’s FY 2023 budget proposes $32 billion in additional funding to fight crime, including $20.6 billion in discretionary funding for federal law enforcement and state and local law enforcement and crime prevention programs, an increase of 11% over FY22 enacted ($18.6 billion) and 18% over FY21 enacted ($17.5 billion).\n\nBut there is so much more that can and must be done to save lives. The President will continue to urge Congress to take further legislative action to keep dangerous guns out of dangerous hands, including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, strengthening background checks, and enacting safe storage laws.\n\nBelow are 21 ways the Biden Administration has already used executive action to make our communities safer:\n\nKeeping Especially Dangerous Weapons and Repeat Shooters Off Our Streets\n\n1. The Justice Department issued a final rule to rein in the proliferation of ghost guns, which are unserialized, privately made firearms that are increasingly being recovered at crime scenes.\n\n2. The Attorney General directed every U.S. Attorney’s Office nationwide to increase resources dedicated to district specific violent crime strategies.\n\n3. The Justice Department issued a proposed rule to better regulate when devices marketed as firearm stabilizing braces effectively turn pistols into short-barreled rifles subject to the National Firearms Act.\n\nKeeping Guns Out of the Wrong Hands\n\n4. The Justice Department published model extreme risk protection order legislation to make it easier for states that want to adopt these red flag laws to do so.\n\n5. The Justice Department issued the first volume of its new, comprehensive report on firearms commerce and trafficking.\n\n6. The Justice Department announced a new policy to underscore zero tolerance for willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk.\n\n7. The Justice Department launched five new law enforcement strike forces focused on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Washington, D.C.\n\n8. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) launched a new paid media campaign featuring a series of public service announcements to reinforce the key message that a simple gun lock can save lives.\n\n9. The Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as the Office of Emergency Medical Services within the Department of Transportation (DOT), announced that they will jointly create a plan for addressing lethal means safety awareness, education, training, and program evaluation.\n\n10. ATF issued a final rule clarifying firearms dealers’ statutory obligations to make available for purchase compatible secure gun storage or safety devices.\n\nMaking Additional Progress to Reduce Community Violence\n\n11. The President called for cities and states to use American Rescue Plan funding to reduce gun crime and other violent crime, including by investing in community violence interventions and prevention. Through May 2022, $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funds had been committed to public safety and violence prevention – including at least $6.5 billion in State and Local funds committed by more than half of states and more than 300 communities across the country\n\n12. Five federal agencies made changes to 26 different programs to direct vital support to community violence intervention programs as quickly as possible. For example\n\n• The National Institutes of Health announced funding through its Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research grants for four community violence programs – including a place-based strategy involving repurposing vacant lots in Detroit, an evaluation of READI Chicago, a burnout prevention program for violence interrupters in Chicago, and a hospital-based violence intervention program focused on youth in Virginia.\n\n• The Justice Department announced $187 million for states and $85 million for localities through the Byrne JAG Program to support coordinated violence prevention and intervention; the Department explicitly encouraged the use of these funds for CVI.\n\n• The Department of Housing and Urban Development published a guide explaining to localities how Community Development Block Grants – a $3.4 billion annual funding stream –can be used to fund CVI strategies.\n\n• The Department of Education released a letter to state school associations on how 21st Century Learning Centers funds and Student Support and Academic enrichment programs – both billion-dollar formula grant funding streams – can be used to fund CVI strategies in schools.\n\n13. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services hosted a webinar and published information to educate states on how they can use Medicaid to reimburse certain community violence intervention programs, like Hospital-Based Violence Interventions. Last year, Connecticut and Illinois enacted legislation that allows Medicaid to reimburse providers for hospital-based violence prevention services – the first two states in the country to pursue this approach. According to reporting by USA Today, “[t]he idea has been in the works for years, advocates say, but not until the Biden administration signaled that states could – and should – use Medicaid dollars to support these violence prevention programs have state lawmakers stepped up.”\n\n14. Senior White House staff established The White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, a 16-jurisdiction cohort of mayors, law enforcement, CVI experts, and philanthropic leaders committed to using American Rescue Plan funding or other public funding to increase investment in their community violence intervention infrastructure.\n\nProviding Law Enforcement with the Tools and Resources They Need to Reduce Gun Violence\n\n15. The Justice Department announced $139 million in grants to local law enforcement that will put over 1,000 police officers on the beat through the COPS Office Hiring Program.\n\n16. The Justice Department’s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) expanded the Domestic Violence Homicide Prevention Firearms Technical Assistance Project (FTAP).\n\nAddressing the Root Causes of Gun Violence\n\n17. The Department of Labor awarded $89 million through its YouthBuild program to provide pre-apprenticeship opportunities for young people ages 16-24.\n\n18. The Department of Labor awarded $20 million through its Workforce Pathways for Youth program to expand workforce development activities that serve youth ages 14-21 during “out of school” time (non-school hours).\n\n19. The Department of Labor awarded $85.5 million to help formerly incarcerated adults and young people in 28 communities transition out of the criminal justice system and connect with quality jobs.\n\n20. The Department of Labor awarded $25.5 million in Young Adult Reentry Partnership grants to organizations that will help provide education and training services to young adults between 18-24 who were previously involved with the justice system or who left high school before graduation.\n\n21. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Family Violence Prevention and Services Program, awarded nearly $1 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) supplemental funding to support services for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and their children.\n\n###'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/us/politics/gun-control-bill-biden.html', 'Headline': 'Biden Signs Bipartisan Gun Bill Into Law - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'After 20 children were shot and killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, Mr. Biden, the vice president at the time, was tasked by President Barack Obama with drafting a list of executive actions on guns ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — President Biden on Saturday signed into law a bipartisan gun bill intended to prevent dangerous people from accessing firearms and increase investments in the nation’s mental health system, ending nearly three decades of gridlock in Washington over how to address gun violence in the United States.\n\nFinal passage of the legislation in Congress came one month after a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, left 19 children and two teachers dead, a horror that galvanized a bipartisan group of lawmakers to strike a narrow compromise.\n\n“God willing,” Mr. Biden said as he put his pen down on Saturday morning, “it’s going to save a lot of lives.”\n\nThe president acknowledged that the legislation fell far short of the sweeping measures he had pushed for, but he said it included some long-sought priorities.\n\n“When it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential,” Mr. Biden said.\n\nFor lawmakers, advocates and survivors of gun violence, the law is the culmination of decades of work, building on repeated failed efforts to overcome Republican opposition and overhaul the nation’s gun laws in response to mass shootings across the country.

The office will also seek to identify more executive actions the president can take. Biden noted that he would continue to urge Congress to take legislative action on banning assault weapons and implementing universal background checks. Until then, he said the White House and activists will move forward with or without them.\n\nThere have been more than 500 mass shootings in 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive, and more than 30,000 firearm-related deaths. Gun violence deaths among teens and children also rose an alarming 50 percent between 2019 and 2021 to become the leading cause of death for children in the United States.\n\nStefanie Feldman, an aide to President Biden who’s been working on gun safety policy with him for over a decade, will be the director of the new office. In an interview with Vox, she said that the office is meant to implement the laws and policies passed during Biden’s tenure, including the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the president’s executive actions on gun violence. “The president wants to make sure we get it done right.” She also reiterated the message that the president and vice president would urge but not wait on Congress to pass new laws.\n\nCurrently, multiple government agencies are involved in efforts to reduce gun violence, including the Department of Justice, which gives grants to communities working to prevent gun violence; the Department of Health and Human Services, which funds research studying gun violence as a health epidemic; the FBI, which runs criminal background checks; and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which enforces national gun laws and regulates firearms sales. The White House, its gun reform allies in Congress, and advocates have been coordinating with one another for years. This office puts all of those efforts under one roof, with a dedicated leadership team inside the executive branch.\n\nLeading the effort will be Vice President Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor who has worked on gun safety issues during her time in the White House. At the ceremony, Harris drew on her past experiences as a prosecutor in making a case for the office. “I’ve seen with my own eyes what a bullet does to the human body,” she said. “We cannot normalize any of this.”\n\nTwo prominent activists in the gun violence prevention movement, Greg Jackson, executive director of the Community Access Justice Fund, and Rob Wilcox, former senior director of federal and government affairs at Everytown for Gun Safety, will serve as deputy directors. Both have a personal connection to their work: Wilcox lost a family member to gun violence, and Jackson was shot and seriously injured in Washington, DC, in 2013.\n\nGun violence reformers have been pushing the Biden administration to create a special office since at least the beginning of his tenure. The creation of a task force inside the White House was one of the primary recommendations from the Center for American Progress and Giffords, the gun violence reform group headed by former Congress member and gun violence survivor Gabrielle Giffords. She revealed that she also wrote a letter to the then-president-elect about creating a task force. Giffords acknowledged that the scourge of gun violence wouldn’t be resolved overnight, “but every step forward will save lives — and today’s announcement is a giant step forward,” she wrote.\n\nThe president’s move was praised by leaders across a wide range of disciplines. “It really speaks to the gravity of the issue,” Chethan Sathya, a pediatric trauma surgeon who leads Northwell Health’s gun violence prevention center, told Vox. “This is one of our chief public health crises, a main killer of kids in this country. We need folks singularly focused on this issue.”\n\nLucy McBath, a Democratic Georgia Congress member whose son, Jordan Davis, was murdered in 2012, also appeared at the White House press briefing Friday. “Nobody wants to experience what I have, but my story is becoming far too common in the United States,” McBath said. Biden, she said, “is taking decisive action by declaring loudly and clearly: We do not have to live this way.”\n\nThe White House’s invitation to activists to help coordinate its effort shows that it recognizes that the movement has grown considerably in the last 10 years, becoming more powerful and effective. “The biggest fundamental change is that survivors took over,” Jackson, who is joining the office as deputy director, told Vox earlier this year. “Survivors went from being voices that contribute to some broader campaign to being the leaders of everything. When survivors started to take over ... we saw a huge shift away from simple hardware regulation [of firearms] to an array of solutions that are chipping away at the problem, and a more comprehensive approach.”\n\nThe creation of the office also reflects that gun-safety proponents represent a real constituency in American politics: According to a Pew Research Center report from earlier this year, six in 10 Americans say gun violence is a serious problem, 61 percent say it’s too easy to legally obtain a gun, and 58 percent support stricter gun laws. Rep. Maxwell Frost (D), the first Gen-Z member of Congress, has made ending gun violence one of his top legislative priorities. He introduced Biden at the event and noted that “this issue, especially for young people, especially for marginalized communities, is a matter of survival.”\n\nFor the millions of Americans who want to see an end to the horrific toll that gun violence takes every year, there’s an understandable sense of despair that sets in after news of gun violence — and a healthy amount of skepticism when politicians offer solutions that seem to fall short. In opening the office, though, the White House seems to be acknowledging that it can’t afford to wait for Republicans to get on board. Directing his final comments at the survivors and activists, Biden explicitly aligned himself and his administration with their cause. “You’re right. We’re by your side, and we’re never going to give up dealing with this problem,” he said. “We can do this, we just have to keep going. We just have to keep the faith.”'}}",88.75,2

In the Asia ...', 'Full_text': 'For over 20 years, Pew Research Center has tracked international public opinion of world leaders, including the U.S. president. In his second year in office, Joe Biden receives generally positive ratings in the countries surveyed by the Center. In most of these places, Biden’s ratings are higher than those of his predecessor in the White House, Donald Trump, but lower than his own ratings in 2021.\n\nHere are six charts on what people in surveyed countries think of Biden, based on polls conducted in each nation in the spring of 2022.\n\nA median of 58% of adults across 18 countries say they have confidence in Joe Biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs.\n\nConfidence in Biden varies widely by region and country. In Europe alone, the share of adults who offer a positive rating of Biden ranges from 82% in Poland to just under a third (31%) in Hungary. In the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea and Japan stand out with 70% and 62% of adults, respectively, saying they have confidence in the U.S. president. Opinion is more divided in Malaysia, Australia and Singapore.\n\nIn Israel, six-in-ten adults say they have confidence in Biden, though fewer than half attach positive descriptors to him like “strong leader” (41% say this about him), “caring about ordinary people” (36%) and “charismatic” (27%).\n\nConfidence in Biden has dropped significantly in most places surveyed in 2021 and 2022. The share of adults who have confidence in Biden on the world stage has decreased by double digits in 13 of the 14 countries surveyed in both years. In Italy, Greece, Spain and Singapore, half or more now have little or no confidence in the U.S. president. Still, in most places – including key European countries – confidence in Biden remains higher than confidence in Trump. Israel is the one exception: While 60% of Israelis have confidence in Biden, 71% said the same about Trump in 2019.\n\nOlder adults generally have more confidence in Biden than younger adults. In most countries surveyed, adults ages 50 and older are more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to have confidence in Biden. For example, nearly three-quarters of Belgians ages 50 and older give Biden positive ratings on the world stage, compared with roughly half of Belgians ages 18 to 29. Double-digit differences also exist in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, South Korea, Sweden, Japan and France.\n\nIn Hungary, Italy and Poland, the opposite pattern appears: Younger adults are more likely than older adults to have confidence in Biden.\n\nThere is more public approval than disapproval of Biden’s choice to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan – but low ratings of the withdrawal itself. A median of 52% of adults across 18 countries surveyed say it was the right decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while 39% say it was the wrong decision. Responses vary by region, and in Poland, Israel, Japan and Hungary, roughly two-in-ten do not offer a response.\n\nAcross all 18 countries, a median of just a third of adults (33%) say the withdrawal was handled well. Far more (median of 56%) say it was not handled well.\n\nAmericans’ views of the decision to withdraw troops, as well as the execution of the plan, are largely aligned with views from around the world. Six-in-ten Americans say it was the right decision, while 38% hold the opposite view. And roughly a third (32%) say the withdrawal was handled well, whereas two-thirds (66%) say it was not.\n\nIn places where the U.S. is seen more favorably, so is Biden. For example, the two countries surveyed where people have the most favorable views of the United States – Poland and South Korea – are also among the countries where people have the most confidence in Biden.\n\nIn nearly all countries surveyed, more people express a favorable view of the U.S. than confidence in Biden – though the opposite is true in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and Malaysia. In Germany and Australia, the share of adults with a positive view of the U.S. and confidence in Biden are roughly the same. This pattern holds at the individual level as well: Favorable views of the U.S. correlate with positive ratings of Biden.\n\nConfidence in Biden is similar to confidence in other Western leaders. A median of 58% of adults across the 18 surveyed countries have confidence in Biden’s handling of global affairs, just a few points lower than the median share who say the same about French President Emmanuel Macron (61%) and equal to positive ratings of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (58%). Larger shares, however, say they are not confident in Biden than say the same of his German counterpart.\n\nWithin specific countries, there are greater differences in ratings of the three leaders. In Poland and Israel, for instance, larger shares are more confident in Biden than either of his European counterparts, while in Greece, it is Macron who receives the highest ratings.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2023/06/27/international-views-of-biden-and-u-s-largely-positive/', 'Headline': 'International Views of Biden and U.S. Largely Positive', 'Snippet': 'Overwhelmingly, people believe the U.S. interferes in the affairs of other countries (82%), but most also believe the U.S. contributes to peace and stability around the world (61%).

Across 23 countries in a new Pew Research Center survey, a median of 54% express confidence in Biden, while 39% say they lack confidence in him.\n\nSimilarly, overall views of the United States are largely positive: A median of 59% give the U.S. a favorable rating, including around seven-in-ten or more in Poland, Israel, South Korea, Nigeria, Japan and Kenya. Hungary is the only country surveyed where fewer than half see the U.S. favorably.\n\nAmerica’s actions on the world stage have often shaped its global image, and as the survey highlights, public opinion about U.S. foreign policy is often complex, with people seeing both positive and negative sides to American power. Overwhelmingly, people believe the U.S. interferes in the affairs of other countries – a median of 82% say it does this a great deal or fair amount – but most also believe the U.S. contributes to peace and stability around the world.\n\nInternational public opinion is essentially divided over how much the U.S. considers the interests of other countries when it is making foreign policy decisions. However, in roughly half of the nations surveyed, the share of the public that thinks the U.S. does consider other countries is higher than it has ever been since Pew Research Center started asking this question more than two decades ago.\n\nThe survey also explores other aspects of American power, including elements of U.S. soft power. America’s technology, universities, military and entertainment are all seen as being the best or above average when compared with other wealthy nations, although the U.S. receives mixed reviews for its standard of living.\n\nPerceptions of American economic power have increased in several countries over the past few years, and respondents tend to name the U.S., rather than China, as the world’s leading economic power. However, in a number of European countries, as well as Australia, China is considered the top global economy.\n\nThese findings come from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted from Feb. 20 to May 22, 2023, among 27,285 people in 23 countries, many of which are key U.S. allies. Below are some of the other findings regarding America’s overall image, ratings of Biden, views of U.S. foreign policy, American soft power and American economic power.\n\nOverall ratings for the U.S.\n\nAmong the countries surveyed, Poland, where positive views of the U.S. have increased substantially since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, gives the U.S. its highest rating: 93% of Poles express a favorable opinion. The U.S. gets its lowest marks in another central European country: Hungary, where just 44% of adults offer a positive view, down from 55% in 2022.\n\nElsewhere, views of the U.S. have mostly remained stable since last year, although favorable ratings have declined somewhat in Sweden, South Korea, Canada and Germany.\n\nThe current study includes eight middle-income nations that Pew Research Center has not surveyed since 2019, before the outbreak of COVID-19, due to the challenges of conducting face-to-face interviews during the pandemic. In all eight countries, there has been a significant increase in U.S. favorability since 2019. This is similar to the pattern found in Pew Research Center surveys over the past several years, which documented a decline in America’s global image during Donald Trump’s presidency and a rebound in ratings for the U.S. following the election of Joe Biden.\n\nAttitudes toward Biden\n\nAs with ratings for the U.S. overall, Biden gets his highest marks in Poland, where 83% voice confidence in his leadership of world affairs. Roughly seven-in-ten or more also express confidence in Biden in Sweden, Kenya, Nigeria, Israel, the Netherlands and Germany. Majorities in about half of the countries polled give Biden positive ratings, although opinion of Biden is, on balance, more negative than positive in NATO allies Italy, Greece, France and Spain. And he gets his lowest ratings in Hungary.\n\nIn middle-income nations in Latin America, Africa and Asia, Biden receives significantly higher marks than his predecessor. For instance, 44% of Brazilians have confidence in Biden, compared with 28% for Trump in 2019. And in some countries where Trump was relatively popular, ratings for Biden are higher. For example, 71% of Nigerians say they have confidence in Biden, up from 58% for Trump four years ago. And 64% of Indians give Biden positive marks, compared with the 56% voicing confidence for Trump in 2019.\n\nAmerica’s role on the world stage\n\nSince 2002, we have periodically included a question asking respondents whether they believe the U.S. takes into account the interests of countries like theirs when making foreign policy decisions. And typically we’ve found that people do not think the U.S. considers their interests.\n\nViews are divided in the current survey, with a median of 49% across 23 countries saying the U.S. takes into account their interests a great deal or fair amount, and 50% saying it considers their interests not very much or not at all.\n\nHowever, in many nations, the share of the public that thinks the U.S. listens to countries like theirs has been on the rise, and in 12 countries, it is at the highest point we’ve seen in any of our surveys. For instance, in Poland, Germany and the United Kingdom – three key NATO allies of the U.S. – the share saying the U.S. considers their interests is larger now than at any point over the past two decades.\n\nIn addition to the question on whether the U.S. considers other countries’ interests, the survey included two other questions about America’s role in global politics. First, we asked about how much the U.S. interferes in the affairs of other countries. Second, we asked about how much the U.S. contributes to peace and stability around the world.\n\nLooking at the two questions together highlights the complex views people often hold about the U.S. and the ways in which people see both positive and negative aspects to the role America plays on the world stage.\n\nA median of 50% across the 23 nations surveyed say both that the U.S. interferes a great deal or fair amount in the affairs of other countries and that it contributes a great deal or fair amount to peace and stability around the world.\n\nAbout one-in-three believe the U.S. interferes but does not contribute to global peace and stability. Half or more have this position in Greece, Hungary and Italy.\n\nRelatively few believe the U.S. does not meddle in the politics of other nations.\n\nAmerican soft power\n\nThe survey included a number of questions on social, political and economic aspects of America’s image – things that are often considered a part of U.S. “soft power.”\n\nFor instance, when asked how politically stable, dangerous, democratic, religious and tolerant the U.S. is, respondents generally say it is about the same as other affluent nations. But a sizable number believe the U.S. is more politically stable, including half or more in Poland, Nigeria and Israel. Still, four-in-ten or more see the U.S. as less stable in Australia, Sweden and the Netherlands.\n\nWhile on the negative side, many think it is a less tolerant and more dangerous place to live compared with other wealthy countries. Nearly two-thirds of Australians believe the U.S. is a more dangerous place to live, and at least half hold this view in the UK, Spain and Germany.\n\nRespondents generally think America’s technology, entertainment, universities and military are the best or above average when compared with other affluent nations.\n\nThe U.S. receives lower marks for its standard of living, although 51% say it is the best or better than average.\n\nAs a separate analysis shows, only 44% of Americans think the United States’ standard of living is the best or above average. Americans are also less likely than others around the world to praise their technological achievements and universities.\n\nYounger adults are especially likely to embrace U.S. popular culture. In 18 nations, adults ages 18 to 39 are more likely than older adults to say American movies, music and television are the best or above average.\n\nFor instance, 84% of Greeks under 40 say American entertainment is the best or better than average, compared with 62% of those ages 40 and older.\n\nWhile young people are more positive than older adults about American entertainment, they express greater concerns about safety in the U.S.\n\nIn 12 nations, those under 40 are particularly likely to say the U.S. is a more dangerous place to live than other wealthy nations. In the Netherlands, for example, 61% of 18- to 39-year-olds say the U.S. is more dangerous, while just 34% of those 40 and older agree.\n\nU.S. economic power\n\nThe global economy has experienced a number of severe shocks in recent years, with many nations suffering recessions after the outbreak of COVID-19, followed by high inflation as the world emerged from the pandemic. There has also been a shift over the past few years in perceptions of global economic power. In several countries, people have become more likely to name the U.S., rather than China, as the world’s top economy.\n\nOverall, a median of 41% across the 23 nations polled believe the U.S. is the world’s leading economic power, while 33% name China. The share who say the U.S. is the world’s leading economic power has increased significantly since 2020 in Germany, Sweden, Japan, France, Canada and the Netherlands.\n\nIt has also increased in Indonesia, Hungary, Poland and Nigeria since 2019, the last time the question was asked in those countries.\n\nThe survey also includes a question in middle-income nations about American investment in their countries. Across eight nations, a median of 68% say U.S. investment has benefited their countries’ economies a great deal or a fair amount. Assessments are especially positive in Nigeria, Kenya, India and Mexico, where seven-in-ten or more hold this view. Argentina is the only nation polled where a majority believe U.S. investment has been bad for their country.\n\nSpotlight: America’s image improves in Mexico\n\nSince we last surveyed Mexico in 2019, there has been a sharp turnaround in Mexican attitudes toward the U.S. During Trump’s presidency, ratings for the U.S. declined significantly in many nations across the globe, including Mexico, where Trump and his policies – especially his proposal to build a wall on the border with Mexico – were extremely unpopular. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the share of the Mexican public that expressed confidence in Trump was in the single digits and the lowest rating for Trump each year in our annual cross-national survey was in Mexico.\n\nToday, Biden’s ratings in Mexico are not especially high – 43% have confidence in him – but they are considerably higher than Trump’s were, and they are in line with the assessments Barack Obama received when he was in the White House. Similarly, overall ratings for the U.S. have rebounded to roughly where they were during Obama’s second term.\n\nSpotlight: Differing views of the U.S. in central Europe\n\nIn recent years, Poland and Hungary have featured prominently in discussions about the rise of populism in Europe. Both countries have governments controlled by right-wing populist parties – Law and Justice (PiS) in Poland and Fidesz in Hungary – both have had tensions with the European Union over domestic policies and both have experienced a deterioration in the quality of their democracy according to research organizations such as International IDEA, the Economist Intelligence Unit and Freedom House.\n\nHowever, the two countries look very different when it comes to public opinion about international affairs, including views about the U.S. Poles have generally had relatively favorable attitudes about the U.S. in our surveys over the past two decades, but since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Polish attitudes have become even more positive. And in the current survey, Poles are consistently at or near the top of the list, in terms of expressing positive views about the U.S.\n\nHungarians, in contrast, are consistently at the bottom. They give Biden his lowest rating, and Hungary is the only country where fewer than half have a favorable opinion of the U.S. They are the least likely to think the U.S. considers their interests when making foreign policy and the most likely to believe the U.S. does not contribute to peace and stability around the world. Often, these negative views are especially common among supporters of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party.\n\nRoad map to the report\n\nThe chapters that follow discuss these findings and others in more detail:\n\nChapter 1 looks at overall opinion of the U.S. across the countries surveyed, including how perceptions have shifted over the years\n\nChapter 2 examines confidence in U.S. President Joe Biden to do the right thing in world affairs and how ratings of Biden compare with those of former presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama\n\nChapter 3 considers the negative and positive roles the U.S. plays in international affairs'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/22/opinions/biden-israel-gaza-ukraine-china-mccallion/index.html', 'Headline': 'Opinion: Biden is making more foreign policy messes than he’s fixing', 'Snippet': 'Biden further asserted that “making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America’s national security.” In a Washington Post op-ed this weekend, he reiterated that the US is “the ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: Christopher McCallion is a fellow at Defense Priorities, a foreign policy think tank based in Washington, DC. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nAmerica currently finds itself embroiled in three major geopolitical crises, in three distant parts of the world, pitting it against three consequential powers, on behalf of three countries that are not treaty allies of the United States.\n\nNotwithstanding the temporary truce and hostage deal announced Tuesday, US forces are still on hand in the Middle East to deter Iran and Hezbollah from intervening against Israel in its war with Hamas, putting American troops at risk and threatening to pull the US into another major war in the region. American troops have already been targeted by dozens of drone and missile attacks from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and have conducted retaliatory strikes in response. In Eastern Europe, the US is essentially engaged in a proxy war with Russia over the latter’s invasion of Ukraine. In East Asia, the US risks a catastrophic showdown with China over the political status of Taiwan.\n\nDuring his Oval Office address last month, President Joe Biden argued that all these flashpoints are interconnected fronts in what the administration has previously framed as a global struggle between democracy and autocracy. Biden referenced former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s quote that America is “the indispensable nation,” adding that “American leadership is what holds the world together.” Biden further asserted that “making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America’s national security.” In a Washington Post op-ed this weekend, he reiterated that the US is “the essential nation.”\n\nThese claims do not stand up to scrutiny. America’s entanglement in these crises is only further overstretching its capabilities, courting unnecessary risks, inflaming local enmities and depriving the American people of resources better used at home. Indeed, the American people are increasingly reluctant to foot the bill indefinitely for military aid to conflicts abroad, with recent polls showing declining support among both Democrats and Republicans for both Israel and Ukraine.\n\nThe decades-long US policy of maintaining permanent friends and enemies in the Middle East has been counterproductive to its stated interest in regional stability. The US in recent years antagonized Iran by imposing a “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions while assassinating key Iranian military figure, Qasem Soleimani. Meanwhile, the US has inadvertently boosted Tehran’s regional influence by overthrowing Saddam Hussein’s government in Iraq and later by contributing arms to anti-Assad forces during the Syrian Civil War, which ultimately empowered Iran-backed militias in the fight against both ISIS and US-supported Sunni rebels.\n\nNor has regional stability been advanced by the United States’ partners, whose bad behavior has been enabled by unconditioned support from Washington. The US has consistently backed Israel despite its continued settlement-building in the occupied West Bank and long-standing blockade of Gaza, feeding the underlying Israeli-Palestinian conflict that now threatens to engulf the region.\n\nAnd despite its “democracy versus autocracy” rhetoric, the US supported Saudi Arabia’s gruesome war against Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, which produced what the United Nations called “the worst humanitarian crisis in the world,” with some 377,000 people killed and approximately 80% of the country in need of humanitarian aid. The Biden administration has since doubled down on its security relationship with the Saudis.\n\nContrary to the goal of avoiding a broader conflict in the Middle East or Ukraine, the president’s Oval Office address last month instead sought to frame these crises in global terms. Biden claimed that if the US does not thwart distant adversaries, they and others will be emboldened to pursue further aggression, and American alliances will be undermined. This reasoning is based on dubious assumptions drawn from WWII and the Cold War, respectively known as the “Munich analogy” and the “domino theory.”\n\nBiden claimed that if Russia is not stopped in Ukraine, Putin will march on to Poland or the Baltic states. This is not plausible. Russia does not have the material capability to try to conquer Eastern Europe, even if it wanted to. Even without the US and Canada, European NATO members in 2022 spent vastly more on defense and retained many more active duty personnel than Russia, had a combined GDP nearly nine times larger, a population 3.5 times larger and their own nuclear deterrent. Russia’s poor performance in Ukraine makes this fear even more remote.\n\nThe president also made a veiled suggestion that if Russia is not decisively defeated in Ukraine, China would be emboldened to invade Taiwan. This assumption is similarly unfounded. As political scientists like Daryl Press and Jonathan Mercer have argued, states tend to predict an adversary’s future behavior based on current capabilities and perceived interests rather than past behavior in a separate context. If China invaded Taiwan, it would most likely be because Beijing has a greater stake in Taiwan than Washington does, possesses a military advantage a hundred miles off its coast and believes it has no path to peaceful reunification — not because the US wavered in its support for Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no sign America’s treaty allies are losing faith in the credibility of its commitment to their defense. Low defense spending on the part of capable states like Japan and Germany indicates America’s allies remain all too confident they can continue passing the buck to Uncle Sam. Were the US to do less for their defense, Japan and Germany would almost certainly do more out of their imperative for self-preservation — not simply surrender their sovereignty to China or Russia.\n\nThe US should adopt a more restrained grand strategy, one that would more rigorously set priorities among foreign interests, entail fewer risks of entanglement, be less prone to provoke distant rivals and be more aligned with America’s domestic resources and needs.\n\nFirst, the US should not maintain eternal allies and enemies. As former President Richard Nixon once said, “Our interests must shape our commitments, rather than the other way around.” Military alliances are commitments to wage war on another’s behalf if necessary. America should therefore enter alliances to counterbalance specific threats when they emerge; as threats change, so should alliances. Alliances involve significant costs and risks and must therefore be guided by truly vital security interests, not pretensions of global leadership.\n\nSecond, the US should stop uniting its adversaries. By framing international politics as a fight between democracy and autocracy, the US is merely ensuring that it has lots of enemies arrayed against it. The growing security alignment between China, Russia and Iran is largely based on a common threat from the United States, rather than an attempt to export a given regime type (which they don’t share). The US itself has by far the most extensive record of trying to impose its own values on others by force. Prudent rapprochements with former adversaries should be made when there are no vital interests in dispute.\n\nThird, the United States should shift the burden of managing regional threats over to its regional partners, especially in the Middle East and Europe. Ammunition shortages resulting from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza are only one demonstration that America’s resources are finite.\n\nScaling back America’s overextended military presence would incentivize capable regional states with an interest in self-preservation to pool forces to counterbalance local threats. Burden-shifting to regional partners would also mitigate the risk of the US getting pulled into a major war and reduce the substantial costs of maintaining forces overseas. The United States’ favorable power position and distance from Eurasia allows it to pass the buck to others while remaining secure.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2023-06-27/survey-finds-positive-international-opinion-of-the-u-s-biden', 'Headline': 'Survey Finds Positive International Opinion of the U.S., Biden', 'Snippet': 'Majorities in all but one country included in a recent survey have a favorable opinion of the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. ...

A smaller share – 54% – approve of Biden, while about 4 in 10 respondents lack confidence in him. Some Western European countries such as France, Greece, Italy and Spain were less likely to have confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing in world affairs.\n\nWhile Biden’s favorability was lower overall than that of the country he leads, his rating is far better than his predecessor’s for the most part, as measured by Pew. Biden’s international approval rating has been better than former President Donald Trump’s throughout his time in office, especially in middle-income nations in Latin America, Africa and Asia. In Mexico, for example, Trump had just an 8% favorability rating in 2019 compared to 43% for Biden in Pew’s most recent survey.\n\nThese numbers likely have political roots. Across the 17 countries where people were asked to place themselves on an ideological scale ranging from left to right, respondents on the political right generally had more positive views of the U.S. than those on left.\n\nThe Best Political Cartoons on Joe Biden\n\nWhen it comes to views of the U.S. as a whole, the countries with the most positive ratings were Poland (93%), Israel (87%), South Korea (79%), Nigeria (74%), Japan (73%) and Kenya (71%). Hungary – which has remained a strong ally of Russia since its invasion of U.S.-supported Ukraine in February 2022 – was the only country that had under 50% of respondents with favorable views. Ratings also dropped marginally from 2022 to 2023 in Germany, Canada, South Korea and Sweden.\n\nThose surveyed otherwise have a somewhat complicated view of the U.S.’s place in the world order. A median of 82% said the country interferes a great deal or a fair amount in the affairs of other nations – and that number rose above 90% in Greece and Italy. But even with this in mind, respondents were split on whether the U.S. takes their country’s interest in mind when dealing with international policy decisions. The U.S. also had the highest percentage of people who view it as the world’s leading economic power (41%), while China came in just behind at 33%.\n\nAdditionally, 61% of those surveyed said the U.S. contributes to peace and stability around the world, with that number reaching 85% in Poland – a Ukraine ally. Some countries, however, also view the U.S. as being a more dangerous place than other similarly wealthy nations. Less than a third (28%) thought so overall, but respondents in several countries such as Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom said the U.S. is more dangerous, comparatively. Young people ages 18-39 were more likely to have this sentiment across the countries surveyed.\n\nREAD:\n\nU.S. Lags Behind Other Wealthy Countries in Health Outcomes, Study Finds\n\nThe 23 countries surveyed by Pew were: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the U.K. Eight countries were included in the report for the first time since 2019, due to issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/06/22/international-public-opinion-of-the-u-s-remains-positive/', 'Headline': '1.

In Poland, ratings of the U.S. are now at a record high.\n\nNearly nine-in-ten also have a positive view of the U.S. in South Korea, a 12 percentage point increase since 2021, and the largest uptick in positive ratings since the previous year.

Still, a median of just 19% say the U.S. is a very reliable partner. The share of the public who consider the U.S. a very reliable partner is largest in Israel, where 31% hold this view.\n\nThe share who says the U.S. is very or somewhat reliable has increased since 2021 in several nations. In South Korea, 83% express this opinion, up 25 points since 2021. Significant increases can also be seen in Sweden (+21 points), Australia (+16 points), Canada (+16 points), Germany (+11 points), Belgium (+10 points), the UK (+10 points), the Netherlands (+9 points) and Spain (+7 points).\n\nIn every country, to the extent that people see the U.S. as reliable, they are much more likely to rate the U.S. positively overall. In the Netherlands, for example, among people who say the U.S. is a reliable partner to their country, 65% have a favorable view of the U.S. Among those who say the U.S. is not reliable, only 17% view the U.S. positively.\n\nMajorities say partisan divisions are deep in U.S.\n\nPeople in the countries surveyed tend to rate the U.S. political system poorly, despite generally positive views of the country overall. For example, in our 2021 survey conducted shortly after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, people were split over whether the U.S. political system works well or not. Most of those surveyed did not believe that democracy in the U.S. was a good example for other countries to follow. And in a 2017 survey, many people in Canada and Europe said they dislike American ideas about democracy.\n\nIn the current survey, a median of 74% across 17 countries say there are strong or very strong conflicts between people who support different political parties in the U.S. In seven nations, four-in-ten or more see very strong partisan conflicts in the U.S. Almost half in Australia and 61% in Canada see intense partisan divisions.\n\nFew people see only weak conflicts or no conflicts at all when it comes to party differences in the U.S., but it is notable that the share of people who did not respond to this question is relatively high in some countries, including as many as 18% in Poland.\n\nAmericans agree with others around the world that there are strong partisan conflicts in their country. In a 2021 survey, the U.S., along with South Korea, had the largest share of the public saying there were strong conflicts between people who support different political parties in their own society.\n\nPeople who say there are very strong partisan conflicts in the U.S. are less likely than those who say there are not very strong conflicts to see the U.S. favorably in 12 countries. This difference is largest in Sweden: Among those who say there are not very strong conflicts (including strong, not strong and no conflicts at all), 75% have a favorable view of the U.S. Among those who say there are very strong partisan conflicts in the U.S., only 53% have a positive opinion of the country. Smaller differences in the same direction can be seen in Australia, the Netherlands, Canada, Malaysia, Italy, South Korea, Greece, Spain, Germany, France and Singapore.\n\nMany favorable on U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, yet say the withdrawal was poorly handled\n\nThe U.S. decision to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 is generally seen as having been the right decision. A median of 51% across 17 countries say this action was the right choice, compared with a median of 39% who say it was the wrong choice. In a few places, though, roughly one-in-five do not offer an opinion.\n\nHalf of Canadians feel the American decision to withdraw troops was the right one, while 40% say it was the wrong one.\n\nIn Europe, views of the withdrawal are more positive than negative. Half or more in six of the 10 nations surveyed feel favorably toward the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Views are split in Italy, while half or more are negative on the withdrawal in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK.\n\nHalf of Israelis say the U.S. troop withdrawal was the right decision, while 30% say it was the wrong decision and 20% do not offer an opinion.\n\nAcross the Asia-Pacific publics surveyed, views of the U.S. exit of Afghanistan are slightly more positive overall than in Europe. Majorities in Malaysia, Australia and Singapore look favorably on the decision. While 47% say the withdrawal was a good choice in Japan, 19% do not offer a view either way. And opinion is split in South Korea: 45% say the withdrawal was the right choice and 50% say it was the wrong choice.\n\nAmericans generally approve of the decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan: 60% say this was the right decision. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (78%) are much more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners (39%) to hold this view.\n\nDespite generally supportive views of the U.S. withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, public opinion in the countries surveyed is less positive on how the withdrawal was handled. A median of 57% across the 17 countries polled say the withdrawal was not handled well, compared with a median of 33% who say it was handled well. Only in two countries do half or more feel favorably toward the handling of the U.S. exit from Afghanistan: Poland and Malaysia.\n\nIn Canada and Europe, views of how the American withdrawal was handled are more negative than positive. About six-in-ten Canadians and majorities in seven of the 10 European countries polled feel negatively toward the handling of the withdrawal, including two-thirds or more in Germany (67%) and the UK (77%).\n\nIsraelis view the U.S. handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan more unfavorably than favorably: 51% say it was not handled well, compared with 31% who say it was handled well (19% did not offer an opinion).\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, negative views of how the U.S. dealt with its troop withdrawal range from 46% in Malaysia to 73% in Australia.\n\nAgain, American views look similar to those in other parts of the world. Only around a third of Americans say the withdrawal from Afghanistan was handled well, though this share is higher among Democrats (46%) than Republicans (15%).\n\nThose with more education (postsecondary degree or above) are more likely to say the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was not handled well, compared with those with less education (secondary or below) in most countries surveyed. In Belgium, for example, those with more education are 20 percentage points more likely to have a negative view than those with less education.\n\nLess confidence in Biden in his second year as president\n\nAlong with a positive opinion of the U.S., most in the nations surveyed also have trust in the U.S. president. A median of 60% across 17 countries have confidence in Biden to do the right thing in world affairs.\n\nPoles stand out for their particularly high trust in Biden (82%). Not only is it higher than any other country in the current survey, but it is also a record high for trust in the U.S. president in Poland. The last time this question was asked in 2019, 51% of Poles had confidence in Trump’s handling of international affairs. The previous high was in 2015, when 64% expressed confidence in Obama.\n\nPeople in Sweden, South Korea, the Netherlands and Germany also have relatively high levels of confidence in Biden to do the right thing on the international stage. But not all countries have positive ratings of the U.S. president: Half or more lack confidence in Biden in Spain, Singapore, Italy and Greece.\n\nWhile still relatively high in most places, trust in the U.S. president has dropped sharply since 2021 in nearly every country surveyed. Some initial excitement about a new president may wane after their first year, but the decrease in trust since 2021 is much larger than any small dips Obama saw in 2010 or 2011 in the same countries.\n\nDespite double-digit decreases in most countries, confidence in the U.S. president is nowhere near the lowest it has been in the past. (The exception is Singapore, which was surveyed for the first time last year.) Ratings for Biden are still higher than those for Trump or Bush in every country except Israel.\n\nIsraeli views about U.S. presidents have often differed from attitudes in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. In most other countries polled, confidence in the U.S. president was highest while Obama was in office and lowest during Trump’s administration. In Israel, Obama received both the highest (2014) and lowest (2011 and 2015) ratings. Confidence in Trump was similar, if somewhat higher, than trust in Obama.\n\nChanges in confidence over time are related to perceptions of America’s reliability as a partner. While most groups have shown a decrease in trust in Biden since 2021, the change is largest among people who think the U.S. is not a reliable partner to their country. Across the 14 countries surveyed in both 2021 and 2022, confidence in Biden has plummeted among those who think the U.S. is not reliable, from a median of 58% in 2021 to just 24% now. But among those who say the U.S. is reliable, the drop in confidence in the U.S. president is much smaller, from a median of 84% in 2021 to 68% in the current survey.\n\nIn every country except Germany, confidence in Biden to do the right thing in world affairs is much lower among people who think America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was handled poorly. For example, among Canadians who think the withdrawal was handled well, 75% trust Biden when it comes to international affairs. Among Canadians who think the withdrawal was not handled well, only 54% trust Biden.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/29/opinions/biden-democracy-israel-ukraine-taiwan-andelman/index.html', 'Headline': 'Opinion: Joe Biden is not getting the credit he deserves on foreign ...', 'Snippet': 'Opinion: Biden is making more foreign policy messes than he’s fixing In contrast to George W.

He formerly was a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\nCritics claim that President Joe Biden has failed in his efforts to project American power effectively for the American people and their allies around the world. But I am confident he will go down in history, as he should, for being one of the rare presidents who has accomplished something quite extraordinary: He has carefully defined and quite successfully defended democracy and democratic values before a host of existential challenges.\n\nFormer Presidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush wound up ping-ponging from crisis to crisis with no clear sense of what shape the horizon might take, frequently updating their worldviews to match the moment. Bush was against nation-building until he was for it in Afghanistan and Iraq; Obama was against foreign intervention until he was for it in Libya; Trump was for sweet-talking global adversaries until he was against it.\n\nBiden, in contrast, has been operating on the basis of a real weltanschauung (or worldview). Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told me and other students in his class at Harvard that few leaders, especially presidents of the United States, operated on the world stage with a clear-eyed sense of where they want the world to be at the end of their four or eight years and then worked to get there.\n\nAnd indeed, few have defined and embraced democracy as a doctrine, viewed crises and partners through such a prism and worked so effectively to further these essential values more than Biden, who spent decades on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and eight years as vice president before becoming the leader of the Free World.\n\nBiden’s latest challenge, of course, is in Israel and Gaza. In the face of a barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel and the unrelenting response of the government under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden has stood squarely by Israel, defined by The Economist’s Democracy Index as the only democracy in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nIn contrast to George W. Bush, Biden has modeled how diplomacy as well as force can support efforts to shore up democracy. The US reportedly played a crucial role in getting many Israeli hostages released from Hamas. But the US also quickly dispatched two aircraft carrier strike groups and 900 additional troops to the Middle East to back up his warning to Iran and Hezbollah not to broaden the conflict.\n\nThose moves not only safeguard Israel but help secure American interests in the region and show that a democratic power can constrain fundamentalist ones.\n\nBiden is similar to other presidents in getting little credit for what doesn’t happen. Beyond containing the Israel-Hamas conflict (so far), he also hasn’t been properly recognized for avoiding a direct US-Russia confrontation — and likely conflagration — by tempering the delivery of advanced weapons to Ukraine and restraining its efforts to join NATO, even as the US has slowly but steadily ratcheted up the levels of military support for Ukraine.\n\nUkraine, of course, is trying desperately to retain its democratic orientation in the face of Moscow’s violent and autocratic challenge. Though now facing obstacles in Congress, there’s no question that the Biden administration’s support has been essential to Ukraine’s impressive — and, to many, unexpected —success in its continued fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression.\n\nThen there’s Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping has redoubled efforts to build pressure to force the island nation’s absorption into mainland China, sending warships and warplanes ever closer to Taiwan — even into and through its airspace. But a still-independent government in Taipei is planning a democratic presidential election on January 13, a robust three-way race in which voters consider an outcome that could well define the island’s future.\n\nThis is happening with determined American political, diplomatic and military support, including Biden being clearer than previous presidents that the US will defend Taiwan. Despite GOP foot-dragging in Congress, Biden has included funding for Taiwan as well as Ukraine and Israel in a new aid package — an all-but-unprecedented effort at American assistance for democracies under threat.\n\nBut while he’s minced no words in continuing to call Xi “a dictator,” Biden has managed the relationship with Beijing rather than rupturing it in ways that could be dangerous. Just this fall, he succeeded in reopening military-to-military channels of communication with China for the first time since Beijing severed them after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022.\n\nThose who see Biden’s abrupt and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan as a failure that damages his record on democracy have themselves failed to recognize a reality that Biden had earlier come to appreciate.\n\nIn Afghanistan, democracy never really took root at all. Its ill-conceived and improbable “elections” were little more than window dressing on a deeply flawed and corrupt kleptocracy that America had been backing with the bodies of thousands of its troops.\n\nAs Sarah Chayes, once a special assistant in the Pentagon, wrote in Foreign Affairs, “Joe Biden was outspoken about his opposition to the intervention.” That underscores the point that Biden’s success isn’t just his principled view of democracies (George W. Bush also prominently called for democratization) but shrewdness in knowing when and where to promote them most effectively.\n\nOne could ask what happens when Biden finds himself facing a leader with anti-democratic tendencies like India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who presides over what close observers have called “an electoral autocracy” in what was long a model democratic nation. There, it would appear, Biden has shown steadiness in waiting for the forces that propelled other truly democratic leaders of India’s past to harness the will of the people to return them to power. It has been and will require a most delicate balance that I am persuaded Biden has been adept in implementing.\n\nBiden’s determination to defend democracy wherever it manages to gain a foothold and help it to survive, then prosper, is something that makes him tick and remain appealing to others, as I’ve seen in so many parts of the world. Political leaders and other officials from Paris to Riga that I’ve come in contact with during the Biden years have suggested repeatedly how imperative it is that America retain the values Biden holds so close.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/5/30/bidens-five-mistakes-in', 'Headline': 'Biden’s five mistakes in Ukraine | Opinions - Al Jazeera', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden, walks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ahead of a working session on Ukraine during the G7 Summit in Hiroshima on May 21, 2023 [Reuters/Susan Walsh]', 'Full_text': 'Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, much has been said about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s miscalculations. Last October, I wrote about Putin’s vanity and megalomania which led him to overestimate Russian military capabilities, underestimate Ukrainian capacity for resistance, and miscalculate NATO’s unity and America’s strategic resolve.\n\nBut the Russian president is not the only one making bad judgements with devastating consequences in Ukraine and beyond.\n\nAs the war drags on with no end in sight, it is important to address US President Joe Biden’s – and his Western allies’ – miscalculations in Ukraine as well. These, unsurprisingly, mirror Russia’s own failures, as both leaders prove incapable of learning the lessons of imperial hubris.\n\nFrom the start, Biden took the moral high ground, framing the conflict in Ukraine as a global one between democracy and autocracy, between respect for international law and national sovereignty and the scourge of Russian aggression. Yet, he pleaded with world autocrats to join the crusade and disregarded America’s own illegal wars.\n\nHe underestimated the power of Russian nationalism and rejected Moscow’s fears of NATO expansion towards its borders as baseless excuses for Russian imperialism.\n\nIn the months leading up to the war, Biden undermined efforts to implement the Minsk agreements signed in 2014 and 2015 to end the conflict in the Donbas region. They were meant to pave the way for the creation of two autonomous Russian areas in eastern Ukraine and stave off the expansion of Russian intervention in the country.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia had signed on, but France and Germany, which helped conclude and refine these agreements, failed to push hard enough for their implementation. Despite having much to lose from a devastating European war, European powers did little to stop the escalation.\n\nBiden also underestimated Russia’s military endurance, betting on Ukrainians defeating it just as the Afghans defeated the Soviet Union with help from the United States.\n\nBut for Moscow, Ukraine is far more important and strategic than Afghanistan, considering its shared history and geographic proximity. From Putin’s perspective, Ukraine is vital for Russia’s national security and his regime’s survival. Clearly, he would rather have it destroyed than see it join a Western alliance.\n\nDuring the first year of the war, Russian setbacks from Kyiv to Kharkiv demonstrated Ukraine’s resolve and resilience. But the tide of war began to change this year. As the fall of Bakhmut after months of vicious fighting has shown, Russia is no less resilient or determined to win. That is a recipe for a devastating stalemate.\n\nBiden has also overestimated Ukraine’s capacity for war. This is not to be confused with courage and steadfastness, of which the Ukrainians have demonstrated plenty, and which allowed them to launch a successful counter-offensive last year.\n\nBut the war has thus far been fought conventionally on Ukrainian territory, allowing the greater Russian firepower to overwhelm Ukraine’s smaller military and destroy much of its economy.\n\nThese setbacks have not deterred the US and its allies from doubling down. On May 19, the US-led G7 countries meeting in Hiroshima vowed to renew their “commitment to provide the financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support Ukraine requires for as long as it takes”.\n\nThis is yet another indication that the US and its allies are getting bogged down in “mission creep”. What began with sending ammunition to Ukraine, expanded to supplying artillery and American and German tanks, Patriot defence systems, and drones, which allow Ukraine to take the fight into Russian territory.\n\nMost recently, the US has agreed to the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine to challenge Russia’s air superiority. Moscow has warned that providing Kyiv with this aircraft will lead to a dangerous escalation, while experts have questioned its immediate utility for the Ukrainian army without outside help manning it.\n\nFrom the looks of it, any future victory on the battlefield may prove to be a pyrrhic one, with the costs by far outweighing the gains. If the much-awaited Ukrainian counteroffensive somehow succeeds in extracting a dramatic victory from the jaws of defeat, this could push Russia to use nuclear weapons in response, wreaking havoc in Ukraine and the rest of Europe.\n\nEven if Moscow resorts to deploying tactical nuclear weapons, which have smaller explosive power and are meant for use on the battlefield against enemy bases and troops, the ramification of such a move for European – indeed world – security and peace, cannot be overstated.\n\nSome in the US administration consider the Russian threats of nuclear retaliation as no more than a bluff to deter further Western intervention.\n\nI hope they are right. I think they are wrong.\n\nSince 2000, the Kremlin has lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, stating that they may be used not only in case of a threat to the country’s very existence, but also “to repel armed aggression if all other means of resolving a crisis situation have been exhausted or turn out to be ineffective”.\n\nLastly, just as Putin underestimated Western unity in their support of Ukraine, Biden underestimated the rest of the world’s indifference to what appears – from the perspective of the Global South – as a protracted European conflict that is Europe’s problem. As the rest of the world continues to trade with Russia, Western sanctions are failing to change Moscow’s calculus.\n\nIn sum, both Russia and the West have failed to pursue diplomacy as purposefully and stubbornly as they have pursued war. Both sides are digging in for the long haul, stacking the decks, stoking fears of nuclear annihilation, and framing the conflict as a “win or die” situation. Considering the irreconcilable differences between Russia and the West, the war is not likely to end in a peace agreement, at least not in the foreseeable future.\n\nUltimately, the conflict may reach a stalemate and a long-term cessation of hostilities, similar to the 70-year-long ceasefire between North and South Korea, in which Russia may insist on a demilitarised zone that cuts through Ukraine from Kharkiv in the north to Kherson in the south.\n\nMeanwhile, as the war takes its toll on Russian and Western security and stability, China emerges unscathed. And to US displeasure, it is becoming a more powerful and credible world leader than ever before.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-12-03/joe-biden-israel-hamas-gaza-ukraine-russia', 'Headline': 'Opinion: Does Biden benefit if foreign policy dominates the 2024 ...', 'Snippet': 'One might think a president with Joe Biden’s experience would perform well in a foreign policy election.

Opinion polls regularly show that international issues take a back seat to topics more prosaic (economics, education) or provocative (culture wars, gun control).\n\nNext year’s presidential election, however, might be a bit different. Continued international crises could focus attention on the benefits and burdens of American global leadership, and our polarized politics may turn on battles and events far from home. We might experience the rare phenomenon: a foreign policy election.\n\nIsrael’s war against Hamas has become a domestic political focal point, either praised as a righteous campaign of self-defense or criticized for bringing humanitarian catastrophe to Gaza. Some experts now believe Ukraine’s war aims are “out of reach,” and call on Washington to encourage Ukraine to pursue a cease-fire.\n\nOne might think a president with Joe Biden’s experience would perform well in a foreign policy election. So it’s surprising that his approach to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine — an approach he doubled down on in a recent op-ed that touted the U.S. as “the essential nation,” worried about Russian leader Vladimir “Putin’s drive for conquest” and reduced Hamas’ motives to “murderous nihilism” — instead appears to be endangering his reelection.\n\nHamas’ Oct. 7 attacks and the president’s nearly unconditional support for Israel’s response have brought to a boil the simmering divisions within the Democratic Party on the issue of Palestinians. Many young, diverse and progressive voters are critical of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and the “open-air prison” of Gaza. They believe the Gaza war is unjust and disproportionate.\n\nFully 70% of U.S. voters under age 35 disapprove of Biden’s handling of the war, according to a Nov. 19 NBC News poll. Other polls show that a majority of young voters do not support sending weapons to Israel, and less than half of Gen Z and millennials even want the U.S. to publicly voice support for Israel as the president has so consistently done. The issue could tip the scale in the crucial swing states, such as Michigan, where razor-thin margins of victory are common.\n\nSupport for Israel has been uncontroversial for most of Biden’s political career. A decade ago, a pro-Israel lobbyist described his work to me as “pushing against an open door.” But as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has moved to the right and threatened Israel’s democratic institutions, he has infuriated many Israelis and tested the patience of otherwise sympathetic Americans — including many American Jews. Today, Washington’s pro-Israel lobby is dominated by evangelical Christians in the Republican Party base, borne by what one commentator called “solidarity with a particularly aggressive strain of Zionism.”\n\nDemocrats have sweated the electoral consequences of being seen as insufficiently pro-Israel since before it was even a country. In 1947, as the United Nations considered recognizing a Jewish state, President Truman’s general counsel, Clark Clifford, penned a private memo to his boss: “Unless the Palestine matter is boldly and favorably handled, there is bound to be some defection on [Jewish voters’] part to the alert [GOP nominee Thomas E.] Dewey.” Unlike Truman, Biden has to contend with a voting Middle Eastern diaspora, new human rights norms and mass media capable of relaying round-the-clock images of Palestinian suffering.\n\nApart from the Israel-Hamas war, a foreign policy election would present Biden with other fresh challenges. In broad terms, independent voters don’t seem to share Democrats’ — and the president’s — expansive view of the purpose of American power.\n\nA survey released in October by the Institute for Global Affairs at the Eurasia Group found that Republicans and independents, when asked what the primary goal of U.S. foreign policy should be, chose “to protect America from foreign threats and stop other countries from taking advantage of the U.S.” Democrats, on the other hand, chose “to promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law across the globe as the leader of the free world.”\n\nWhen House Republicans recently cut Ukraine funding from a plan to keep the government running, they elicited howls from some Democrats about “abandoning” Ukraine. But independents aren’t howling. The survey shows that many share Republicans’ skepticism of alliances, concern over diminishing weapons stockpiles and desire to withdraw U.S. troops stationed in Europe.\n\nIn other words, independents echo the rhetoric of Donald Trump more than that of Joe Biden. The president has lately dialed down his trumpeting of a worldwide “battle between democracy and autocracy.” Perhaps his campaign realized this resonated with those inclined to vote for him anyway, and could fail to win over swing voters.\n\nHistorically, a foreign policy election benefits the incumbent. During the Cold War, politics were said to stop at the water’s edge, as Americans sought to show the world a united front. International crises often generated a “rally ’round the flag” effect for leaders seen as taking decisive action.\n\nHowever, voters today don’t agree on the dangers the U.S. faces, let alone the best way to address them. Republicans’ greatest perceived threat — immigration threatens the country’s national identity — ranked last among Democrats on our survey. Climate -change-induced natural disasters were seen as the top threat among Democrats, but the second-to-last among Republicans.\n\nPolitical leaders can usually be forgiven for not heeding the public’s foreign policy preferences. Voters can be capricious or ill-informed, and expertise is crucial for foreign policy decision-making. But if foreign crises continue to focus Americans’ attention next year, Biden ignores their views at his peril.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/opinion/biden-russia-ukraine-china.html', 'Headline': 'Opinion | Biden’s Cautious Foreign Policy Is Imperiling the United ...', 'Snippet': 'The Biden White House may claim that surprises like China’s nuclear weapons breakout and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine required major revisions to U.S. strategy.

We chose sovereignty,” he said, rousingly. “We stood with Ukraine.” In the aftermath of Vladimir Putin’s recent nuclear threat and call-up of reservists, it was reassuring for the leader of the free world to be unflinching.\n\nRhetoric aside, the administration has signaled in numerous other ways that Mr. Putin’s threats have constrained support for Ukraine. Mr. Biden’s foreign policy team speaks of putting up guardrails in the conflict and congratulates themselves on their slow increase in assistance not provoking Mr. Putin. Government officials tell journalists they’ve been sending private warnings for months to the Russians about nuclear use, yet the president himself sounds anxious publicly, repeatedly asserting, “We’re trying to avoid World War III.” We have let Russian threats determine our actions, which encourages Russia and others to test our resolve.\n\nThe problem is even larger than it looks. Twenty months into the administration, there is no public National Security Strategy. That makes it difficult for Congress to align spending to strategy, and difficult for allies to align their policies to support ours. All of the downstream strategy directives, including the National Defense Strategy and the National Military Strategy, are hostage to delays on the National Security Strategy. Even within the administration, there is no binding guidance, to take a recent example, inhibiting the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, from opposing the administration’s proposal to cancel a new nuclear cruise missile (which Congress sustained over White House objections).\n\nThe Biden White House may claim that surprises like China’s nuclear weapons breakout and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine required major revisions to U.S. strategy. Good strategy hedges against uncertainties such as these, so it is the deficiency of the Biden administration’s strategy and its lack of foresight — not the events that derailed it — that are to blame.\n\nThe gap between what the administration is claiming as its foreign policy objectives, and what it is actually willing to do, is a serious problem for American security, for Russia and beyond. In mid-September President Biden said for the fourth time that should China invade Taiwan, the United States would send troops to defend it. And, for the fourth time, administration officials claimed this obvious change in policy represented no change in policy.\n\nThe Biden administration bungling its messaging is bad enough. But worse are the real gaps in capability that call into question whether the United States could indeed defend Taiwan. The ships, troop numbers, planes and missile defenses in the Pacific are a poor match for China’s capability. The director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, has assessed that the threat to Taiwan between now and 2030 is “acute,” yet the defense budget is not geared to providing improved capabilities until the mid-2030s. More broadly, the Biden administration isn’t funding an American military that can adequately carry out our defense commitments, a dangerous posture for a great power. The Democratic-led Congress added $29 billion last year and $45 billion this year to the Department of Defense budget request, a measure of just how inadequate the Biden budget is.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Later that day comes the symbolic highlight of the trip, the grand state dinner at the White House, an honor President Joe Biden has granted to only two others since he took office – the presidents of US allies France and South Korea.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that the man for whom Washington is rolling out the red carpet is the same one it banned from entering the United States in 2005. His diplomatic visa was denied after the state he led, Gujarat, became the scene of anti-Muslim riots that left hundreds dead. An investigation cleared Modi, and he later became prime minister, a position he has held since 2014.\n\nModi remains controversial – so controversial that more than 70 congressional Democrats wrote Biden a letter urging him to bring up human rights abuses with Modi – but a meaningful strengthening of the relationship between the US and India could create a powerhouse of an alliance, precisely in the place and at the time when it is most needed.\n\nIndeed, Biden will likely be accused of hypocrisy for playing down issues of human rights and democracy erosion under Modi, both accusations that Modi claims are false. But the times – with Russia’s raging invasion of Ukraine and China raising its anti-western military profile – call for a measure of realpolitik.\n\nImagine the US, the world’s biggest economy with the strongest military force, joining forces with India, the planet’s most populous country and the world’s largest – if very flawed – democracy, situated in one of the globe’s most strategic locations.\n\nTo drape Modi in honors, Washington is making a cold calculation. There is little question Indian democracy has been receding. Though Modi’s administration denies it, human rights organizations say discrimination against Muslims has worsened under Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Journalists say they are being muzzled, and opposition politicians are facing prosecutions.\n\nThe former leader of the opposition party, Rahul Gandhi, heir to India’s founding dynasty, was sentenced to two years in prison for disparaging the name “Modi.” As a result, he was expelled from Parliament, effectively removed from politics ahead of next year’s elections. Gandhi is currently appealing the sentence.\n\nAnd yet, India’s fragile democracy is far ahead of others in its vicinity – the ones that most concern the US.\n\nIt’s not even close.\n\nThe democracy watchdog Freedom House rates India as “partly free.” But it does call it a “multiparty democracy.” Compare that to neighboring China, rated “not free”, and described by Freedom House as an “authoritarian regime” that “has become increasingly repressive.” Or Russia to the north, also rated “not free” and described by Freedom House as an “authoritarian political system” where power is “concentrated in the hands of President Vladimir Putin.”\n\nLeadership means making tradeoffs, and the Biden administration, which has made the quest to stop democratic backsliding a key element of its foreign policy, has already decided how to play this. It is framing the decision by acknowledging the challenges that even the US has endured.\n\n“India and the United States are big, complicated countries,” Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said in a recent speech. Both countries have to work to “strengthen our democracies [a US goal], to unleash the full potential of our people [an Indian goal]” but, he concluded, “the trajectory of this partnership is unmistakable, and it is filled with promise.”\n\nBiden will not turn a blind eye to the more unsettling aspects of Modi’s rule. Officials say Biden will raise the issue of India’s human rights record and democracy backsliding, but it’s likely they will be downplayed. After all, putting human rights publicly at the heart of relations with Saudi Arabia did little more than open the region’s door to China.\n\nHigher on the agenda will be another item of disagreement: Russia. Modi has offered only mild criticism of Putin’s invasion, using the crisis to load up on cut-rate Russian oil. In fact, India increased its purchases of Russian oil ten-fold in 2022, the year the war started. Away from the cameras, Biden will also press Modi on both oil and weapons purchases from Russia, urging him to curtail those purchases.\n\nBiden will try to draw India closer to the US and its allies, and away from Russia and its authoritarian friend, China, which is also a contentious rival of India – their military forces arrayed eye-to-eye at their shared border high in the Himalayas.\n\nMeanwhile, Modi needs to boost India’s economic performance. India has pulled hundreds of millions out of poverty, but its economic growth rate has been much slower than neighboring China’s. Despite being home to some of the world’s wealthiest moguls, India is also home to the world’s largest number of poor people.\n\nModi – and India – need to raise living standards. Only then can they count themselves truly successful. And, for that, stronger ties with the US could be pivotal.\n\nIn addition, Modi also wants stronger military ties, especially in view of its tense relationship with China. That process has already started, with the Biden administration reenergizing the so-called Quad, a Washington-led bloc of Pacific and Indian Ocean powers: Australia, Japan, India and the United States.\n\nIf all goes well, the sounds of Modi practicing yoga in New York one day, speaking at the Capitol the next and later being feted at the White House, could mark a new beginning in a history-making relationship – one with far-reaching consequences.'}}",93.92857142857143,2

However, what is making waves is a whistleblower named Brook Jackson. She claims that in September 2020, when she was hired to oversee the testing of a COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer, criminal fraud occurred, allowing the vaccine to be FDA-approved.\n\nThe questions which have been asked the most since these allegations became public are:\n\nWhat criminal fraud was committed?\n\nIs there anything mentioned in the lawsuit that could be deemed criminal fraud?\n\nAre there holes in Ms. Jackson's claims?\n\nWhile there are issues with mishandling biohazard materials during the testing process, is that enough to constitute a data integrity breach?\n\nYou might find the issues brought up by Professor Dorit Rubenstein Reiss of the University of California Hastings College of Law quite interesting. Do you think that Reiss has created massive holes in the claims stated by Ms. Jackson? As far as we can tell, Jackson or her legal team has not addressed these holes. You can read them here.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that just because Jackson or her legal team has not addressed the holes does not mean they are legit.\n\nOthers have wondered why Ms. Jackson went to BMJ.com to break the story, a UK company instead of one in the US. Was no media outlet willing to break the story because they felt it lacked objective evidence?\n\nHow much does it pay to sue Big Pharma? A lot. If the government intervenes, the relator (the official designation of the whistleblower) can expect 15-25% of the amount the government recovers. The highest recorded payout to a whistleblower is $32 million. And if the government agrees with Jackson, her payout could be substantially more.\n\nThe Key Players\n\nPfizer Inc. - is the manufacturer of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. On August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the vaccine as safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 for individuals 12 or older. The vaccine is currently marketed under the name Comirnaty. The FDA ruled no problem with the data submitted, and no criminal fraud was committed.\n\nVentavia Research Group (VRG) - The independent lab tested the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. According to their website, they have eight locations in Texas: Houston, Fort Worth, Plano, Arlington, Keller, Burleson, Weatherford, and Grapevine. They have just under 100 employees and have performed clinical trial research since 2013.\n\nThe FDA has not taken any action against Ventavia and fully accepted the data from the vaccine testing performed at Ventavia facilities. Wouldn't it make sense if there was an actual problem that the FDA would have taken action? But they didn't.\n\nBrook Jackson - Known as The COVID-19 Pfizer Whistleblower who reported her findings to the FDA on September 25, 2020. Jackson states she has audio recordings and copies of company documents backing up her claims about how VRG conducted the vaccine trial.\n\nOne photo allegedly shows needles used in the vaccine trial had been discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of the approved sharps container box. It is unclear if the used needles were poking through the plastic bag creating a potential injury to anyone handling the bag or near it. Another photo shows the potential of unblinding the participants as the completed vaccine packing materials contained the trial participants' identification numbers, which were out in the open instead of in a secured location.\n\nDoes this sound like criminal fraud to you? Does it paint a picture of a lack of training? Yes. How about that when overworked employees often make mistakes they wouldn't under normal circumstances? That would be probable.\n\nPaul Thacker - the reporter responsible for breaking the story, is described as an American journalist who has reported on science, medicine, and the environment. He has just 16k followers on Twitter. Does that seem like a lot to you? And according to Science.org, fake news is shared 70% more often on Twitter than real news.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/the-miracle-that-wasnt-texas-ag-ken-paxton-sues-pfizer-for-not-ending-covid-19-pandemic-fast-enough/', 'Headline': 'Texas AG Ken Paxton sues Pfizer over COVID-19 vaccines - Law & Crime', 'Snippet': 'When it began making those claims, Pfizer possessed on average only two months of clinical trial data from which to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated persons.

Paxton alleged that the true effectiveness of the vaccine amounted to a mere 0.85%.\n\nPaxton alleged that Pfizer “deceived the public” with overstatements of the vaccine’s efficacy that were “highly misleading from day one.” He said the “false, deceptive, and misleading acts and practices” on Pfizer’s behalf constituted a violation the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\n\nThe complaint idiomatically touted the evidence on which Paxton’s claim is based:\n\nHere, the proof is in the pudding. While Pfizer’s 95% figure made its vaccines seem highly effective, the truth was quite different. When it began making those claims, Pfizer possessed on average only two months of clinical trial data from which to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. Of 17,000 placebo recipients, only 162 acquired COVID-19 during this two-month period. Based on those numbers, vaccination status had a negligible impact on whether a trial participant contracted COVID-19. The risk of acquiring COVID-19 was so small in the first instance during this short window that Pfizer’s vaccine only fractionally improved a person’s risk of infection. And a vaccine recipient’s absolute risk reduction — the federal Food & Drug Administration’s (FDA) preferred efficacy metric — showed that the vaccine was merely 0.85% effective. Moreover, according to Pfizer’s own data, preventing one COVID-19 case required vaccinating 119. That was the simple truth. But Pfizer’s fusillade of public representations bore no resemblance to reality.\n\nMoreover, Paxton said, Pfizer profited “enormously” from its ineffective vaccine, then, “labeled as ‘criminals’ those who spread facts about the vaccine,” and asked that the company be made to repay its allegedly ill-gotten gains.\n\nOver 54 pages, Paxton described Pfizer’s alleged misdeeds along with all manner of COVID-19 statistics to underscore its point that Pfizer reaped billions in profits with its inflated boasts of the vaccine’s utility.\n\nThe complaint even included a meme (shown below) shared online by Pfizer in November 2021.\n\nThe complaint requested that the court order Pfizer to stop making misrepresentations about its COVID-19 vaccine and that the company pay Texas over $10 million in damages and court fees that are specifically deemed not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n\nPfizer was the first pharmaceutical company to have its COVID-19 vaccine approved by the federal government for use during the coronavirus pandemic. Although the COVID-19 crisis has largely passed, Texas conservatives have recently taken aim at vaccine mandates, with the state legislature having passed legislation in October banning mandates without exception for health care facilities.\n\n“We are pursuing justice for the people of Texas, many of whom were coerced by tyrannical vaccine mandates to take a defective product sold by lies,” said Paxton in a statement Thursday. “The facts are clear. Pfizer did not tell the truth about their COVID-19 vaccines. Whereas the Biden Administration weaponized the pandemic to force illegal public health decrees on the public and enrich pharmaceutical companies, I will use every tool I have to protect our citizens who were misled and harmed by Pfizer’s actions.”\n\nA representative from Pfizer said in an email that the company believes Texas’ case has no merit and will respond to the petition in court in due course.\n\nThe statement continued as follows:\n\nPfizer is deeply committed to the well-being of the patients it serves and has no higher priority than the safety and effectiveness of its treatments and vaccines. Since its initial authorization by FDA in December 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been administered to more than 1.5 billion people, demonstrated a favorable safety profile in all age groups, and helped protect against severe COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalization and death. The representations made by the company about its COVID-19 vaccine have been accurate and science-based.\n\nPaxton is currently awaiting trial on two counts of felony securities fraud. If convicted, he faces up to 99 years in prison. Trial is scheduled for April.\n\nPaxton was acquitted of bribery and corruption charges in September. He stood accused not only of corruption, but also of obstructing justice in the criminal case pending against him, issuing improper grand jury subpoenas, and violating state whistleblower laws by firing employees who reported his misconduct.\n\nPaxton is not the only Republican official to vilify Pfizer over its vaccines. In 2022, Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis filed a petition to empanel a statewide grand jury to investigate whether members of the pharmaceutical industry committed crimes by recommending that people get COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nTo read the Texas petition, click here.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/after-5-year-wait-boston-judge-rules-20-mln-whistleblower-fee-spat-2023-12-15/', 'Headline': 'After 5-year wait, Boston judge rules in $20 mln whistleblower fee spat', 'Snippet': 'Those trials included the Pfizer fee case.

""The facts are clear. Pfizer did not tell the truth about their COVID-19 vaccines.""\n\nIn all, Paxton\'s 54-page complaint acts as a compendium of pandemic-era anti-vaccine misinformation and tropes while making a slew of unsupported claims. But, central to the Lone Star State\'s shaky legal argument is one that centers on the standard math Pfizer used to assess the effectiveness of its vaccine: a calculation of relative risk reduction.\n\nThis argument is as unoriginal as it is incorrect. Anti-vaccine advocates have championed this flawed math-based theory since the height of the pandemic. Actual experts have roundly debunked it many times. Still, it appears in all its absurd glory in Paxton\'s lawsuit last week, which seeks $10 million in reparations.\n\nMath argument\n\nBriefly, the lawsuit and the anti-vaccine rhetoric before it argues that Pfizer should have presented its vaccine\'s effectiveness in terms of absolute risk reduction rather than relative risk reduction. Doing so would have made the highly effective COVID-19 vaccine appear extremely ineffective. Based on relative risk reduction in a two-month trial, Pfizer\'s vaccine appeared 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19—as Pfizer advertised. Using the same trial data but calculating absolute risk reduction, however, the vaccine effectiveness would have been 0.85 percent.\n\nThe difference between the two calculations is quite simple: Absolute risk reduction is a matter of subtraction—the percentage point drop in risk of a disease between an untreated and treated group. So, for example, if a group of untreated people have a 60 percent risk of developing a disease, but, when treated, the risk drops to 10 percent, the absolute risk reduction is 50 percent (60 – 10 = 50).\n\nRelative risk reduction involves division—the percent change difference between the two groups\' risks. So, as in the previous example, if a treatment lowers disease risk from 60 percent to 10 percent, the relative risk reduction is 83 percent (50 percent drop / 60 percent initial risk = ~0.83).\n\nBoth numbers can be helpful when weighing the risks and benefits of treatments, but absolute risk reduction is particularly key when there\'s a low risk of a disease. This can be easily understood by simply moving the decimal in the above example. If a treatment lowers a person\'s disease risk from 6 percent to 1 percent, the relative risk reduction is still 83 percent—an impressive number that might argue for treatment—but the absolute risk reduction is a paltry 5 percent—which could easily be negated by any potential side effects or high costs.\n\nCalculation context\n\nSimilar calculations were seen in Pfizer\'s trial: Of 17,411 vaccinated people, eight developed COVID-19 during the trial (0.045 percent), while 162 of 17,511 people in the placebo group developed the infection (0.9 percent). The relative risk reduction is 95 percent, while the absolute risk reduction is a decidedly unimpressive 0.85 percent.\n\nFor this reason, anti-vaccine advocates have seized upon absolute risk calculations as a way to downplay the effectiveness of lifesaving vaccines. But this steamrolls over the reason relative risk is used to examine vaccine effectiveness against infectious disease. Absolute risk is most helpful when it\'s relatively stable and can be confidently calculated, such as calculating the risk of cardiovascular disease in a person, given their blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In these cases, absolute risk reduction is very helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment. But using absolute risk for infectious diseases is often simply nonsensical because absolute risk can vary dramatically by space, time, and many other factors.\n\nFor instance, a person\'s absolute risk of flu drops significantly when it\'s not flu season. Or, if a person hops on a plane, traveling from an area with no endemic malaria directly into an area with a raging malaria outbreak, their absolute risk of infection will skyrocket when they land. And, of course, if people are under lockdowns or health restrictions—as was the case early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Pfizer\'s vaccine trials were running—their absolute risk can rise significantly when those lockdowns and restrictions are lifted—as was the case in 2021 after the vaccine\'s release.\n\nWith absolute risk so variable, relative risk is a more helpful measure of a vaccine\'s effectiveness—and the relative risk reduction applies regardless of what a person\'s absolute risk is at a given point in time.\n\nArtificial numbers\n\nAnother key reason it\'s safe to ignore absolute risk reduction in vaccine trial data is that it is often entirely artificial. These trials are designed to enroll large numbers of people with the full knowledge that only a small percentage will be exposed during the trial. And they\'re designed with trigger points—in other words, when the trial hits a pre-determined number of infections, effectiveness is calculated.\n\nIn Pfizer\'s trial, the trigger point was at or around 170. But, if the trial runners had set the trigger point somewhere else, the absolute risk reduction could easily have been different, even if everything else was the same. For instance, if it was set to 510 and there were 24 cases in the vaccine groups (0.13 percent) and 486 cases in the placebo group (2.8 percent), the relative risk reduction would still be 95 percent, but the absolute risk reduction would be 2.67 percent, not 0.85 percent.\n\nIf Pfizer had waited for all 35,000 or so people in the trial to be exposed to COVID-19 amid widespread lockdowns, it would have needlessly delayed the evaluation and release of the vaccines.\n\nAn analysis from last year estimated that COVID-19 vaccines prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and more than 3 million deaths in the first two years after their release.\n\nIn a statement to Stat, Pfizer noted the benefits and safety of its vaccine, saying that its representations of its vaccine ""have been accurate and science-based. [Pfizer] believes that the state’s case has no merit and will respond to the petition in court in due course.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/10/scicheck-its-not-news-nor-scandalous-that-pfizer-trial-didnt-test-transmission/', 'Headline': ""It's Not News, Nor 'Scandalous,' That Pfizer Trial Didn't Test ..."", 'Snippet': 'The Moderna and Novavax phase 3 trials each included about 30,000 volunteers, while the Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson trials included about 44,000 each.

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E.

Walensky, MD, MPH\n\nDirector\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nDear Secretary Austin, Commissioner Califf, and Director Walensky:\n\nNine Department of Defense (DoD) whistleblowers recently provided my office with information that raises questions about the manufacturing and labeling of COVID-19 vaccines distributed to service members.[1] These new whistleblower allegations must be fully addressed by DoD, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nLt. Chad Coppin, who is a commissioned officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, disclosed that on June 10, 2022, his base located in Juneau, Alaska received “a shipment of 60 Comirnaty vials packaged in six boxes of ten vials.”[2] These vials included the vaccine lot number FW1331.[3] Lt. Coppin noted that, “[p]rior to this date, only emergency use authorization shots [had] been available[.]”[4] Lt. Coppin provided my office with pictures of one of the Comirnaty vials and boxes his base received:\n\nPictures of Comirnaty Vial (taken on June 10, 2022)\n\nPictures of Comirnaty Box (taken on June 10, 2022)\n\nLt. Coppin reported that he attempted to determine the shipping and manufacturing locations of these specific vaccines.[5] He explained to my office that the medical staff at his base informed him that the vials were shipped from Ft. Detrick in Maryland.[6] Lt. Coppin stated that he contacted Ft. Detrick to ask about the manufacturing location of the vials and was told that these vials came from a “Pfizer plant” located in Kalamazoo, Michigan.[7]\n\nLt. Coppin then called Pfizer directly to ask about the manufacturing location of the specific vaccine lot number for these vials: FW1331.[8] A Pfizer customer service representative apparently told him that this lot was manufactured in France on January 28, 2022 and expires on December 31, 2022.[9] Lt. Coppin disclosed to my office that, “The significance of the France manufacturing location is that it is not an authorized manufacturing location as per the FDA’s Comirnaty [Biologics License Application (BLA)] Supplement Approval letter dated December 16, 2021.”[10] That letter approved a “30 microgram dose formulation (Tris/Sucrose) of Comirnaty” to be manufactured at the “Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium NV, Purrs, Belgium facility.”[11] Any Comirnaty vaccine lots that are manufactured outside of the FDA-approved manufacturing locations and distributed to U.S citizens raises significant legal and health-related concerns.\n\nIn addition to the lack of clarity relating to the manufacturing location of vaccine lot FW1331, another DoD whistleblower raised questions about whether this specific vaccine lot is mislabeled as “Comirnaty.” 1Lt. Mark Bashaw, who is a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army, found that the lot number contained on these “Comirnaty” vials—FW1331—matched a lot number on a CDC database listing Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) vaccine lots.[12]\n\nAccording to CDC, this database, which is called the COVID-19 Vaccine Lot Number and Expiration Date Report, “contain[s] all lots for COVID-19 vaccines made available under [EUA] for distribution in the United States.”[13] 1Lt. Bashaw disclosed to my office that he downloaded this database and found that it included vaccine lot FW1331.[14] DoD, FDA, and CDC must provide a thorough explanation for why a vaccine lot with the “Comirnaty” label would be listed on a database that is meant to display vaccine lots associated with the EUA.\n\nLt. Coppin, 1Lt. Bashaw, and the additional seven DoD whistleblowers who brought this information to my attention have exercised their right to talk to Congress. Any retaliatory actions taken against these individuals will not be tolerated and will be investigated immediately. DoD, FDA, and CDC owe our service members complete transparency regarding the COVID-19 vaccines that the Biden administration has forced upon them. With this in mind, I request that you provide the following information:\n\nWas vaccine lot FW1331 manufactured at the Pfizer facility located in Belgium? If not, why not?\n\nWhy is vaccine lot FW1331, which is labeled “Comirnaty,” listed on a CDC database (“COVID-19 Vaccine Lot Number and Expiration Date Report”) for EUA vaccine lots?\n\nWas vaccine lot FW1331 created under the EUA? If so, why is it labeled “Comirnaty”?\n\nPlease identify the vaccine lot numbers, in addition to FW1331, that are labeled “Comirnaty” and have been distributed to U.S. military bases and are also listed on CDC’s “COVID-19 Vaccine Lot Number and Expiration Date Report.”\n\nPlease provide this information as soon as possible but no later than September 1, 2022. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,'}}",100.0,2

From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-Covid', 'Headline': 'Zero-COVID - Wikipedia', 'Snippet': 'Zero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-31709-2', 'Headline': '\ufeffA global analysis of the effectiveness of policy responses to COVID-19', 'Snippet': 'Facial coverings have the highest impact at 8.8% and play an important role in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases within a period of approximately one month, while also being the most cost ...', 'Full_text': ""Background\n\nCOVID-19 is generally believed to have originated in Wuhan, China in late 20191. By the 11th of March 2020, the virus had been detected in 114 countries across the world and was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO)2. Government responses to the pandemic have varied dramatically with time3,4. For federal governments like that of the United States of America, these variations in responses are present even at the state level5. Following the declaration of a pandemic by WHO, there were widespread global lockdowns in March of 2020. More disparate measures were implemented in countries across the globe over the following months. These varying policy responses produced different outcomes not just in terms of how the virus spread, but also with regard to how different individuals reacted to restrictions, adverse effects on national economies6, and decreasing the personal well-being of billions of people across the planet, especially with respect to the declining mental health of people during lockdowns7,8.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe wide variation in policy responses to COVID-19 across countries can largely be attributed to a global lack of experience in dealing with pandemics at this scale. COVID-19 forced many countries to adopt various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as community mitigation strategies. NPIs are actions taken, besides the use of medicine and vaccines, to flatten the disease transmission curve9. While NPIs have proved to be important in mitigating the spread of the virus and ensuing deaths over time, and across waves10,11, certain policies had terrible effects on national economies, from which some nations are still yet to recover12,13,14.\n\nIn this paper, we perform a global analysis of various policies rolled out by governments. We study the effect that these policies had on the spread of the virus while taking into account the socioeconomic factors at play. We seek to provide models and evidence for guiding effective government policies in the early (pre-vaccination) stages of a pandemic to yield the highest compliance from citizens without severely compromising the economy and quality of life of people needlessly.\n\nObjectives\n\nIn this paper, we seek to answer the following four research questions.\n\n1.\n\nHow did COVID-19 (cases and deaths) and stringent policies affect mobility?\n\n2.\n\nWhich policy measures are most effective for managing COVID-19?\n\n3.\n\nWhat are the influences of socioeconomic and demographic factors?\n\n4.\n\nHow has compliance changed with the emergence of variants?\n\nLiterature review\n\nCOVID-19 has had far-reaching global effects, leading to a worldwide concerted effort to curate relevant data and generate research necessary to understand the virus, responses, and eventual outcomes.\n\nAs Berger et al.15 note, governments all over the world were faced with the arduous task of making policy decisions under high levels of uncertainty in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus, and when that failed, they had to make more tough decisions on the timing, duration and intensity of interventions to minimize case counts and mortality, primarily through attempts to enforce social distancing and consequently reduce transmission rates6. This is commonly referred to as “flattening the curve”, and according to a forecasting study on the United States of America16, could have potentially resulted in benefits valued at about $5.2 trillion if implemented effectively.\n\nIn the pre-vaccination stage of the pandemic, the policies implemented by governments were NPIs rolled out at country and state levels with different levels of enforcement 7,11. One of the policies most advocated for was the use of facial coverings, and primarily, nose masks17,18. According to Mitze et al.19 not only did face masks considerably reduce COVID-19 cases in Germany, achieving a 45% reduction in a span of 20 days, but they also have negligible economic costs when compared to other public health measures.\n\nWith what is hopefully the worst of the pandemic behind us, we, as a planet, are trying to adapt to life with COVID-19; what many have called a “new normal”20,21. However, while we have learned to live with COVID-19, experts still warn of the possibility of future pandemics22,23. It is imperative that we learn as much as we can about the optimal blend of policies for addressing a pandemic based on our experience with the novel coronavirus during the last two years. It is especially important to understand the efficacy of different policies that are meant to address the effects of the virus in the period before vaccines are available. This allows us to prepare ourselves for the possibility of future pandemics.\n\nRetrospective studies performed at a country level have helped to assess the effectiveness of certain policies against COVID-19. For example, the use of facial coverings has been found to be most effective and cost-effective in Germany19. Azman and Luquero24 suggest that China’s extreme lockdowns, active case surveillance, and other rapid control measures led to substantial reductions in transmission as of late March 2020, although this was at the expense of the social and emotional well-being of many and has resulted in slower economic growth. In Rwanda, in addition to early action and effective use of social media for information dissemination, robots were employed for patient monitoring in hospitals25.\n\nConsidering that the operational contexts of every country are different and that certain policies cannot be readily transferred, it becomes necessary to take a holistic look at the policies on a multinational scale to test empirically which ones perform adequately regardless of the country in question. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) attempted such an analysis26 but was limited to just 18 out of its 38 member states. Their paper acknowledged the role of income support and debt relief as motivating factors for people required to stay at home but raised the issue of poor targeting in terms of who needed this kind of support the most, and whether they had the right access. This is in line with assertions that an understanding of socioeconomic variations in government and citizen responses is required for pandemic governance27. The OECD finally concedes the need for extra investigations to make the right policy recommendations for member states. A study of 37 countries examined the effectiveness of policies in response to the first COVID-19 outbreak and found that the greater the strength of government interventions at an early stage, the more effective these are in slowing down or reversing the growth rate of deaths28.\n\nContribution\n\nIn this paper, we move past learnings from single countries and international economic organisations like the OECD to pursue a truly global view of the effects of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of NPI mitigation policies using data available through the Our World In Data (OWID) platform.\n\nThrough our investigations, we provide an empirical analysis of the effects of government policies on the spread of the virus, while taking into account the effects of socio-economic factors on the general compliance of citizens, especially with regard to mobility-limiting restrictions, which can have severe economic consequences.\n\nWe quantify compliance as the correlation between stringency and relative residential mobility; the relative amount of time people spend at home, as provided by Google mobility trends. Stringency, as used in this paper, refers to policy response combinations adopted by governments to reduce and manage the spread of COVID-19 by limiting contact between citizens. A stringency index, recording the strictness of 'lockdown style' policies that primarily restrict people's behaviour is computed by the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) project29,30. We give further details in the data sub-section of our methodology section. Our focus on quantifying compliance is of particular interest to policymakers as failure to effectively change mobility patterns weakens the impact of the intervention.\n\nLayout\n\nThe following subsections detail our methods of analysis, including visualisations and regressions performed to generate insights and explain the contributions of certain features to both case numbers and compliance. We then inspect and draw out insights from our results, followed by data-driven recommendations to serve as a policy guide in the event of future pandemics.\n\nData and definitions\n\nThrough a comprehensive aggregation of datasets relevant to COVID-19 on the open-source Our World in Data (OWID) platform29, we had access to COVID-19 case data beginning from 28th January 2020 and government policy responses within the same period30. Besides a few clearly indicated exceptions, all data referenced in this paper was obtained from OWID. Published data on cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 are subject to under-reporting31. In particular, reported cases are likely to be a substantial underestimate of the prevalence of the disease in a population given that most people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, and even among those who are symptomatic, not all are tested. While acknowledging these data limitations, our study focuses on visualising the evolution of the pandemic across several variables, quantifying compliance in terms of reducing mobility and assessing whether or not policies successfully reduced the number of cases.\n\nOur first objective was to assess the effects of COVID-19 on society, policy responses and subsequent changes in mobility. A visual representation is given in Fig. 1. To quantify these effects, we analysed relevant data focusing on five variables of interest.\n\nNew deaths smoothed per million: provides a snapshot of deaths as an intensity metric and how this changes over time across the globe.\n\nMortality ratio (derived as the number of deaths smoothed per million divided by the number of cases smoothed per million): measures how deadly the virus is at any point in time, but strictly in relation to the percentage of people confirmed to have died from COVID-19 at that time.\n\nStringency index: a composite measure of stringency responses by governments based on the OxCGRT index developed to quantify the extent to which restrictions were applied at a governmental level across the nations of the world.\n\nGoogle residential mobility: quantifies the time people spent at home relative to the median value over the five‑week period from January 3rd to February 6th 2020, as captured by Google mobility trends data. This data serves as a measure of the human response to government policies and is our most trustworthy means of empirically determining compliance with mobility restrictions32,33.\n\nVaccination percentage: a snapshot of the percentage of the global population that, in line with the approach of Hallas et al.5, has received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIn addition to these variables, we also had to identify when major variants of the virus were first detected. This data was collected from the official WHO records34, however, only the month and year were provided so we assumed the 15th day of the given month as the date of first detection. Another important date is the 6th of June 2020, when masks were mandated by WHO35.\n\nOur next agenda was to determine the effectiveness of stringency measures implemented by governments. As mentioned earlier, the stringency index is a composite measure, and it aggregates nine different metrics: (1) school closures; (2) workplace closures; (3) cancellation of public events; (4) restrictions on public gatherings; (5) closures of public transport; (6) stay-at-home requirements; (7) public information campaigns; (8) restrictions on internal movements; and (9) international travel controls29. All these stringency metrics are primarily meant to reduce mobility and facilitate social distancing. Masks and facial coverings have also been heavily advocated for and therefore data on facial covering policies is included19. The impact of these policies over time was defined as the negative correlation coefficient between each policy and the percentage change in the number of cases smoothed per million over a given time period.\n\nFinally, we addressed the issue of stringency policy compliance, defined as the correlation between the composite stringency index and the Google residential mobility index. We investigated how compliance could be explained by socioeconomic and demographic factors, taking the following into account: (1) GDP per capita; (2) Life expectancy; (3) Median age29; (4) Literacy rate36; (5) Corruption index37; and (6) Freedom of expression38.\n\nWe applied a log transformation to the GDP per capita, which is a standard normalization method to make the distribution more normal. This is also in line with the popular United Nations human development index39, which is a combination of the log of GDP per capita, life expectancy and an education index40.\n\nLockdown restrictions are economically costly both to states and to individuals and could have a bearing on how well people comply with directives to stay at home or avoid workplaces. As such, we consider the effects of (1) income support and (2) debt relief policies on the predictability of compliance.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient is a statistical standard for measuring the strength of a relationship between two variables. We used it extensively in this paper for calculations of (1) policy compliance, which is assessed using the correlation between stringency indices and Google residential mobility trends, and (2) policy impact, defined as the negative correlation between stringency sub-indices, including policy on facial coverings, and the percentage change in normalised case counts.\n\nConsidering that the COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing for over two years, a certain amount of restriction fatigue5 is expected to have developed over time across different countries, which is consistent with the findings of Petherick et al.41. Fatigue is visually recognized as a dip in compliance over a period of time. Compliance can be measured and tracked over time by applying a rolling average window to calculate the correlation coefficient between stringency and residential mobility. This window needs to be long enough to provide sufficient data for reliable statistics but short enough to capture changes in behaviour. We experimented with different window sizes and found that three months was most effective for this purpose.\n\nWe divided the pandemic window into three major time periods: the uncertainty period (January–March 2020) which represents a break between the normalcy of 2019 and the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic by WHO2; the pre-vaccination period (April–December 2020); and the vaccination period (January 2021 to the present). The analysis below focuses predominantly on the period from 1st April 2020 through 31st December 2020. This was the period before the first major rollout of vaccinations and within which much of the uncertainty associated with the pandemic was decreasing. Essentially, this pre-vaccine period is the most relevant period within which we can assess the effectiveness of different policies. Once the vaccines were rolled out, there was a marked change in behaviour with many people becoming much less risk-averse than they had been previously. It can be argued that this period is therefore a stable period of time for quantifying policy impact and compliance.\n\nTo quantify the average policy impact, I(k), for a period of the following k days, we pooled daily country-level policy index data, x(t), for the pre-vaccination period (1st April through 31st December 2020) and computed the correlation with the relative change, g(t,k), in normalised case counts smoothed per million, y(t), over a period of k days. These calculations were performed on a range of horizons, k, from 0 to 84 days (12 weeks):\n\n$${\\text{I}}\\left( {\\text{k}} \\right) = - {\\text{corr}}\\left( {{\\text{x}}\\left( {\\text{t}} \\right),{\\text{ g}}\\left( {{\\text{t}},{\\text{k}}} \\right)} \\right)$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\text{g}}\\left( {{\\text{t}},{\\text{k}}} \\right) = {\\text{y}}\\left( {{\\text{t}} + {\\text{k}}} \\right)/{\\text{y}}\\left( {\\text{t}} \\right) - {1}$$\n\n(2)\n\nTo assess the influence of socioeconomic and demographic factors on compliance, we ran regressions on a variety of country-level factors within the pre-vaccination period against the average compliance of that country within the same period. We took into account the income support and debt relief indices so as to quantify the effects of these policies on the compliance levels. The results are studied across the globe and on a continent level during the pre-vaccination period. The adjusted R-squared is used as a measure of the goodness of fit for each model.\n\nIn order to ensure the robustness of our regression analyses to potential overfitting we calculated the cross-validated R-squared value by leaving out one country in each fold of our cross-validation technique. Leave-one-out essentially provides an out-of-sample result for each country by estimating the model on the remaining N − 1 countries. Hence this is more computationally intensive than the traditional in-sample approach because instead of fitting a single model, it is now necessary to construct a separate model for each country that is left out. All the results are then combined to provide the final cross-validated R-squared result.\n\nEffects of COVID-19 and policy responses on mobility\n\nFigure 1 gives a global long-term temporal view of the spread of the virus (blue) and the associated mortality rate (red) as well as the average stringency index (green) and the human response in terms of the Google residential mobility index (orange), indicating the relative change in the amount of time people spend at home, compared to the median value for the 5‑week period from 3rd January to 6th February 2020. Super-imposed on all of this is the percentage of the global population with at least one dose of the vaccine (brown). We also divide the graph into separate sections using specific dates of interest, particularly the day on which WHO recommended mask mandates and the dates on which the major variants were estimated to have first been detected.\n\nThe period before April 2020 was marked by a lot of uncertainty about the virus, its transmission, treatment, and prevention, among other things. The first wave of deaths in this period was met by lockdowns and extreme restrictions on mobility, with the global average stringency index reaching a high of 80.83% on 18th April 2020. Just six days after this peak in restrictions, the highest mortality ratio of 6.35% was recorded on 24th April 2020. Eventually, concerted global efforts of restricting human mobility followed by a WHO recommendation for facial coverings (masks) had the desired effect of reducing the mortality rate and keeping it under 2.0%.\n\nAfter the initial lockdowns, there have been more waves of the virus, and while not synchronized across countries, these have been marked by the emergence of different variants: Beta, Delta, and Omicron (Fig. 1). According to WHO34, these variants were estimated to have emerged in May 2020 (Beta), October 2021 (Delta), and November 2021 (Omicron), with Alpha being the originally sequenced variant. Omicron proved to be the most contagious, with cases reaching a record high of over 3.5 million cases in January of 2022.\n\nFrom Tables 1 and 2 we can accurately track the levels and changes that occurred between key dates for these important variables. For example, during the period from when the virus was declared a pandemic on 11th March 2020 until the peak of the mortality ratio of 6.35% experienced on 24th April 2020, the normalized case count grew by 157.85%. This was within the period of the first global lockdown in which more than 100 countries instituted a full or partial lockdown42. The lockdowns led to an 8.21% reduction in the normalised case count and a 2.65% drop in the mortality ratio by the time the Beta variant was detected in May 2020. Throughout this period, compliance was consistently above 80%, indicating that people were actually staying at home and following recommended guidelines.\n\nOn 6th June 2020, WHO officially recommended the use of masks, and in the four months between then and when the Delta variant was first detected in October, the mortality ratio more than halved from 1.99 to 0.92%. Nevertheless, with a drop in compliance from 77.94 to 31.52%, we see a 314% increase in the number of cases in the same period. With the advent of Delta, and moving into the end of 2020 we observe an 18.82% increase in compliance as the mortality ratio climbed back up to 1.76%, suggesting that people’s behaviour, in terms of risk aversion, is largely motivated by the perceived deadliness of the virus at a given time.\n\nIn the eleven months following vaccination rollouts, the mortality ratio dropped back down to 1.09% and compliance saw a corresponding drop to 24.24% despite three waves of the Delta variant. At this point, in November 2021, the Omicron variant emerged, and with it, a 94% surge in the normalised case counts by the end of 2021. However, the mortality ratio dropped to 0.36% and compliance dropped to 21.3% in the same period. It is believed that the Omicron variant is more contagious but less deadly than the Delta variant43.\n\nOmicron went on to reach an all-time high normalised case count of 1158 new cases smoothed per million on 26th January 2022, marking an almost 200% increase in just 26 days. The mortality ratio, however, dropped to 0.19% in that same period. With the continuous drop in mortality ratio throughout 2021 and going into 2022 we see that even though many people became infected and tested positive, the risk of fatality was successfully managed downwards as time progressed.\n\nWith the drop in the mortality ratio, we also see a drop in stringency and a corresponding drop in residential mobility (people staying at home). For example, at the height of the first wave on 24th April 2020, the global average stringency is 79.78% and residential mobility is 20.31%. However, by the last day of 2021 stringency has dropped to 46.29% and residential mobility has declined to 5.46%. The correlation between stringency and residential mobility provides a useful measure of compliance, and the changes in compliance over time demonstrate how human behaviour has varied. The factors influencing compliance are many and of course vary from one person to the next. For example, a UK study44 highlighted increased symptoms of fatigue based among males, the divorced, part-time employees, and/or parents of more than two children during periods of warmer temperature. By considering a number of variables, we can, however, offer some insights about how populations respond in aggregate.\n\nUsing a moving three-month window, we plotted the evolution of compliance over the pre-vaccination period of 2020, using a moving average window of three months, comparing the global evolution of compliance to the weekly percentage changes in new deaths smoothed per million and new cases smoothed per million (Fig. 2). The detrimental effect of non-compliance is evident in this graph. As compliance decreased from almost 75% in July 2020 to less than 30% in October 2020, the week-on-week death rate increased from a low of − 8% in July 2020 to eventually peak at 12% in November 2020.\n\nA similar plot was made using a three-month window to show the evolution of compliance over the 2-year period of varying restrictions from April 2020 to April 2022 (Fig. 3). The plots were made for countries grouped by continent, with global compliance superimposed.\n\nFrom Figs. 2 and 3 we see an obvious downward trend in compliance over time; a clear indicator of restriction fatigue. Figure 2 gives us a sense of how compliance is affected by changes in case and death counts over time, and under the influence of new variants. Figure 3 gives us a longer-term sense of the fatigue trends in the various continents throughout the pandemic, with occasional peaks shortly following a sharp dip in compliance or the emergence of a new variant.\n\nFitting an exponential decay curve to compliance in the pre-vaccination period (April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020), we can estimate the half-life of compliance. Suppose that c(t) is compliance at time t, then exponential decay with a decay constant ɑ is represented as:\n\n$${\\text{c}}\\left( {\\text{t}} \\right) = {\\text{c}}_{0} {\\text{e}}^{{ - \\upalpha {\\text{t}}}}$$\n\n(3)\n\nFitting our compliance time series to the equation, we estimate a decay constant ɑ of 0.004. The half-life is then given by t = − ln(2)/− ɑ. Our estimates found that during the pre-vaccination period, it takes 173 days, a little less than 6 months, for compliance levels to drop to half of the initial value.\n\nFrom Fig. 2 we see that global compliance up until the middle of 2020 was above 65 percent with a 3-month window, showing a high level of willingness from most citizens in the early days to follow the rules imposed to restrict mobility and successfully manage the pandemic. However, towards the end of 2020, we see a sharp decline in compliance. The largest dip in compliance culminates in a less than 30% compliance level seen in early October 2020. This dip in compliance was followed by the emergence of the Delta variant, after which we see a slight rise in compliance followed by another dip in December around the holiday period. The year 2020 ended with a compliance level of 37.45%. This aligns well with the findings of Ganslmeier et al.44, where compliance is shown to be modulated both by weather and social patterns; compliance dips in the typically hotter months and known periods of socialisation.\n\nFrom Fig. 3, it can be seen that compliance was highest in early 2020 and the disparity between different continents was small, demonstrating a concerted effort to contain the virus using mobility restrictions in the absence of vaccines. As the different continents experienced different waves of the pandemic we begin to see clearer temporal differences in compliance levels. For example, after the emergence of the Delta variant, Europe generally had the highest peaks in compliance (greater than 70% in two cases), while Africa’s compliance was generally low (within the range of 0–20% in most cases). By 2022, compliance had dropped so far down in Oceania and North America that compliance levels were actually in the negative based on the Google residential mobility data.\n\nThe observations in the pre-vaccine period throughout 2020 are still the most interesting since these are the responses solely affected by NPIs. During this period, the average compliance levels by continent were, from highest to lowest: 68.17%, 67.22%, 61.35%, 59.37%, 54.25%, and 50.52% for the continents of Europe, Oceania, South America, North America, Asia and Africa respectively. At the country level (Fig. 4) we see a trend of increasing compliance with increasing GDP per capita. The nations of South Korea, Nicaragua, Mongolia, and Tajikistan proved to be outliers with average compliance rates of less than 20% and were thus excluded in subsequent regressions to avoid skewing the global analysis.\n\nMajor differences are expected across nations based on government support mechanisms that allow people to stay at home. In addition, some countries are more likely to have a larger number of people that already work from home, with many engaged in the digital economy. It is therefore not surprising that wealthier countries can afford to have higher compliance levels, potentially explaining why Europe and Oceania are the most compliant continents.\n\nEffectiveness of policy measures\n\nWith the exception of public information campaigns which maintain a high level from April 2020 to the present, the disaggregated stringency measures (Fig. 5) all follow a similar trend, with a spike between March and April 2020 and a slow consistent descent over time. In contrast, policies on facial coverings took off with a much slower start but eventually remained relatively constant around the 70% mark towards the end of the year 2020.\n\nCase numbers generally continued to increase, but the Omicron variant, known to be extremely transmissible, introduced a sharp spike, starting in December 2021 and carried through to April 2022. Fortunately, there was no commensurate spike in the number of deaths in the early part of 2022.\n\nThe impact analysis of the government NPI policies investigated how different responses achieve the desired outcome of lowering cases over different time horizons (Fig. 6). For each policy, the maximum impact and corresponding horizon were identified (Table 3). The aim is to identify policies that reduce cases and therefore have a negative correlation with a large absolute value.\n\nFacial coverings have the greatest impact by successfully driving down the percentage of new COVID-19 case counts with an optimal horizon of 31 days. With the exception of public information campaigns and international travel controls, all the other stringency sub-indices have a positive impact on the percentage change in the number of cases smoothed per million with their optimal horizons in the range of 12–31 days.\n\nInfluence of socioeconomic and demographic factors on compliance\n\nCountry-level socioeconomic and demographic factors were used to investigate the variability in compliance across countries. Compliance was positively correlated with all the considered factors, which intuitively makes sense as an increase in any of the factors should result in better compliance. Note that the corruption index is an inverted feature by definition, and a higher corruption index is indicative of less perceived corruption in a country. The square of the coefficients revealed the following order of feature importance (Fig. 7).\n\nLiteracy Rate is the most highly correlated variable with compliance. This demonstrates that the presence of a highly literate population is a major factor in determining how willing people are to stay at home during lockdowns. Older populations, the ability of a government to provide income support, wealthier populations, and countries with lower corruption, are also more likely to be compliant with restriction measures.\n\nCo-linearity is an obvious problem with the features highlighted in Fig. 7, so after identifying a model with backward stepwise regression, Literacy Rate and the Income Support index were selected as statistically significant features (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 respectively). The model had an adjusted R-squared value of 0.293 (Table 4).\n\nWhile it is clear that income support is effective in driving compliance to stay-at-home requirements, it is also true that many countries do not have the means to implement this. According to a World Bank report45 ninety percent of countries reported a decline in GDP per capita in 2020 and an estimated 120 million people were pushed into extreme poverty. The richer countries of the world would need to help developing economies in order to use income support as a means of improving policy compliance in the face of contagious disease outbreaks.\n\nAn increase of 1% in the literacy rate of a country is associated with a 0.32% increase in compliance (Table 4), meaning that a country with an 80% literacy rate is likely to see 3.2% more compliance than one with a 70% literacy rate. This is in line with Rodon et al.46 who assert that people with a higher COVID-19 health literacy adopt more protective behaviours.\n\nIncome support index, on the other hand, takes on the values 0, 1 or 2 depending, respectively, on whether zero financial support is available, up to half, or greater than half of one’s previously earned income was provided by the government. This regression suggests that providing income support of more than half of previous earnings is associated with an increase of 4.76% in the compliance level (Table 4).\n\nUnivariate linear regressions on the selected features estimate even more gains in compliance for each feature with an estimated 0.41% increase in compliance per unit percentage increase in literacy rate (Fig. 8) and an estimated 8.82% increase in compliance per unit percentage increase in income support (Fig. 9).\n\nEffects of COVID-19 and policy responses on mobility\n\nCompliance was defined as the correlation between the stringency index and residential mobility (time spent in residential locations). The high positive values of compliance found in the first half of 2020, averaging over a three-month window (Fig. 2), is proof that people are generally compliant with COVID-19 policies, but fatigue tends to set in once the number of deaths begins to decline (Fig. 2). In the first half of 2020, global citizens maintained a compliance level higher than 65% on average. Towards the end of the first year of the pandemic, however, there was a significant drop in compliance across the entire globe, which is evidence of further fatigue. Vaccinations have not solved the problem of increasing COVID-19 case counts, but have been strongly associated with the falling mortality rate47,48. Lower mortality rates offer people the confidence to resume life as normal, making vaccines a likely motivator for people’s return to a semblance of normalcy. Nevertheless, vaccines are not the only plausible reason for further drops in compliance after 2020.\n\nEconomies are sustained by the working population, and eventually, countries had to reopen workplaces to keep their economies afloat. The effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing mobility was studied by regressing compliance on country-level variables. Literacy Rate was the most highly correlated variable that explained when the citizens of a country were able to maintain a high level of compliance. It can be inferred that with a high COVID-19 health literacy rate in a population, people tend to adopt better protective measures. The second most significant variable is the income support index. To ensure that citizens have enough resources to stay at home, income support is clearly a recommended mechanism, since citizens are more likely to comply with stay-at-home directives if they have an alternative means of making ends meet. Median age and the log of GDP per capita are also well-featured values, supporting the assertions that older populations are more compliant due to their vulnerability49, and that countries need to have adequate wealth in order to offer resources to sustain workers and families at home.\n\nEffectiveness of policy measures\n\nIt currently takes at least a year to fully develop and test a vaccine to meet international standards50. As such, in the event of any new pandemic, policies implemented in the pre-vaccination period are critical for suppressing the spread of infections. Determining how citizens respond to different policies until a more permanent solution can be developed and applied at a national or global scale is therefore of great importance.\n\nThere are two major considerations for such policies: the first is the effectiveness of the policy in controlling the spread of the disease, and the second is the effect of the policy on the livelihoods of people. Any extended negative impact on the livelihoods of people will weaken the effectiveness of a policy due to fatigue and eventually a lack of compliance.\n\nOur study using information about the stringency of a particular policy and the number of cases for each day and country allowed for the quantification of the impact over different temporal horizons. It provided a comparison of the impact of various policies and the horizon over which they take maximum effect. It is evident that most policies require well over 20 days to yield any effect, and that the impact is marginal for some of these policies. It is also worth noting that it takes at least 12 days for any single policy to effectively contribute to a decline in case counts as seen in the case of Gathering Restrictions and Closure of Public Transport (Fig. 6).\n\nFacial coverings have the highest impact at 8.8% and play an important role in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases within a period of approximately one month, while also being the most cost-effective method, as confirmed by Mitze et al.19. Gathering restrictions are the most useful for achieving a short-term impact of 5.9%. Workplace Closures, Cancellation of Public Events, Stay Home Requirements, School Closures and Internal Movement Restrictions all operate over a horizon of around 25 days and had decreasing impacts of 4.5%, 3.4%, 3.1%, 2.1% and 1.9% respectively. Closure of Public Transport was also short-term at 12 days but delivered a small impact of 1.0%. Both public information campaigns and international travel controls are found to deliver negligible impact and are therefore difficult to justify based on the global evidence from this study. It is therefore recommended that facial coverings are introduced immediately when a new airborne pandemic emerges as this is both an effective and relatively cheap policy with no adverse effects on mobility or economic growth. School closures had a relatively small impact of 2.1% and it is recommended to focus on the most impactful policies before resorting to this restriction which can have serious long-term effects on the education of children. For example, school closures in Uganda lasted for 82 weeks45 adversely affecting many students. The minor impact of school closures was previously echoed in the findings of the heavily cited study by Viner et al. 51 which concluded that “school closures alone would prevent only 2–4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions”.\n\nInfluence of socioeconomic and demographic factors on compliance\n\nThe greatest influence on compliance is the literacy rate, followed by income support. Both variables are selected in backward stepwise regression at a significance level of p < 0.05 (p < 0.001 for literacy rate), with an adjusted R-squared value of 29.3%. This finding suggests that these variables are statistically significant in explaining the compliant behaviour of those citizens that stayed at home under tight stringency measures.\n\nA cross-validation evaluation was used to test for overfitting and establish the robustness of the results. The objective here is to train and test on different samples, thereby ensuring that the evaluation is fully out-of-sample. This was achieved using leave-one-out cross-validation, whereby one country is left out in each regression fold. This approach yielded a cross-validated R-squared value of 26.2%. As this value is close to our initial adjusted R-squared value of 29.3% we can safely conclude that overfitting is not an issue and therefore confirm a high level of confidence in our analyses.\n\nIn this paper we have empirically analysed the effects of COVID-19 case counts and deaths on mobility. We observed how increased numbers of deaths increased the mortality ratio in the pre-vaccination period leading to lockdowns and other high stringency measures, causing people to stay at home in line with policies. We also observed the effects of policy fatigue as compliance waned with every reduction in the number of deaths.\n\nWith the variants of concern observed in this paper, we see a trend where a new variant leads to a spike either in deaths or in cases (the former being more seriously impactful). With this increase comes more reactive stringency measures from governments, leading to compliance for as long as the wave lasts. By the end of each wave, measures are relaxed and life returns to some semblance of normalcy. With each new variant, however, people appear to have become less risk-averse, especially with the downward trends of the mortality ratio and the successful administration of vaccinations. Effectively, based on a multiplicity of factors, compliance has reduced despite the emergence of new variants.\n\nWe came to the conclusion, in line with existing research17,18, that face coverings are the most effective intervention as well as the most cost-effective, associated with the highest reductions by percentage in the number of COVID-19 cases after approximately a month.\n\nRecommendations\n\nBased on the relative efficacy of masks, we recommend the mandatory use of face masks as the best first step in the pre-vaccination stage of any airborne disease. Gathering restrictions are also advisable in the short term, achieving maximum impact over a short period of just 12 days. Workplace closures, cancellation of public events and stay home requirements are also advisable in countries with a large digital economy. Where there is the ability to work remotely and organize events online without having to leave home, there is an opportunity to curb the effects of the pandemic without delivering a crippling shock to the economy. In countries with low levels of digitization and poor internet penetration, the options may be limited and it is necessary to carefully balance public health with economic considerations. There already exists evidence that COVID-19 has increased global income inequality, partly undoing two decades of progress in lowering inequality and disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups and Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), where income inequality is considerably higher than in advanced economies52.\n\nWe do not advise school closures except as a last resort because of the terrible implications for students and their future53, with further evidence in the case of Uganda45, and the particularly harsh effects school closure has on girl-child education54. Restrictions on internal motion and public transport are likely to have an effect on the economy because of how critical mobility is to business. Public information campaigns have been so consistent since the start of the pandemic that they no longer offer any explainability. International travel restrictions are only useful in the very early days of a pandemic, but our analysis suggests that once cases are recorded internally in several countries, they become unnecessary as a mitigation measure.\n\nPolicies for managing a pandemic are only as effective as the citizens are cooperative, meaning that governments should put measures in place to keep fatigue at a minimum and avoid risking the livelihoods of citizens for extended periods of time. Income support and GDP per capita are strong indicators of likely compliance. Essentially, the financial standing of a nation explains its ability to keep citizens comfortable enough to abide with restrictions. If income support is not an option based on available finances, lockdowns will likely fail, and it is more advisable for poorer nations to enforce the use of masks and implement other social distancing measures.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe data available only permitted us to calculate compliance based on mobility. While we know what policies are being rolled out by governments we have no way of knowing how people comply with non-mobility related policies, like the wearing of face coverings.\n\nAnother limitation was accurate information about variants. The information on emergence of variants often lacked temporal accuracy due to few countries having the required technical capacity to detect variants. This implies that reasonable assumptions have to be made about when variants were actually first discovered. There is also a lack of information on the percentages of variants circulating at any point in time, forcing us to disregard the possibility that certain previous variants might still be circulating with significant impact.\n\nWe also encountered a lack of data on the monetary valuation of policy implementation costs. A lot of the existing analysis focuses on the social and wellness costs of policies. Unfortunately, without any explicit financial data on the spend for policy implementations, there is no practical way of undertaking an extensive cost–benefit analysis across the globe to understand which policies make the most financial sense, and what the actual monetary cost is when implementing such a policy.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14088-7', 'Headline': 'A cross-country comparison of Covid-19 containment measures and their ...', 'Snippet': 'Background European countries are still searching to eliminate or contain the Covid-19 pandemic.

In fact, the progress of modern medicine has allowed the development in record time of effective and safe vaccines to prevent Covid-19 symptomatic infection, severe disease, admissions to hospital, and deaths [2,3,4]. Unfortunately, it has not been possible yet to ensure equitable access to vaccination throughout the world because there is not adequate availability of vaccines. Thus, it is essential to maintain non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent transmission and reduce infections (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines). Actually, around the world, countries are still seeking to limit the impact of Covid-19 on health and society after more than 2 years of fighting SARS-CoV-2. To do this, governments are working as fast and fairly as possible to avoid new waves of the pandemic, minimize lives lost and maximize health, economic and social outcomes. Now, in 2022, we are more capable to identify new outbreaks early through timely and constant monitoring, to take appropriate measures to control the spreading of the virus (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/governments-approach-to-managing-local-coronavirus-outbreaks). We have a tool to control the virus, but large parts of the population for various reasons refuse to accept it. Countries have put in place legislative plans to address this issue. The concept, previously unknown, of a Covid Certificate has been introduced, in its various denominations and with the various peculiarities in different nations or geographical areas, showing also in this field differences at the international level [5].\n\nDespite the availability of a winning tool - vaccines - due to the problems mentioned above, non-pharmaceutical interventions remain essential. They must be combined with a very accurate contact tracing and mass vaccination campaigns to be extended to as many countries as possible.\n\nThrough our research, we seek to understand how different mitigation and containment strategies have been important in the past, focusing specifically on the investigation of the early stages of the pandemic, so that we can emphasize how key they are today and for the future at minimizing the risk of potential additional waves of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [6] in containing and mitigating contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus was assessed in this study [7]. Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of the containment measures adopted in order to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nNon-pharmaceutical public health measures and their effects on person-to-person transmission at the individual level (physical distancing, use of face masks, wearing of eye protection) have been studied by the Covid-19 Systematic Urgent Review Group Effort (SURGE). The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of one meter or more and highlight the importance of the use of masks, respirators and eye protection in order to avoid or minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants [8].\n\nStay-at-home orders, curfews and lockdown measures commonly occurred in countries with more than 10% daily increases in new cases [9] and the enforcement of strict physical distancing, along with robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine, contributed to keeping the disease at a level that did not exceed the capacity of a country’s health care system [10].\n\nHowever, policy responses to Covid-19 seem to remain complex, context-specific and are rapidly evolving as different countries pursue varying approaches to manage the pandemic. Analyzing these policies can help to understand and assess government preparedness, timing of reactions and resilience (https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker), [11].\n\nConsiderable efforts have gone into tracking health systems’ or governments’ responses to the pandemic, e.g., as part of the Covid-19 Health Systems Response Monitor. For example, Li et al. and Flaxman et al. conducted interesting comparisons of the approaches adopted by different countries in dealing with the pandemic [12]. In addition, previous research has shown that countries with less stringent lockdown measures have seen more pronounced surges (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).\n\nThis research aims to describe evidence on the effect of containment measures throughout the course of the pandemic in five European countries so far. “Containment measures” refer to the non-pharmaceutical and restrictive interventions. More specifically, the paper’s objectives included: 1) to compare the strength of containment measures adopted in the included countries; 2) to assess the timing of the introduction and relaxation of containment measures in relationship to the changes in the number of cases in these countries; and 3) to speculate about the effect the timing of relaxation measures had on the future course of the pandemic.\n\nWe chose France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom for our analysis because they were the first European countries to be hit by the pandemic (by end of February 2020, according to John Hopkins University information (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The results of this study may help decision makers better understand the effects of containment measures and the potential implications of lifting these measures too early. In fact, after studying the examples provided by the five countries and making statistical forecasts, we intend to provide a model that can help policy makers in making their important choices to address the current new waves of the pandemic and variants of the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThe approach adopted by this study consisted of three steps. First, we built a “Containment Index” (C.I.) which considers nine parameters selected in order to make assessments on the strength of restrictive measures adopted by the five included countries. Second, dynamic epidemiological models were developed for forecasting purposes. Third, predicted case numbers, assuming containment measures remain constant, were compared to observed numbers for a period of 30 days following the relaxation of containment measures in each country.\n\nMeasuring intervention with the containment index\n\nIn order to measure government reactions to the pandemic, we followed a similar approach as the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [13], but focused on containment measures only and tailored it to the countries in scope for our analysis (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK).\n\nWe identified a set of nine parameters C1, C2 ...C9 (only partially overlapping with OxCGRT), as described in Table 1, then scored and summarized them into a single summary index called “Containment Index” (C.I.).\n\nWeb research was conducted to collect the following information on governments’ responses in the five selected European countries: details of the actions they took, the start and end dates of those actions. Various bibliographic sources and reference sites were consulted for all countries analyzed in the study (https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-which-countries-are-under-lockdown-and-who-s-next), (https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse) to collect information on the restrictive measures respectively adopted in France (https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19), (https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/France-deconfinement-May-11-What-is-allowed-or-not-allowed-parks-beaches-schools-bars-restaurants-going-out-travel-transport), (https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11391728/coronavirus-france-lockdown/), (https://www.france24.com/en/20200622-back-to-school-for-millions-in-france-as-more-covid-19-restrictions-lifted), (https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/05/26/scho-m26.html), (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52615733), Germany (https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en), (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51999080), (https://kcrwberlin.com/2020/06/covid-19-in-berlin-and-germany-what-you-need-to-know/), (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Germany), (https://berlinspectator.com/2020/06/01/chronology-germany-and-the-coronavirus-3/), (https://www.euractiv.com/section/coronavirus/news/germany-extends-covid19-restrictions-but-announces-relaxation-of-some-measures/), (https://www.bavaria.by/information-coronavirus/), (https://www.thelocal.de/20200518/state-by-state-what-are-the-new-rules-for-eating-out-around-germany), (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/germans-urged-to-stay-home-amid-covid-19-infection-rate-fears), (https://www.dw.com/en/what-are-germanys-new-coronavirus-social-distancing-rules/a-52881742), Italy (http://www.governo.it/it/coronavirus-misure-del-governo), Spain (https://www.spainenglish.com/2020/05/31/lifting-lockdown-spain-full-details-phases/), (https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20200605/mapa-desescalada-espana-fase-esta-tu-provincia/2013477.shtml), (https://www.boe.es/biblioteca_juridica/codigos/codigo.php?id=363&modo=2&nota=0&tab=2) and in the UK (https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy), (https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/coronavirus-and-devolution), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools), (supplementary material S0).\n\nFor each parameter, responses have been scored according to the below schema (Table 2). Scores are scaled to the same range from 0 (no restrictions) to 1 (max containment) in order to make them comparable. For some measures it was not possible to define an intermediate grading and we described it in the table as ‘not assigned’.\n\nWe tracked the start and end dates for each progressive restriction and then, for the data analyses and representation, the temporal axis was converted from days to weeks (Mon. - Sun.), following the rule that, for a given parameter, a week is assigned the score that is valid for the most (≥ 4) days in the week. In our analyses we tracked and analyzed data from the week starting on February 24th, 2020, to the week starting June 1st, 2020.\n\nFinally, for each country/week, an overall Containment Index (C.I.) score was assigned. This is defined as the sum of the scores for the nine metrics, reflecting our assumption that each parameter evenly contributes to the overall index.\n\nModeling Covid-19 infection\n\nWe developed a Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator which allows for daily predictions of “total active cases” based on the level and trajectory of active cases by country, region or state (public data from national and regional health commissions for the five countries analyzed: France [14, 15], Germany [16], Italy (https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19), Spain [17, 18] and the UK [19, 20], (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/#category=nations&map=rate).\n\nThe Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator fits an upgraded version of the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) compartmental models to allow for parameter customization by country, region or state and introduces dynamic contact rates to better predict the peak time and general trend. SEIR [21,22,23,24,25,26] is a well-known class of models that is widely used for modeling epidemic evolution and generating related predictions. The SEIR model, its general parameters and the other parameters introduced to adjust the model to better fit different nations or regions are explained in detail in in supplementary materials (Supplementary material S1).\n\nThe input to the models were confirmed Covid-19 cases (per PCR testing) that have been progressively made available by national/regional health commissions [10, 27], (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-).\n\nIn some cases, public data have been amended and/or integrated after. This is not reflected in our analyses. In case of missing reported total cases for a few specific days, linear interpolation was applied.\n\nComparing the containment index across countries\n\nGiven the lack of an internationally accepted definition of terms, such as “lockdown” or “Phase Two”, we decided to define key milestones (and consequently phases) based on the evolution of the Containment Index over time to facilitate comparability across countries:\n\nTargeted period starts when the Containment Index becomes greater than 0 and if the first government measures are targeted to specific areas, regions or subsets of the population (called T0).\n\nLockdown starts when the Containment Index becomes greater than 7 (the countries during lockdown can reach the maximum value of Containment Index, which is 9) (called T1).\n\nPhase Two starts when, after the peak, the Containment Index becomes lower again or equal to 6 (called T2).\n\nSubsequently, analyses focused on comparing countries on a like-for-like basis, somewhat ignoring calendar time. Comparisons have been carried out in terms of descriptive analyses of the collected information (total cases and containment measures) as well as leveraging the predictions generated by the SEIR models implemented.\n\nFor each country, the Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator has provided daily forecasts for total cases up to a maximum of + 150 days. For example, on March 1st, the Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator generated predictions for total cases for March 2nd (+ 1 day) up to July 28th (+ 150 days) leveraging observed total cases up to March 1st; on March 2nd it generated predictions for March 3rd (+ 1 day) up to July 29th (+ 150 days) leveraging observed total cases up to March 2nd and so on. Day-after-day models progressively learn by incremental information made available which is reflected in more accurate predictions.\n\nIn the initial phase of the pandemic, one of the interesting objectives was to predict time to peak. But, as time passed, forecasts generated in previous months had been progressively overridden by actual data. Now, looking backward, we can leverage predictions made at specific points in time, compare different trajectories and correlate them to the different underlying restriction policies. In particular, based on predictions taken at Phase Two’s start (T2), we might speculate on what, under modelling assumptions, might have happened if lockdown restrictions continued for a longer time.\n\nFor such an exercise, we decided to focus on predictions at + 30 days. On one hand, we know that the accuracy of long-term predictions rapidly decreases given the extremely complex, fast-evolving factors that affect pandemic evolution (government restrictions as well as population compliance, mobility, individual behavior, social organization, climate, etc.). On the other hand, it is important to consider that potential effects of a containment measure might need approximately 14 days, according to the average duration for incubation based on clinical evidence and the recent studies confirming there is a lag for impacts of measures to be visible [28]. So, we need a forecast window reasonably greater than 2 weeks. Balancing the two considerations we chose a maximum timeframe of + 30 days.\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK applied restrictive measures to contain the pandemic, but the timing and effect on the national curves of the Covid-19 cases varied. The graphical representation of these results is available in supplementary materials (Supplementary material S2).\n\nInitial reactions\n\nItaly was the first western country to face the pandemic; the country had to react quickly and did not give up. During the week beginning on February 24th, some restrictive measures were applied only at a local level with a Containment Index of 4.5 (all confined locally to the so-called “red areas”). One week later, these measures were intensified and some of them were extended to the national level, while other restrictions were only adopted locally.\n\nIn Germany, the period of restricted measures that were partially applied at the regional level lasted for 4 weeks, twice as long as in Italy. It began, as in Italy, on February 24th, but in a very mild way, through the partial closure of schools and moreover only at a local level (C.I. = 0.25).\n\nIn Spain, the targeted local measures lasted only 1 week, starting on March 9th and concerned the partial local closure of some schools (C1 = 0.5).\n\nIn France, targeted restrictive measures were applied only on the first parameter: partial and local closure of schools from March 2nd to March 15th (C1 = 0.5).\n\nThe United Kingdom has having a particular attitude in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. Initially, they decided not to adopt any restrictive measures and recently as early as January 27, 2022 have lifted the requirement for masks and green passes. “In England, face coverings are no longer required by law. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet” (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own).\n\nCountry lockdowns\n\nOn March 9th, Italy was the first European country to enter a national lockdown and it lasted for 10 weeks, until May 3rd, with a C.I. = 9 and for the next 2 weeks until May 17th with a C.I. = 6.75.\n\nFrom March 16th to May 10th, France was in lockdown for 8 weeks (C.I. = 9).\n\nOn March 16th, also Spain entered lockdown for 9 weeks. We observed C.I. = 9 only for 3 weeks (from March 30th to April 19th), after which it progressively decreased. Starting on May 11th, the last week of lockdown, closures were regional for all the analyzed parameters, leading to an overall C.I. = 7.\n\nIn Germany, during the lockdown that started on March 23rd, the value of the C.I. varied from 7.25 in the first 4 weeks to 6.75 in the two remaining weeks of the entire period (6 weeks).\n\nOn the same day as Germany, the UK government decided to enter a national lockdown that lasted 10 weeks (one of the longest lockdowns among the countries analyzed). During the first 7 weeks, C.I. = 9 and then, from May 11th to May 31st, C.I. = 7.75\n\nEntering phase two\n\nThe first country to enter the Phase Two was Germany: beginning on May 4th, shops with less than 800 square meters and limited in-person shops could re-open, but with restrictions. From May 4th to May 18th, the C.I. was equal to 3.5. nationally then C.I. decreased to 3.25 on May 25th.\n\nAfter entering Phase Two on May 11th, France maintained an overall C.I. = 5 for the remaining duration of the analyzed period. It was possible to move within a maximum distance of 100 km and schools gradually reopened at the beginning of Phase Two but with some restrictions: e.g., middle schools remained closed in red zones and gradually reopened in departments only in green zones.\n\nOn May 18th, Phase Two began in Italy at the national level: the C.I. achieved during the first 2 weeks of this phase was 3.25 (schools continue to be closed and there was no longer the stay-at-home requirement). During the week beginning on June 1st, the C.I. lowered to 2.5 due to no more restrictions on domestic movement.\n\nOn the same day as in Italy, Spain entered Phase Two and the restrictive measures were relaxed at the regional level with a C.I. = 5.25. From May 25th to the end of our analysis period, Spain achieved a C.I. = 4.\n\nOn June 1st in the UK, there was a gradual relaxation of the restrictive measures and the country entered Phase Two, but the level of attention and alertness was kept high, as reflected by a C.I. = 6, with a partial opening of schools and restrictions on gatherings\n\nPredictions about lockdown end and phase two start: (T2) + 30 days\n\nThe predictions made with our forecasting model focused especially on Lockdown end and Phase Two start. T2 + 30 would have been June 3rd in Germany, June 10th in France, June 17th in Italy and Spain and July 1stin the UK.\n\nIn Fig. 2, we analyzed the total number of reported positive cases per 100,000 of population in the five countries (https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker), (https://www.spainenglish.com/2020/05/31/lifting-lockdown-spain-full-details-phases/), (https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20200605/mapa-desescalada-espana-fase-esta-tu-provincia/2013477.shtml), (https://www.boe.es/biblioteca_juridica/codigos/codigo.php?id=363&modo=2&nota=0&tab=2), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy), (https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/coronavirus-and-devolution), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools), [14,15,16, 27].\n\nConsidering the duration of the restrictive measures in the lockdown phase of the pandemic, Germany adopted the longest local (targeted) restrictive measures (4 weeks) and the shortest lockdown (6 weeks), which started later (when there were 35 cases per 100 K) compared to the other countries. Almost all the selected countries adopted restrictive measures for a period of 10 weeks while in Italy they took a period of 12 weeks (10 of which as lockdown). All the selected countries implemented a gradual closure of services and a progressive limitation of individual freedom except for the UK, since they didn’t adopt targeted measures.\n\nIn Fig. 3, we plotted the actual cases curve (continuous line) against predictions taken at T2 (dotted line) for each country (i.e., assuming lockdown containment measures were not eased). For instance, in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, predictions under the assumption of additional lockdown weeks would have led to significantly lower cases (− 4.9, − 3.3%, − 2.4%, and − 5.9%, respectively at T2 + 30 days). However, for Italy, the real cases curve is very close to the predicted cases (+ 0.5% at T2 + 30 days), indicating that, had they maintained restrictions, they would not have changed the evolution on the curve.\n\nIn addition, in Fig. 4 we have compared actual against predictions taken at T2 focusing on average new daily cases in the following 30 days. Here we can see that, according to predictions from our model, all countries except Italy might have benefited from a prolonged lockdown.\n\nTo face the Covid-19 pandemic, most European countries, and in particular those analyzed in this study (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK), have adopted diverse non-pharmaceutical and restrictive interventions ranging from case quarantine and isolation of contacts to the lockdown of entire populations. Assessing the impact of lockdowns and identifying the optimal strategies to manage the health crisis beyond lockdowns is of critical importance. To avoid the healthcare facilities overload, the severity of clinical cases and many deaths, it is has proved necessary to plan the response, adopting measures such as case finding, contact tracing, isolations and lockdowns of nations [29] and in parallel the large-scale vaccination campaign. Although these restrictive measures are crucial in minimizing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, the risk of pandemic resurgence when restrictions are relaxed and societies go back to a “business as usual” lifestyle has remained high. It is important to find a compromise between public health requirement and the economic and social needs of the population, analyzing the different restrictive measures in order to improve these measures aimed at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [10].\n\nThe Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) constantly collects information on measures taken by different governments to contain the effects of the pandemic and now has data from more than 180 countries. Surely this is an important tool for worldwide comparisons but, in our study, we thought it would be helpful to understand these comparisons across a limited number of European countries. As a result, we went for a tailored definition of all parameters for Containment Index definition.\n\nOther studies have addressed the topic of quantifying the effect of containment actions by looking at a rather high number of countries: Talic S et al. performed a meta-analysis to research the effect of handwashing, mask wearing and physical distancing measures on incidence of Covid-19. They concluded that these several personal and social protective measures are associated with decrease in virus circulation [30].\n\nIezadi S et al. in their meta-analysis showed that NPIs has determined a decrease in the COVID-19 reproduction number, daily case growth rates, daily death growth rates and COVID-19 daily ICU admission. It emerged that early enaction of lockdown, which predates the explosion in the number of positive cases, has been followed by a shorter duration of the lockdown itself and a smaller increase in the rate of case growth in the period after the application of this maximum containment measure [31].\n\nLi et al. conducted a modelling study across 131 countries [28] and Flaxman et al. studied the effect of major interventions across 11 European countries [12]. Conversely, our analyses aimed to describe, in a comparative way, different containment approaches implemented by the five countries and to qualitatively correlate them with the evolution of the pandemic. Our analyses were aimed at assessing whether mild measures or delays in adopting the different types of restrictive measures could have influenced the number of Covid-19 cases and the evolution of the epidemic curve, in order to be able to guide the near-future choices of governments, policy makers and health authorities in the best possible way. Consequently, based on the evolution of case numbers and the adopted restrictive measures in Europe, it is possible to make the following considerations.\n\nFollowing the diagnosis of the first patient affected by Covid-19 in Germany on January 27th, Germany implemented much milder and shorter restrictive measures in comparison to the other four countries. All restrictions were applied to every German state and were kept in place for a total of 6 weeks but there was never a total closure and, unlike the other European countries, Germany never issued a curfew. It should be noted that during the lockdown Germany never adopted the stay-at-home requirements in an absolute way (C8 = 0.5). Germany would have had a reduction of new cases from an extension of the lockdown and likely from the application of more restrictive measures as well, given the trend of the T2 + 30 curve in our predictive model (− 3.3%).\n\nAs early as January 30th, the Italian government ordered the blocking of air traffic from China, the first European government to do so. This was the beginning of the application of a long list of restrictive measures in Italy. After the first 2 weeks of targeted measures, Italy adopted one of the longest periods of lockdown (10 weeks, like in the UK) compared to the other selected countries. The adoption of such stringent measures has made a unique and indispensable contribution to the ongoing fight against the pandemic. In fact, as we observed in our predictive model, it seems that the relaxation of the restrictive measures was introduced at the right time because there would have been no net reduction of daily cases if the country would have entered Phase Two later (T2 + 30 = 0,5%). This shows a big difference between Italy and the other four countries analyzed in our study regarding the entry of the countries to Phase Two.\n\nAs France experienced the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a nationwide lockdown was implemented to curb the dramatic increase in the number of patients in critical conditions. The country is the only one to have maintained a total closure for all parameters (C.I. = 9) during the entire lockdown. However, this seems not to have been enough. In fact, considering our predictive model, France could have benefited from an extension of the lockdown duration, being able to obtain a further reduction in the number of new cases (T2 + 30 = − 4,9%).\n\nFollowing the story of Italy, Germany and France, Spain adopted a long lockdown (9 weeks) but maintained the maximum level of restriction for the shortest time (the maximum C.I. = 9 was true for only 3 weeks, compared to Germany where the maximum C.I. = 7.25 was held for 4 weeks). Spain is also the only country to have applied all restrictive measures at the targeted level before Phase Two (i.e., during the lockdown). Both these attitudes could justify the trend of the T2 + 30 curve of our preventive model (− 2,4%). The country probably should have applied more stringent restrictive measures and should have delayed the application of restrictive measures at the regional level, considering that Spain is the country that entered Phase Two with the highest number of cases per 100 K population (496 total cases per 100 K population) among the five countries analyzed.\n\nThe UK, despite not having gone through a targeted period, has applied very stringent restrictive measures during the lockdown and the country has very gradually entered Phase Two. The UK lockdown lasted for the same duration as the Italian lockdown, but the country started to adopt the first restrictive measures 4 weeks later than Italy did (March 23rd in the UK compared to February 24th in Italy). In our preventive model, the country would have benefited greatly (− 5.9%) from a delayed entry into Phase Two. This can be justified, as in France, by a consistent circulation of the virus that was difficult to control, already existing at the beginning of the adoption of the restrictive measures in the country. The UK has decided not to take some measures on a regional basis, as has been done by France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThe easing of the measures was carried out in a more or less gradual and cautious way by all five countries: for Phase Two, Germany had reported the lowest number of total cases per 100 K population among the five countries of the study, followed by France, Italy, the UK, and finally Spain (which loosened with the majority of cases). We can say that, compared to the other four countries analyzed, Germany was the first country to adopt a relaxation of restrictive measures: Germany began its first steps to ease restrictions on April 20th (during lockdown). Schools were reopened in Germany (C1 = 0.75), and approximately 25% of the students were allowed to go to school. Schools were soon opened in France (on May 11th) but there was a maximum number of 15 students for each classroom (C1 = 0.5). During Phase Two in Spain and Italy, schools continued to be closed. Particular attention should be paid to the fact that when Germany entered Phase Two, it had not imposed any restrictions on internal movement of citizens. Further, Italy was the only country that renounced the stay-at-home requirements immediately when it entered the Phase Two.\n\nConsistent evidence can be observed in our study and in others previously published on the impact of restrictions’ ease. In particular, our findings on restrictive measures’ effects are in line with the findings from Flaxman and colleagues [12] who assessed the impact of different NPIs among 11 European countries, but not their effects. Flaxman and colleagues reported clearly that several NPIs (e.g., school closure and public events ban) combined with lockdown had a large effect (81%) on reducing transmission. Our findings are also consistent with results from a 131 cross-country study by Li and colleagues [28]. They observed that individual NPIs are associated with a reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission and that the effect of introducing and lifting NPIs is delayed by 1–3 weeks, with a longer delay occurring when NPIs are lifted: a resurgence in Covid-19 cases has been reported in some countries that lifted some of these NPIs.\n\nBased on our observations, France and the UK had a small number of positive cases at the beginning of the pandemic and during lockdown, while Spain experienced high caseloads during the first wave of the pandemic and a constant increase of positive cases for SARS-CoV-2 during the second phase.\n\nFurther, looking at the evolution of the epidemic curves in the different countries, if we assume that lockdown containment measures were not eased (i.e., predictions until T2 + 30, the dotted line in the Fig. 3), we obtain interesting information when comparing countries. If the total blocking measures were prolonged, they would have led to a greater reduction of cases in the UK (− 5.9%), France (− 4.9%), Germany (− 3.3%) and Spain (− 2.4%), while Italy (+ 0.5%) would not have achieved substantial improvements (the zeroing target had already been achieved).\n\nWhen speculating about possible reasons for the different effects in easing lockdown measures, we mainly observed different behaviors related to school measures. Schools remained closed in Phase Two in Italy and in Spain while the other three countries gradually reopened (C1 was 0.75 at the beginning of Phase Two in France, in Germany and in the UK). In Germany, only the last year of each school level restarted (approximately 25% of students). In France, kindergarten and primary school children returned to school on a voluntary basis, middle schools were gradually reopened in the green zones while they remained closed in red zones. Like France, the UK began easing restrictions on schools starting with the opening of kindergarten and primary school.\n\nAs for other parameters such as businesses and workplaces, shops and retail, hospitality, personal care activities, assembly and leisure, internal movement, stay at home and gatherings, only Italy adopted targeted restrictions before the lockdown and Germany only had partially adopted restrictions for shops and retail, hospitality, assembly and leisure, and gatherings. In Italy, the early partial - and then total - restrictions concerning all the mentioned parameters can justify the good result reached by the predictive model T2 + 30. Furthermore, based on the number of Covid-19 cases, Germany was the first to introduce targeted measures (at 0.02 total cases per 100 K population) and Spain the last one (at 4,94 total cases per 100 K population). The UK entered lockdown with the same number of cases as France (10 total cases per 100 K population), but the UK started applying the restrictive measures a week later than France and without previous targeted measures reporting a number of Covid-19 cases almost double than France at the beginning of Phase Two (407 cases per 100 K in the UK vs. 214 cases per 100 K in France).\n\nThe results of our model speculate the evolution of the pandemic curve if the containment measures were prolonged and suggest that all the countries except Italy would have benefited from longer restrictions at the time of Phase One, although it was not possible to clearly quantify the contribution different behaviors had. Overall, we can say that there were three main factors that affected the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the above mentioned European countries: 1) the time when containment measures were adopted according to the epidemic curve (the earlier were the better); 2) the duration of containment measure adoption (2 weeks of early restrictive measures before the lockdown gave better results than no restrictive measures before the lockdown); 3) the number of Covid-19 cases before easing containment measures (the fewer the better before concluding the lockdown). We agree with Iezadi S et al. that the NPIs has had successful impacts on containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, despite the substantial impacts on economies and mental health. In addition to addressing issues regarding universal access to vaccines, considering the severe consequences of national lockdown and other restrictions, these interventions should be accompanied or mitigated by the adoption of other NPIs such as contact tracing, the use of face masks and suspected/patient case isolation strategies [31].\n\nGovernmental policies were found to play a crucial role in delaying the Covid-19 infection early spread [32] and the Case fatality rate, CFR [33]. From a detailed analysis regarding the introduction of some restrictive measures (nine analyzed parameters) in the five countries of our study (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK) and their subsequent lifting, their importance for the mitigation of the Covid-19 pandemic has emerged. In fact, the UK began to tackle SARS-CoV-2 with restrictive measures later than others and, despite having applied these measures for a long time, had greater difficulty in the fight against the virus. On the other hand, Italy, the first European country to be hit and to promptly implement the restrictive measures on all nine parameters analyzed, would not have benefited from a possible extension of the lockdown. In Germany, the restrictive measures were applied promptly but in a much milder way than in the other four countries; despite having the lowest number of cases (per 100 k population) when Phase Two started, the country would have possibly benefited from prolonged restrictive measures. France began rather promptly to adopt the restrictive measures against SARS-CoV-2 but the lockdown lasted only 8 weeks and the country would have benefited from a delayed entry into Phase Two. Spain applied restrictions limited to some regions during the lockdown. It was the country that entered Phase Two with the largest number of cases.\n\nReintroducing or easing restrictions are undoubtedly important decisions for governments because they have a relevant impact on the economy as well as on the psychological integrity and health of the population. For this reason, such decisions should be made by weighing many factors, including the epidemiological situation of the country, the capacity and resilience of the health system and the attitude and habits of the population. Our findings provide additional evidence that can inform policy makers’ decisions on introducing and relaxing of the different containment measures and their timing. Given the features of the Covid-19 pandemic, extensive case findings and isolations would be required to progressively lower the intensity of interventions and allow for the partial release of the socio-economic pressure and avoid the healthcare system exceeding saturation. We can only end the pandemic in one place by ending the pandemic everywhere. The entire world has the same goal: decrease Covid-19 cases. The SARS-CoV-2 countries’ response was very different: in some cases it was a failure, in others a success. Surely the most important lesson learned is that we can definitely defeat the invisible enemy and its emerging variants by improving our knowledge about the virus, its effects and how to contain both.\n\nLimitation of the study\n\nOverall, we acknowledge challenges and limitations regarding our analyses and interpretation of Covid-19 dynamics. First of all, in the initial phase of the pandemic, overall detection and reporting of positive cases was less accurate than in the following periods, causing models to learn from a likely underestimated total cases curve [34, 35]. Second, at the beginning, the number of tests (swabs) was insufficient, so a great majority of asymptomatic subjects were not tested. Third, we are aware that there might be gaps in the data used, in some specific days or due to country-specific reporting systems. In case of missing information, we replaced it with linear interpolation between adjacent observations. Fourth, as for the different containment actions, our scoring system considers the start and end dates as well as the level of restriction declared by each country according to our investigation. The level of compliance from population is not considered as it was not possible to properly measure it.\n\nWe acknowledge also limitations of the SEIR method used in our analysis: the removed subjects (R) are the recovered and dead cases that are assumed to be immune to the disease and would not be reintroduced to the susceptible (S). Model performances (and predictions generated) highly depend on accuracy, transparency, and promptness of data used as inputs. Related to this, in some cases, countries implemented changes in the reporting and testing approach, which would potentially affect the reported dynamics for case evolution. As for the model, as expected, accuracy of predictions decreases along time and models implemented in the Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator maximize short term (7-day) predictions. Also, it is important to underline that predictions at each step for each country are generated by the models under the assumptions that conditions are not varying. In our speculations, we have considered “what if” lockdown measure continued for some weeks more, but predictions cannot take into account additional external factors such as changes in populations’ behaviors (self-reducing contacts, limiting social activities, increased hygiene/disinfection in everyday life).'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/', 'Headline': ""What is China's zero-COVID policy and how does it work?"", 'Snippet': 'Nearly three years into the pandemic, China is sticking with a strict COVID-19 containment policy that has caused mounting economic damage and widespread frustration, while keeping its borders ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-excess-deaths-zero-covid-study-rcna101746', 'Headline': 'China had almost 2 million excess deaths after the end of ‘zero-Covid ...', 'Snippet': 'China’s strict zero-Covid policies, which included mass testing, border closures and extended citywide lockdowns, kept Covid cases and deaths to a minimum for much of the pandemic.But when the ...', 'Full_text': 'HONG KONG — There were almost 2 million excess deaths in the two months after China lifted its “zero-Covid” restrictions, a U.S. study found, contradicting official figures from Beijing that have been criticized as too low.\n\nResearchers estimate there were 1.87 million excess deaths from all causes among people 30 years and older from December 2022 to January, according to the study from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle published Thursday. The deaths, which were observed across all mainland Chinese provinces, except Tibet, were predominantly among older people.\n\nChina’s strict zero-Covid policies, which included mass testing, border closures and extended citywide lockdowns, kept Covid cases and deaths to a minimum for much of the pandemic. But when the government abruptly lifted the restrictions in December after rare mass protests across the country, the virus was unleashed on 1.4 billion people who had barely been exposed to it.\n\nThe resulting wave of cases, driven by the highly transmissible omicron variant, brought a huge increase in hospitalizations and deaths that experts say were underreported by officials. They pointed to anecdotal evidence, as well as satellite imagery showing heightened activity at crematoriums and funeral homes.\n\nThe 1.87 million figure is far higher than the official data from China, which said about 60,000 Covid–related deaths had been recorded in health facilities from early December 2022 to Jan. 12.\n\nIt is also consistent with estimates by other researchers, including a study by Zhanwei Du of the University of Hong Kong and Lauren Ancel Meyers of the University of Texas at Austin that found Covid may have killed more than 1.4 million people in China from Dec. 16, 2022 to Jan. 19.\n\nThe estimate from the study released Thursday was based on obituaries published by three Chinese universities for both current and retired employees, as well as searches on Baidu, a popular Chinese internet search engine, for words such as “cremation” and “burial.”\n\n“Our study of excess deaths related to the lifting of the zero-Covid policy in China sets an empirically derived benchmark estimate,” the researchers wrote. “These findings are important for understanding how the sudden propagation of Covid-19 across a population may impact population mortality.”\n\nThe study did appear to be “close to the actual data” based on the research available so far, said Jin Dong-yan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. The way the study estimates data is not “scientifically rigorous,” but it is nonetheless an “objective” and “beneficial” attempt, Jin added.\n\nJin said the actual data could be a few percentage points lower or higher than the study estimates. The university employees used as benchmarks by the study, most of whom are intellectuals living in cities, may be characterized by a stronger self-preparatory awareness, higher vaccination rate, and more accessible health care resources, Jin said. This could be offset since they may also have been more likely to have underlying health conditions than normal people, Jin added.\n\n“The best approach would be for the country to be honest and transparent, disclosing everything just as it was done in previous years such as 2018 and 2019,” Jin said.\n\nOverall, China has reported fewer than 122,000 Covid-related deaths to the World Health Organization. The United States, by comparison, has reported more than 1.1 million Covid-related deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nChinese officials deny they have withheld Covid data from the international community, accusing the U.S., WHO and others of politicizing the pandemic. They say they are still analyzing excess deaths and will have a more complete picture of the Covid death toll at a later date.\n\nCalls to China’s National Health Commission went unanswered Friday.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12853-7', 'Headline': 'A comprehensive evaluation of COVID-19 policies and outcomes in 50 ...', 'Snippet': 'Searches for insomnia have been used to assess the mental impact of COVID-19 8,16,17 more commonly than searches for anxiety, panic attack 17,18, depression 8, or suicide 8. Correlation analyses', 'Full_text': 'The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic unleashed extraordinary challenges on humanity. Governments implemented various policies aimed at containing the spread of infection and stabilizing their economies. Many institutions—including the Economist Intelligence Unit1, Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)2, NLI Research Institute3, and Bloomberg4—have assessed global responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, evaluation criteria differ across these institutions (Supplementary Information 1–3), and their studies have had different focuses and produced varying evaluation results.\n\nHere, we introduce a set of criteria for assessing virus-containment effectiveness, where the aim of containment is to minimize harm to societies and economies. The proposed criteria include several previously examined indicators, namely monthly cases per 100,000 members of a population (per capita), fatality rate, and GDP loss. Additionally, because OxCGRT\'s stringency index (SI)2 cannot reflect rigor accurately based on monthly case numbers (Supplementary Information 4), we propose a lockdown efficiency (LE) parameter, which relates stringency to incidence5 (Supplementary Information 5). We include the following five OxCGRT indicators of health-system policies2: public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, facial coverings, and (from December 2020 onward) vaccination policy.\n\nTo track long-term impacts on health literacy and mental health, we collated data from Google searches for “wash hands”, “face mask”, and “insomnia” as surrogates for national population health literacy and mental health. Surveys on COVID-19–related mental health and health literacy are mostly based on self-reported, cross-sectional studies and rarely multinational6. However, population health literacy and mental health trends have been shown to be reflected in search volume trends7,8. The search engine analysis website Google Trends has been used for population mental-health surveillance as well as for long-term tracking of depression9 and suicide10.\n\nThe availability of COVID-19 vaccines cast new hope for curbing the pandemic. Until August 19, 2021, the World Health Organization had issued only emergency-use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines11. By September 12, 2021, 42% of the worldwide population had received at least one dose of a vaccine12. Therefore, we incorporate vaccine-related indicators into our research.\n\nWe propose a set of ten indices, including four government policy and hygiene education (GP&HE) indicators and six vital health and socioeconomic (VH&SE) measures. Our research is divided into pre- and post-vaccine availability phases. For the first phase (March 2020 to November 2020), we focus on evaluating the appropriateness of the LE indicator, which we developed using linear mixed models to determine how each GP&HE indicator correlates with each VH&SE measure. In the second phase during which there was ongoing vaccine distribution (December 2020 to November 2021), we added vaccine-related indicators to enable more comprehensive containment performance analyses. We compared indicator scores for 50 distinctly governed territories.\n\nOur scoring system, modified from previous studies2,3, includes GP&HE indicators and VH&SE measures. The GP&HE indicators include: LE; health-system policies; health literacy indicators; and vaccine coverage of the population (December 2020 onward). The VH&SE measures include: one-month cases per capita; infection growth rate; fatality rate; GDP loss due to the pandemic; unemployment rate; and psychological impact (Table 1)2,5,13,14,15.\n\nGP&HE indicators\n\nGovernment response is associated with COVID-19 incidence2. Our newly introduced indicator LE is calculated based on COVID-19 incidence data and the SI2, a factor that does not account for COVID-19 incidence. LE has a reasonable correlation with one-month cases per capita (Supplementary Information 4 and 5).\n\nWe developed another indicator called health-system policies, which is a simple average of the four OxCGRT indicators: public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, and facial coverings2. Each of these indicators is derived from daily data, and thus could potentially be represented with monthly means or modes. We used monthly modes as the representative score for each month. From December 2020 onward, we added OxCGRT vaccination policy2 to the calculation of the health-system policies indicator.\n\nHealth literacy is beneficial to reducing the spread of infectious diseases7. Therefore, Google Trends were used to obtain search trends for “wash hands” and “face mask”, which act as surrogate indicators of health literacy7 (Supplementary Information 6).\n\nFor the second phase of the research (December 2020–November 2021), we added the aforementioned indicator people covered by vaccines15 by modifying the calculation of health-system policies to include vaccination policy. This indicator was calculated as the ratio of the number of vaccine doses administered to the number of doses required for full vaccination. For simplicity, we assumed that every individual in each country needs only two doses of vaccine.\n\nVH&SE measures\n\nNLI Research Institute definitions of one-month cases per capita, infection growth rate, and fatality rate were adopted3. Unemployment rate and GDP loss were defined relative to the same timeframe in 2020–2021 and 2019–2020 (Table 1). We quantified change in searches for “insomnia” to indicate the extent of the pandemic’s impact on a population’s mental health. Searches for insomnia have been used to assess the mental impact of COVID-198,16,17 more commonly than searches for anxiety, panic attack17,18, depression8, or suicide8.\n\nCorrelation analyses\n\nIn phase one, linear mixed models were used to explore the relationship between each GP&HE indicator and VH&SE measure. Because these values vary over time and may affect each other, we conducted two-stage analyses (Supplementary Information 4). We tested LE and SI legitimacy2. In phase two, we calculated Spearman\'s rank correlation coefficients to determine whether the indicator “people covered by vaccines” correlates with three vital health indicators, namely one-month cases per capita, infection growth rate, and one-month case fatality rate.\n\nScoring of GP&HE indicators and VH&SE measures\n\nWe ranked the performance of 50 countries and territories according to total indicator scores (Supplementary Information 7 and 8), where a higher score implies better containment performance. We graphed the score distribution (Supplementary Figs. S11-S31) to visualize the relationship between pre-pandemic baseline risk levels and monthly containment scores. We assigned all 50 countries and territories to low, medium, or high baseline risk categories and calculated monthly average containment scores for each risk level (Supplementary Information 9).\n\nGeographic comparison\n\nWe calculated monthly average containment scores for six geographic group and conducted two-sample t-tests and Mann–Whitney U-tests to compare containment performance between Latin American and non-Latin American countries and between Asian and non-Asian countries prior to vaccine introduction (Supplementary Information 10 and 11). Additionally, we compared mean containment performance scores before versus after inclusion of vaccine indicators (Fig. 2).\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted via SAS software (version 9.4); P values were two-tailed with 0.05 significance level.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nWe conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our study results in relation to uncertainties in the indicator calculation methods and the inclusion/exclusion of Google Trends indicators. Nine scenarios were evaluated (e.g. daily score means vs. modes; see Supplementary Table S35). The results obtained with different methods of calculating indices are given in Supplementary Tables S36–S40. Revised calculations with the inclusion of Google Trends are reported in Supplementary Tables S41–S44. The results obtained with the main scenarios (as defined in Table 1) are shown in Supplementary Tables S45 and S46, with the former including Google Trends indicators and the latter excluding Google Trends indicators. For the sensitivity analysis, we compared: (1) data in each of Supplementary Tables S36–S40 to the results in Supplementary Table S46; (2) data in each of Supplementary Tables S41–S44 to the results in Supplementary Table S45; and (3) data in each of Supplementary Tables S36–S39 to data in respective Supplementary Tables S41–S44 (i.e., Supplementary Table S41 vs. Supplementary Table S36, Supplementary Table S42 vs. Supplementary Table S37; Supplementary Table S43 vs. Supplementary Table S38; Supplementary Table S44 vs. Supplementary Table S39).\n\nEthical approval\n\nThe institutional review board of the National Health Research Institutes approved this study (EC1091110-E-R1).\n\nComparison between LE and SI prior to vaccine availability\n\nTwo-stage linear mixed models revealed no reasonable relationship between OxCGRT’s SI and one-month cases per capita (Supplementary Information 4). For each unit increase in the SI in July 2020, the estimated one-month cases per capita in August 2020 increased by 7.83 people (P = 0.03; Supplementary Table S2). Similar trends are observable for other months, contradicting the expectation that an increase in government policies in month s should reduce case numbers in month s + 1.\n\nFor every unit of increase in LE (defined in Table 1) in month s, the estimated one-month cases per capita in month s + 1 decreases. For each unit of increase in LE in September and October 2020, one-month cases per capita in October and November 2020 decrease by 629.55 and 597.94 people, respectively (both P < 0.0001; Supplementary Table S3). Although the relationships between LE and one-month cases per capita are not statistically significant in other months, we observe a consistent downward trend in cases subsequent to lockdowns.\n\nFrom our analyses, we deduce that our LE indicator is legitimate, and that the SI does not have a reasonable correlation with one-month cases per capita. Therefore, we use LE as an indicator in our subsequent evaluation.\n\nTwo stage-linear mixed models also show that the health-system policy in month s does impact fatality in month s + 1 within some periods of time. For every unit of increase in health-system policies in April and May 2020, fatality rates in May and June 2020 decrease by 7.84% and 3.86%, respectively (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table S4).\n\nCOVID-19 containment effectiveness\n\nPerformance scores for citizens’ health literacy and insomnia (Google Trends data) for six territories over the 21-month study period are shown in Fig. 1. All monthly COVID-19 containment rankings and scores from March 2020 to November 2021 are shown in Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 and in Supplementary Tables S13–S33 (Supplementary Information 8 and 12). The best performing countries and territories in 2020 are located mainly in Asia and Oceania, including Taiwan, the Republic of Korea (Korea), and New Zealand.\n\nBaseline risk\n\nLow- and middle-baseline-risk territories are concentrated in Asia, including Vietnam, Korea, and Taiwan, whereas high-baseline-risk nations are located mostly in Europe, including France and the UK. Countries in the Americas span the three risk levels (Fig. 3a). In the first phase, most low- and middle-baseline-risk countries and territories achieved better containment than their high-risk counterparts. Some countries, such as New Zealand and Finland, were able to restrain COVID-19 transmission despite having high baseline risk levels (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Information 9 and Supplementary Fig. S32a).\n\nGeographical comparison prior to vaccine allocation\n\nPrior to vaccine distribution, Latin America was severely impacted by the pandemic, while Oceania and Asia had good containment (Fig. 4a). Non-Latin American nations achieved better overall containment performance than their Latin American counterparts, which were severely affected. From April 2020 to September 2020, performance differed between these two groups, with and without Google Trends data inclusion (P < 0.027; Supplementary Information 10).\n\nAsian governments outperformed their non-Asian counterparts in phase one (Supplementary Information 11). From March to November 2020, with the exception of July 2020, performance scores of Asian countries were higher than those of non-Asian countries, with and without Google Trends data inclusion (P < 0.039).\n\nAsian countries performed dramatically better than non-Asian countries in LE and health-system policies early in the pandemic (April 2020 LE scores P = 0.007; March/April 2020 health-system policy scores P < 0.003). These results suggest that Asian governments enacted effective policies early (Supplementary Information 11).\n\nScoring system robustness\n\nSensitivity analyses revealed that (1) changing indicator calculation methods and (2) adding Google Trends indicators altered overall rankings slightly (Supplementary Information 13).\n\nPerformance after vaccine distribution\n\nThe best performers in 2020 were mostly in Asia and Oceania, including Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Thailand, and New Zealand. After vaccine indicators are included, the containment performance scores of these countries decrease. Inclusion of vaccine indicators from December 2020 onward results in higher containment performance scores in Singapore, Peru, Chile, Colombia, and Argentina (Figs. 2, 3b,c and 4). Among the six geographic regions analyzed, North American countries have the highest vaccine coverage. Their containment performance improves rapidly when vaccine indicators are included. Similar improvements are observed in Europe and Latin America (Fig. 4). Most high-baseline risk countries benefit from their high vaccination coverage (Supplementary Fig. S32).\n\nVaccination coverage\n\nIn the first 6 months of vaccine distribution, one-month cases per capita in month t correlates positively with vaccine coverage in month t and subsequent months. With the exception of the relationship between one-month cases per capita in May 2021 and people covered by vaccines in August 2021, all remaining months correlated (P < 0.0246). In the first 3 months after vaccine distribution ensued (December 2020–February 2021), people covered by vaccines in month t correlated negatively with infection growth rate in the subsequent t + 3, t + 4, or t + 5 months (P < 0.0461). Starting in March 2021, people covered by vaccines correlates negatively with infection growth rate in respective subsequent months, though the relationship does not reach statistical significance for all months. A delayed negative correlation of people covered by vaccines with fatality rate can be seen. Starting from June 2021, the number of people vaccinated in month t correlated negatively with fatality rate in month t and subsequent months (P < 0.0394) (Supplementary Tables S47–S49).\n\nTo evaluate COVID-19 containment performance impartially, we developed and tested a comprehensive evaluation method that accounts for GP&HE indicators, VH&SE measures, and vaccination. LE captures a nation’s effectiveness in enacting measures according to recent incidence. As variants continue to emerge, a new normal, in which pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions are considered should be established. Because it is unreasonable to expect life to normalize completely in the short term, we did not include the global normalcy index19 in our analyses.\n\nOur sensitivity analysis showed that inclusion of the Google Trends indicator altered the overall rankings of the 50 examined countries and territories slightly. We included it for three reasons: Google Trends data reflect health literacy and impacts on mental health7,8; none of the global institutions assessing COVID-19 containment effectiveness have included public responses in their evaluation criteria; and we believe that public response is important for transmission control.\n\nPrior to vaccine allocation, some countries and territories in Asia and Oceania were more successful at suppressing COVID-19 outbreaks than their European and American counterparts. They exhibited a relative weakening of containment performance after inclusion of the vaccine indicator (since December 2020), likely due, at least in part, to their lower vaccination coverage (Supplementary Information 12, Fig. 4).\n\nNew Zealand and Singapore emerged as the most stable performers. New Zealand has been steadfast in its fight against the vexatious COVID-19, increasing its LE to overcome spikes in infection (March/April 2020) and in fatality (May 2020). Successful containment has contributed to their economic stability during the first phase of pandemic (Supplementary Information 12). After New Zealand was invaded by the Delta variant in August 202120, the number of confirmed cases and infection rates increased, and New Zealand responded with an accelerated vaccination strategy (Supplementary Information 12).\n\nAlthough Singapore did not control rapid viral spread initially, they recovered from outbreaks well. Following a 5-month period of rising cases (April–August 2020), the Singapore government improved its health-system policies and LE, leading to decreased case numbers thereafter. Since January 2021, Singapore has been administering vaccines efficiently, making it a model nation for curbing COVID-19 (Supplementary Information 12). However, the surge in coronavirus infections and confirmed cases in Singapore since September 2021 may be related to Singapore’s “coexisting with COVID-19” strategy and the Delta variant outbreak21,22. Whether Singapore can achieve the goal of ""live with the virus"" has become the focus of global attention.\n\nChanges in containment performance scores of six locations associated with notable performance, activities, or policies are shown in Fig. 1. Denmark and the UK have high vaccination coverage23. Denmark lifted restrictions on September 10, 202124. Starting on July 19, 2021, the UK lifted most of its restrictions and removed social distancing recommendations25. In all US regions, restrictions have eased and people have returned to generally normal life26. The 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games took place in Tokyo, Japan from July 23 to August 8 and from August 24 to September 5 of 2021, respectively27. Vietnam was Asia\'s top-performing economy in 202028. Taiwan has been praised for its 253-day streak without local infections29.\n\nDenmark\'s infection growth increased rapidly from September 2020 to January 2021, though their fatality rate remained low. Transmission was mitigated through strict health-system policies, improved LE, and mass vaccinations. Although the number of confirmed cases increased after May 2021, the fatality rate was low. The pandemic within Denmark appeared to be under stable control, but at the end of the study Denmark faced another new wave of outbreaks, the development of which remains to be seen (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nContainment performance in the UK was not satisfactory in phase one. The UK improved LE and health-system policies while administering vaccinations on a massive scale. These efforts enabled a gradual containment of COVID-19 transmission, which was suppressed by March 2021. There was a case/infection growth surge in June 2021 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nThe USA did not control infection well in the first phase, but its containment performance improved in the second phase. They have endured large numbers of confirmed cases with cascading regional surges (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nJapan adopted inclusive health-system policies. Although their confirmed cases increased during the 2021 Olympics, Japan had several prior waves of increased case numbers, including two in 2021 (January and May). Whether the increase in confirmed cases during the Olympics can be attributed to Olympic event gatherings remains to be clarified (Supplementary Information 12).\n\nVietnam performed well in early but experienced a short-term containment performance decline in August 2020. Vietnam controlled an outbreak that emerged in February 2021 successfully. Infection growth in Vietnam has been relatively high since May 2021, and was only slightly contained until October, but then increased again in November. Transmission in late summer 2021 may reflect Delta variant invasion under low vaccination coverage (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nTaiwan is an exemplary case. COVID-19 transmission was suppressed early owing to a rapid response by Taiwan\'s Central Epidemic Command Center with cooperation from local government agencies and the public30. Taiwan suffered a case surge under low vaccine coverage in May and June 2021. The Central Epidemic Command Center responded with intensive data gathering, expansive testing, quarantines, and stringent non-pharmaceutical policies31. Faced with the highly transmissible Delta variant, Taiwan suppressed case numbers within 2 ~ 3 months (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nWhile countries seek to increase vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness has been tested by the Delta variant and breakthrough infections. In addition to vaccination, non-pharmacological interventions, such as handwashing, masking, and physical distancing, remain important for preventing transmission.\n\nPublic health implications\n\nOur research suggests that the top performing nations tend to enact rigorous health system policies and locally-appropriate lockdown measures, especially early in the pandemic (Supplementary Information 12, and Supplementary Table S11). Asian countries’ border control policies were implemented earlier than non-Asian countries. In Asian and non-Asian countries, the median times to any border closure from the first reported case in China were 24.50 and 67.50 days, respectively (P = 0.0003), and the median times to any border closure from the first domestic case within each country were -10.50 and 8.00 days, respectively (P = 0.0027) (Supplementary Table S50, Supplementary Information 15). Notwithstanding, stringent lockdown measures should not be enacted without careful consideration, and lockdown policies should be adjusted in response to recent incidence. Flexibility in their implementation can yield containment with minimal harm to societies, economies, and mental health.\n\nLimitations\n\nSeveral methodological limitations should be noted. First, we include unemployment rate and GDP loss, but not international aid, economic stimulus packages, or other fiscal measures. Second, Google Trends data do not represent a random sampling and may exclude vulnerable groups without internet access or those not actively searching. Third, ideally, only local infection rates should be considered to obtain precise LE measurements. However, because daily local case data are not fully available, we used incidence data inclusive of imported cases to determine LE scores. Therefore, minor inaccuracies in our LE data are expected (Supplementary Information 5).'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9020804/', 'Headline': 'Dynamic zero COVID policy in the fight against COVID', 'Snippet': 'The city went into full lockdown on April 5, 2022.

It may still be losing jobs. Illinois ranked No. 2 for highest unemployment in November.\n\nIllinois’ employment gains have been overestimated, showing a gain when they should have shown a loss in the spring, according to a report Dec. 13 from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n\nThose losses may be continuing, as the state ranked No. 2 in November for highest unemployment in the U.S.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Employment Security in conjunction with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics originally estimated the state added 35,800 jobs from mid-March through mid-June 2022. The Fed reported more detailed data shows that was wrong: the state lost jobs during that time.\n\nThe overestimation of job gains, which are calculated based on Current Employer Survey data, may help to explain why Illinois’ unemployment rate continues to increase despite the state reporting job growth. Illinois’ unemployment rate of 4.7% is second highest in the nation, behind only Nevada.\n\nState unemployment figures, which are based on household survey data, suggest employment in Illinois has been declining since August.\n\nBecause of the conflicting estimates, the Illinois Department of Employment Security continues to report the state is adding jobs, reportedly gaining 17,500 jobs in November.\n\nLeading the month’s job growth was the leisure and hospitality sector with 10,700 jobs added; professional and business services added 5,800 jobs; education and health added 3,500 jobs; construction added 2,400 jobs for the month; and financial services and other services added 1,400 jobs and 1,000 jobs, respectively.\n\nDespite overall job growth for November, five of the state’s 11 sectors suffered job losses for the month. Leading the losses for November was the trade, transportation and utilities sector as it shed 4,300 jobs; the government sector lost 1,700 jobs; manufacturing lost 1,000 jobs, while the information sector lost 200 jobs and mining lost 100 in November.\n\nDespite continued estimates of jobs growth, Illinois is still missing 41,500 jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, while the analysis from the Federal Reserve suggests this number may be even larger. There will be a clearer picture of Illinois’ labor market when the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts benchmark revisions to their estimates in March 2023.\n\nRegardless of what the data will ultimately show, Illinois’ labor market will have to contend with serious headwinds in the new year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve continued to pursue interest rate hikes in order combat inflation, boosting rates another 75 basis points for November. Inflation remained high at 7.1% for November. Interest rates are now the highest they have been since 2008 and the Great Recession, with the Fed continuing to signal more rate hikes are coming, although possibly at a slower pace. It raised its benchmark rate half a point Dec. 14 to a target range of 4.25 to 4.5% – the highest rate in 15 years. The Federal Reserve’s policymakers are predicting higher unemployment and slower economic growth in both 2023 and 2024, with the economy forecast to grow just 0.5% next year.\n\nOther recession warning signs have been making news recently. Fitch Ratings is expecting a recession by the second quarter of 2023. It stated a recession is likely to be similar to the 1990-1991 recession, which lasted nine months, but is also expected to be milder than the one from 30 years ago. A recent Bloomberg Economics model projects there is now a 100% chance of a recession in the next 12 months. Morgan Stanley’s Chief U.S. Equity Strategist & Chief Investment Officer, Mike Wilson, believes earnings losses in 2023 could rival those of 2008.\n\nThe concerning jobs and unemployment figures are a bad sign for Illinois’ economy should a downturn take place. Illinoisans suffered more than most Americans during the Great Recession. Because the state still hasn’t recovered from the pandemic, it remains vulnerable to suffering more severely than other states should a recession occur.\n\nIllinois has a tendency to struggle to recover from economic downturns compared to the rest of the nation, as it did after the Great Recession and is doing now after the pandemic. During the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009, Illinois’ economy shrank by nearly 5% compared to a 3.2% drop in the rest of the nation. Then it lagged the recovery from 2009 to 2017, growing by 10.6% while the rest of the nation grew by 17.1%.\n\nWith the passage of Amendment 1, Illinois’ $313 billion pension debt will likely continue to balloon as state and local taxes, which are already among the highest in the nation, rise in an attempt to keep up without reform to the pension system. If property taxes continue to rise at their recent rate, homeowners can expect to pay more than $2,100 during the next four years.

Having enlisted in the US Air Force (USAF) straight out of high school in 2003, she protected bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, protected USAF bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Katar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAt one point, she had even guarded the seat of the US government, serving in an Air National Guard unit known as the ""Capital Guardians"" at a base near Washington DC. In 2013, she was part of the DC Air National Guard’s security detail for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nBabbitt grew up in Lakeside, California, not far from San Diego, the oldest sister to four younger brothers. One former classmate told Insider that she was ""disruptive"" in class, highly opinionated and always trying to be ""one of the guys"".\n\nThat bolshy nature survived throughout her service, with former comrades saying she struggled to be promoted and was demoted at least once due to spats with superiors. One friend described her as ""small but mighty"" (Babbitt was 5 feet 2 inches tall), unafraid to contradict her officers when she disagreed.\n\n""Ashli was headstrong and impulsive,"" said Sgt Eirik Blackwolf, who served with her in the DC Air National Guard. ""She didn’t hold back on her opinion to anyone, no matter their rank, especially if she thought they were wrong or behaving unethically.""\n\nDuring one deployment Babbitt was injured in a mortar strike that knocked her onto a pile of debris. Augustine Luna, a close friend, told Insider that the impact damaged Babbitt’s uterus and left her unable to bear children, but that Babbitt rarely mentioned this.\n\nIn 2015 Babbitt began working as a private security guard for a nuclear power plant in Maryland, where she met her future second husband Aaron Babbitt. That was also the year Mr Babbitt’s then-girlfriend Celeste Norris first encountered Ashli.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ms Norris said Mr Babbitt at first described the new girl as ""this foul-mouthed chick that’s on shift"". Later, Ms Norris found out the two were dating, and broke up with Mr Babbitt.\n\nThe next year, Ms Norris said, she was waiting at a stop sign when a white SUV barged through nearby traffic and repeatedly rammed into her car. When they stopped, Babbitt got out and began hammering with her hand on the window. ""It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was,"" said Ms Norris. ""Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.""\n\nA court acquitted Babbitt of criminal charges, but Ms Norris secured a restraining order against her, and later mounted a personal injury lawsuit that Babbitt settled out of court. In court documents from 2017, Ms Norris wrote that Babbitt had continued to follow her home from work and harass her. ""I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,"" she told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Babbitt moved to San Diego to help buy out and run a swimming pool supply company where her brothers, her uncle and her husband all worked together. ""It was kind of nice, a family affair,"" her brother Roger said.\n\nBabbitt and her husband became daily customers at a brewery near the San Diego sea front, often with their three ex-military dogs in tow. According to brewery owner Jim Millea, the pair had a polyamorous relationship with one of his bartenders. Babbitt herself often arrived fuming about a political issue that had grabbed her attention.\n\nYet the pool supply business quickly got into trouble. Babbitt took out a short term business loan with a steep interest rate and was sued by the lender for failing to make payments, ultimately being ordered by a judge to pay it all back. In 2019, she sold the house where her parents had lived for nearly 20 years, reportedly making them feel ""kicked out of their own home"".\n\nBy this time, Babbitt was a staunch Trump supporter and an opponent of lockdown measures. Her company’s office bore a sign reading: ""Mask-free autonomous zone, better known As America"".\n\nHer brother told the New York Times that she had felt free after leaving the military, and had been angry with the number of homeless people in San Diego and the challenges for small business owners.\n\nOne customer told CBS 8 San Diego that he dropped Babbitt’s company after she went on an unprovoked political rant. “She just started talking about people who oppose Trump and about Nancy Pelosi and [Chuck] Schumer and homeless people,"" the customer said. ""A lot of it didn’t even make any sense. It literally went on for about a minute and a half... it was shocking that she would be talking to a customer the way she was talking to me.""\n\nEven so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents. ""I don’t really know why she decided to do this,"" her mother-in-law toldFox 5 Washington DC last year.\n\nHer social media accounts, however, told an all too familiar story.\n\n‘Nothing will stop us’\n\nOn 7 September, 2020, tweeting under the username @CommonSenseAsh, Ashli Babbitt posted a photo of herself smiling in sunglasses and a black tank top, posing in front of an old-fashioned boat in the harbour of San Diego.\n\nTo many the photo might have looked innocuous, a happy selfie from a nice day out. But her shirt bore the slogan ""We are Q"" – a reference to the anonymous purported government insider who inspired the cult-like millenarian movement known as QAnon.\n\nFor almost a year, Babbitt had been posting in support of QAnon, which believes Mr Trump’s Democratic opponents are part of a global Satanist paedophile ring. Adherents think Mr Trump himself is the figurehead for a secret plot by ""white hats"" (ie, good guys) to sweep the Satanists from power in a military coup, resulting in mass imprisonment or execution.\n\nThe movement has been tied to violent acts including murders, kidnappings, terror plots, attempted bombings, and vehicular attacks, as well as campaigns of online harassment and death threats.\n\nBabbitt’s radical shift came gradually. Back in 2018, she had told another user that she had voted for Barack Obama and still believed he had done ""great things"", but had turned to Mr Trump because she could not stomach Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Ms Luna, Babbitt had voted for Trump in 2016 because he was not a career politician, but soon began calling Democrats ""commies"" and skirmished aggressively offline and online with anyone who disputed her anti-mask beliefs.\n\nIn November 2019, she tweeted about Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that went viral among Trump supporters in 2016 and was a key precursor to QAnon. Online activists had fixated on chance words in hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders as evidence of a secret child sex dungeon beneath a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. Later one of them stormed the restaurant with a rifle to rescue the supposed children, but found nothing.\n\nIn February 2020, Babbitt tweeted her first of many QAnon slogans. Most often she retweeted QAnon influencers such as the lawyer Lin Wood. Ms Luna told Insider that Babbitt was drawn in by the idea that children were in danger, spending hours every week reading about missing kids and appalled that QAnon’s claims were not being taken seriously in the mainstream media.\n\nAccording to Prof Mia Bloom, a terrorism researcher at Georgia University, QAnon’s appeals to ""save the children"" are ""almost verbatim"" how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) recruited three British schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, London, in 2015.\n\n""This kind of message that builds upon someone’s innate goodness is a very different pathway into terrorism than we ordinarily think,"" says Prof Bloom. ""We assume that it’s about hatred, it’s about violence, it’s about racism and white supremacy on the Right and jihadi ideology for [Islamic] groups, when in fact a lot of the pull factors can be based in what we would consider to be very positive attributes.""\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Babbitt did not accept the results of the 2020 election and plunged wholeheartedly into the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. On 1 January, 2021, Babbitt tweeted that she would be in Washington DC on the 6th for a rally addressed by Mr Trump.\n\nOn 5 January, she boarded a plane in San Diego and texted to her friend that there were ""tons of Trump supporters"" flying with her. Another user tweeted that some flights to DC were being cancelled, supposedly to prevent people from attending the 6 January rally.\n\nBabbitt replied: ""Nothing will stop us. They can try and try and try, but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.""\n\nWhen Trump’s army stormed the Capitol, Ashli Babbitt was among the mob that gathered in a stairwell near the chamber of the House of Representatives, where up to 80 members of congress and staff were sheltering. She was wearing a Trump flag on her shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe crowd began hammering on the doors out of the stairwell, which were barricaded from the other side with furniture. One window broke, and Ashli Babbitt, who was unarmed, climbed through. A gunshot rang out, and she fell back with a bullet in her shoulder.\n\nPro-Trump activists have found their George Floyd\n\nLast August, the police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt finally broke his silence. For months Lt Michael Byrd, who is black, had been in hiding due to repeated death threats and racist attacks after Mr Trump falsely claimed he worked for a ""high-ranking"" Democratic politician.\n\n""I know that day I saved countless lives,"" Lt Byrd told NBC News. “I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nBabbitt did not become a Trumpist hero overnight. The day after the riot, Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin, who saw Babbitt’s death, said that Lt Byrd had not had any choice. ""The mob was going to come through the door,"" he told ABC. ""There was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many Trump supporters believed she was a plant or a stooge, put into the crowd by the FBI or other dark forces. In April, the US Department of Justice closed its investigation with no criminal charges.\n\nBy the time of Lt Byrd’s interview, however, Babbitt’s name had become a clarion call in what Ms Castronuova calls the conservative ""underground"" of alternative media and social media. Ms Castronuova was among the first people to interview Babbitt’s family on InfoWars, a fringe news site that often promotes conspiracy theories and has been banned from most major social networks for hate speech.\n\n""[Trump] is really in tune with the community, his base,"" Ms Castronuova says. ""The underground will start to buzz, then Donald Trump picks up on it."" Soon enough, at rallies and in interviews last summer, Mr Trump was calling Babbitt ""an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman"", someone who was on his ""side"", and said there was ""no reason for"" her to die. Ms Castronuova says his backing was ""instrumental"".\n\nMr Trump’s efforts increased after a personal phone call to Mrs Witthoeft, who had become politically active. She has now spoken at a Trump rally and has backed her daughter’s actions, saying: ""She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.""\n\nMs Castronuova says: ""[Babbitt’s] mother has been really instrumental too. She became quite an advocate. She was afraid to speak out at first... but when she finally started speaking out, things really started to change.""\n\nBabbitt’s family sued the District of Columbia to uncover Lt Byrd’s identity, and plans to file wrongful death lawsuits against Lt Byrd himself and the Capitol Police. Terrell Roberts III, a lawyer for Babbitt’s husband Aaron, declined to comment and declined an interview on Mr Babbitt’s behalf.\n\nDonations to Mr Babbitt’s legal fund continue to roll in, with many donors identifying themselves as military veterans. Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating Democratic secrets.\n\nMany Trump supporters have compared Babbitt to George Floyd, a black man murdered by police in Minnesota, lifting the Black Lives Matter slogan ""say her name"" used in reference to many victims of police brutality.\n\nOn the private messaging app Telegram, which is popular on the far right, pro-Trump channels frequently invoke Babbitt’s name, sharing news articles about her family’s lawsuit or claiming that she was set up by informants. Many asked the question ""who killed Ashli Babbit?"" which Mr Trump later echoed.\n\n""The entire scenario looks to be staged. So who is the rotting fish head of what appears to be a deliberate false flag? Who or what group set this up?"" said the evangelist channel Veteran Patriots. The Proud Boys, a fascist militia, have begun using a stylised image of Babbitt as a logo, with the slogan: ""They can’t kill us all.""\n\nBritish radicals have also taken up her cause. ""Her name was Ashli Babbitt,"" said British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. ""She was murdered by the state and her name was dragged through the mud by the media."" An account identifying itself as former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has invoked her name several times.\n\nSome appear to believe she is not even dead. ""Ashli Babbitt false [is a] flag, she’s alive living underground,"" said a QAnon channel called Gitmo TV.\n\n‘A weapon of mass radicalisation’\n\nTo Prof Bloom, Babbitt’s transformation into an innocent victim of Leftist injustice has a worrying historical echo: Horst Wessel, the young Nazi street-fighter who was turned into a symbol of fascist heroism by Josef Goebbel’s propaganda apparatus.\n\nWessel was shot in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party, probably as part of a dispute over unpaid rent with his Communist landlady. By 1936, after the Nazis took power, official media referred to him as greater than Jesus Christ and the Horst Wessel Song was Germany’s joint national anthem.\n\n""Fake martyrdoms succeed because they feed off the shared grievances and anger of the crowd, serving as justification for future retaliatory violence,"" wrote Prof Bloom and another researcher, Sophia Moskalenko, with whom Prof Bloom has co-authored a book about QAnon. ""Ashli Babbitt’s unfortunate death is a weapon of mass radicalisation, just like Horst Wessel’s death was manipulated by Goebbels.""\n\nIndeed, the Nazis’ modern successors have particularly embraced Babbitt, turning an enthusiastic Trump supporter with a chequered past who was killed in a chaotic riot into a towering hero or innocent victim of police brutality while seeking to pin the blame on black and Jewish people.\n\n""Unlike ‘Saint Floyd’, Ashli Babbitt will receive no justice from this sick anti-white system,"" said one white supremacist Telegram channel. ""But we will always remember her sacrifice and she will never be forgotten. There is a day coming not far from now when we will erect statues in her honor.""\n\nThe same channel referred to Lt Byrd as a ""black parasite who gets to kill an unarmed white woman and walk around unbothered"", threatening to make him ""account for his actions"". Another neo-Nazi channel claimed that ""Ashli Babbitt was killed because she was white"".\n\nAlex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates against antisemitism and other forms of racism, says such messages are part of a widespread effort by white supremacists to lure recruits from the broader pro-Trump community.\n\n""White supremacists will always try to twist whatever major story is in the news to fit their agenda,"" says Mr Friedfeld. It’s unclear how successful these efforts have been, but the fact that they are trying to leverage the Babbitt story is deeply concerning because it raises the likelihood that someone is radicalised.""\n\nProf Bloom agrees, comparing it to the Proud Boys’ attempts last summer to recruit ""incel"" anti-feminists. She says that while many QAnon believers are not consciously racist, and not all are white, the movement has a pervasive racial bias, with trafficked children usually depicted as white whereas real world child trafficking disproportionately affects children of colour.\n\nProf Bloom also points out that another protester, Rosanne Boyland, died during the riot but has not been turned into a martyr in the same way. The reason, she argues, is that unlike Babbitt’s family, the Boyland’s have blamed Mr Trump for their loved one’s death.\n\nA threat from within America’s military\n\nThe martyrdom of Ashli Babbitt paints a foreboding picture of where American politics is going. To Prof Bloom and Prof Moskalenko, martyrs are a ubiquitous manufactured product of radical movements, useful because of their potency in rallying followers to stay in the fight and seek revenge against the enemy.\n\nMs Castronuova stops short of saying Babbitt was an example others should follow, describing her as a good person sucked into an ""emotionally charged"" and chaotic situation. She is happy to call Babbitt a martyr, claiming: ""She was killed because of her political beliefs, and they continue to kill her image and her memory because of her political beliefs. If she was a liberal and she hated Donald Trump, she would be remembered very fondly by the media.""\n\nMr Friedfelder, however, fears that Babbitt’s lionisation could contribute to an escalating cycle of conflict, and considers politicians’ embrace of Babbitt to be dangerous. While most Republicans have not embraced the idea that she was unjustly killed, few have publicly rebuked it, apparently reluctant to openly challenge Mr Trump even now he is out of office.\n\nThat does not mean they are happy behind the scenes. On Wednesday Mr Trump cancelled a press conference on the anniversary of the riot, reportedly under pressure from mainstream Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he had played golf with Mr Trump at the weekend and warned him that there ""could be peril"" in such an event. Still, history suggests that Mr Trump’s concessions to moderates are rarely permanent.\n\nMr Friedfelder says: ""Her martyrdom turns her into a call to action... it is one thing for extremists to embrace Babbitt, but it is another for the former president and several high-profile members of the Republican Party to do the same. These officials are supposed to be trusted figures and people look to them for guidance when trying to understand national events.""\n\nClaims that Babbitt was murdered or assassinated continue to spread on social media, according to data from the online discussion tracking firm Zignal Labs. Mr Trump’s and Mr Putin’s comments caused spikes in mentions of Babbitt, and the general discussion around 6 January has barely waned over the past year.\n\nProf Bloom believes there is a more acute threat too: Babbitt’s military record. According to a report from START, an academic coalition that studies terrorism, at least 118 of the 719 people charged in connection with the riot, about 16 per cent of the whole, are veterans. In a START extremism database, about 7 per cent of all far-right cases had military experience, with the rest simply listed as unknown.\n\n""We don’t know how many American military [members] have been radicalised, either by MAGA or specifically by QAnon and white supremacy,"" says Prof Bloom. ""There has been a problem of white supremacy in the military for decades that the military has been reticent to deal with.\n\n""It’s dangerous because it’s not just some flunky who wants to make a name for themselves. It’s someone with military training who has weapons and knows how to use them."" She compares most pro-Trump extremists with the bumbling jihadists in 2010’s Four Lions, with lots of anger but limited ways to direct it. ""When you have someone who has been trained by the military or law enforcement, they know how to use that anger.""\n\nProf Moskalenko worries that the conditions are set for yet more political violence in America. ""A martyrdom is a symbol of perceived widespread injustice and suffering. There’s a lot of that going around,"" she says. ""With or without Ashli Babbit, we have problems. Addressing them, rather than getting stuck in the never-ending cycle of rhetoric, competing narratives, and shifting moral frames, is our only hope.""'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://apnews.com/article/ashli-babbitt-capitol-siege-a15c7e52a04d932972b7a284c7a8f7df', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a martyr?

But the life of the 35-year-old Air Force veteran from California, Ashli Babbitt, was far more complicated. In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors.

More references from Alan Hostetter to “crisis actors” on Jan 6', 'Full_text': 'A former police chief in La Habra, California, who went on to become a yoga instructor and a convicted felon for his actions on Jan. 6 was sentenced Thursday to more than 11 years in prison, but not before he claimed Ashli Babbitt isn’t actually dead — even as Babbitt’s mom looked on in court.\n\nAlan Hostetter, unlike his Three Percenter “DC Brigade” co-defendants found guilty by a jury in November, was convicted of four charges after a July bench trial before Senior U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas. He must reportedly surrender on or after Jan. 5, 2024.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://reason.com/2022/01/04/ashli-babbitts-violent-past-doesnt-justify-her-death/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's Violent Past Doesn't Justify Her Death - Reason.com"", 'Snippet': ""On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli Babbitt, the Capitol rioter who was shot and killed by a police officer while trying to enter the Speaker's Lobby on January 6."", 'Full_text': 'On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli Babbitt, the Capitol rioter who was shot and killed by a police officer while trying to enter the Speaker\'s Lobby on January 6. In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://fox5sandiego.com/news/national-news/ashli-babbitt-a-martyr-her-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a martyr?

When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nREAD MORE: Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot\n\nBabbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed. The officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\nHer husband, Aaron, declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris viewed her.\n\nCourt records involving the 2016 violent confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nNorris later got a judicial order that barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family.\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/01/06/ashli-babbitts-mom-defends-daughters-actions-at-jan-6riot/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's mom defends daughter's actions at Jan. 6riot"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt was a 36-year-old Air Force veteran and Trump supporter.

Michael Byrd as she tried to crawl through a broken window to enter the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021 as a mob of Trump supporters were storming the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“My daughter was a proud American patriot,” Witthoeft said. “She served this country her whole adult life. She loved God, America and loved her family.”\n\nWitthoeft then claimed her daughter was “murdered by a careless, reckless” Capitol Police officer.\n\n“She came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election, and little did we know that would be the last time she heard anybody speak,” the grieving mom said.\n\nByrd was exonerated of any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death in an internal use-of-force probe.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News last August, Byrd said he was “doing my job” and saw Babbitt as a threat to lawmakers in the House of Representatives.\n\n“I was very afraid,” Byrd told anchor Lester Holt. “I’m hearing about the breaches of different barricaded areas, officers being overrun, officers being down.”\n\nWitthoeft also called for the release of 14,000 hours of video captured on security cameras in the Capitol.\n\n“I would like to say to [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi, this is not your playhouse. These surveillance cameras were put up to capture what happened that day and the American people have the right to see the 14,000 hours of footage,” she said. “You’re not the queen, Nancy Pelosi, this is America’s 14,000 hours of missing footage and we have a right to see it.”\n\nCapitol Police and prosecutors have refused to release the footage, because they contend it could threaten the security of the building.\n\nBut federal judge Beryl Howell ruled in September that the “public has an interest in understanding the conduct underlying the charges in these cases” and ordered the footage to be released in the trial of protester Eric Torrens of Tennessee.\n\n“The Capitol police operate with impunity, which I did not know until my daughter was publicly executed,” Witthoeft said.\n\n“I think most of America does not know the Capitol police department is not subject to transparency – they are another arm of Congress and don’t answer to an external review like every other police department in this country,” she said.\n\nThe Justice Department has arrested and charged more than 725 people for their involvement in the Capitol attacks.\n\nWitthoeft said those arrested are being held unfairly.\n\n“We have political prisoners in America, not some third world country, to this day in solitary confinement denied due process.

Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}}",92.9,2

An email to Logan Wednesday resulted in an automatic reply saying the company ""has gone out-of-business and is no longer taking on new work.""\n\nLogan told Fann in a series of texts on Jan. 3 that he closed the company and that ""all employees"" were let go on Jan. 2.\n\n""I was unable to find a buyer for Cyber Ninjas. Too much negativity around the name,"" Logan said in one text. ""I\'m trying to get another company setup to hopefully employ some of my former employees and lessen the impact to them, but I\'ve been hitting all sorts of obsticals in doing so.""\n\nThe number of employees working for Cyber Ninjas is unclear.\n\nIn April 2020, Logan listed on federal loan paperwork that he had five employees. A lawyer for the company told a court in September the company had seven employees.\n\nBut when it came to the Arizona ballot review, Logan appeared to be working alone. The only sign another employee was involved was an email sent by an executive assistant to the Senate inquiring about a payment, The Arizona Republic found.\n\nLogan told Fann the Senate wasn\'t honoring its commitments to the company, a likely reference to $100,000 payment Fann has withheld.\n\nFann accused the company in October of breaching its contract for not turning over audit records to the Senate. Two months later, in December, Fann said she would pay Cyber Ninjas the full contract amount once the audit is completed.\n\nShe said the Senate is still waiting on an independent examination of the county\'s routers and internet-activity logs, to answer questions raised by the contractors about whether vote-tabulation machines were connected to the internet.\n\nTexts shed light on election audit situation\n\nLogan told Fann in the texts that the Senate no longer has his back and he\'s known for some time their interests no longer align.\n\n""The actions chosen through all of this speak quite a bit louder than the words; and make it clear the Senate has no intention of honoring what was committed to,"" Logan said in the texts. ""The choice has been made to try what can legally be gotten away with rather than what is ethical or right.""\n\nMore: Cyber Ninjas reports losing more than $2M on Arizona election review\n\nThe Associated Press first reported on the texts after obtaining them from the Senate through a public records request.\n\nThe Senate did not release the actual messages Logan sent to Fann. Rather, they were copied and pasted onto another document. Senate lawyer Chris Kleminich said Wednesday that Fann never responded to Logan. No other lawmakers exchanged texts with Logan, he said.\n\nLogan said in the texts that communicating with the Senate is likely not in his best interests.\n\n""People think I\'m just naive because I choose to act and assume the best of people; but I believe its what Scripture calls me to do,"" he said. “I have no intention of throwing you or anyone else under the bus, but I expect the time has also come for me to stop completely covering for decisions I didn\'t make,"" Logan said.\n\nWhat\'s next for Doug Logan and Cyber Ninjas?\n\nLogan said that he was liquidating all of Cyber Ninjas\' assets to pay his debts but had ""no doubt"" he would default on the public records cases. He indicated bankruptcy was imminent.\n\n“When we finally file for bankrupcy, which I am trying to wait as long as possible before doing; it will be up to the bankrupcy court to decide what to do with the money owed,"" Logan wrote.\n\nCorporate bankruptcy might not be enough to get Logan off the hook with the court.\n\nOn Jan. 6, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge John Hannah found Cyber Ninjas in contempt and ordered the company to pay $50,000 a day until it turns over records to The Republic, which filed a public records lawsuit against the Senate and Cyber Ninjas.\n\nA left-leaning watchdog group called American Oversight also has sued the Senate for records from its election review.\n\nHannah said the court would not ""accept the assertion that Cyber Ninjas is an empty shell."" If the company doesn\'t turn over the records, Hannah said he would issue orders directly against the individuals responsible.\n\nCyber Ninjas\' Arizona lawyer, Jack Wilenchik, tried to remove himself as the firm\'s attorney during the Jan. 6 hearing, saying he wasn\'t being paid. Hannah rejected the request, saying the case was too important to leave Cyber Ninjas without a replacement.\n\nWilenchik on Wednesday filed a court motion requesting that Hannah be removed from the case. He claimed the judge had made negative comments about the partisan election review in an unrelated case and had donated to organizations opposed to former President Donald Trump.\n\nWhat documents need to be turned over?\n\nCyber Ninjas has turned over some records to the Senate, but it remains unclear how many documents the company still has related to the audit that are subject to court orders. At one point in the long-running case, the company suggested it might have 60,000 responsive documents.\n\nCyber Ninjas, a cybersecurity firm, had almost no election related experience when Fann tapped it to lead the review, which she has called the ""the most detailed, demanding, and uncompromising election audit that has ever been conducted.""\n\nIn addition to its $150,000 contract with the Senate, Cyber Ninjas and its subcontractors got millions more from nonprofits set up by Trump allies and prominent figures in the “Stop the Steal” movement.\n\nLogan announced at a Sept. 24 Senate hearing the hand count showed President Joe Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County, and the numbers closely matched the county\'s certified election results from November.\n\nLogan\'s reports to the Senate, however, skimmed over the outcomes and focused on perceived voting irregularities. His analysis sowed doubts about results of the election process that his company\'s hand count had just confirmed.\n\nIndependent election analysts and data experts say Logan\'s numbers crumble under scrutiny. In a series of reports beginning in October, a team of analysts described the Cyber Ninjas\' findings as ""fiction."" They said the hand count was off by about 312,000 and also double counted almost 23,000 ballots.\n\nMaricopa County elections officials on Jan. 5 issued a scathing rebuttal to Cyber Ninjas\' claims of election irregularities. The 93-page report studied every question the contractors raised about the election and analyzed thousands of individual voter records.\n\nRather than 50,000 questionable ballots cited by Cyber Ninjas, the county found 37 cases of potential fraud and 50 ballots that were double counted.\n\nCorporation records shed scant light on Logan\'s next venture. In March, paperwork was filed for a company using the same Florida postal box address as the one used by Cyber Ninjas.\n\nThe company, called Akolytos LLC, was established by the same company that registered Cyber Ninjas at an address in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe name comes from the Book of Acts in the New Testament of the Bible.

Warren Petersen, who heads the judiciary committee, were telling Doug Logan and others involved in the “audit.”\n\nLogan heads Cyber Ninjas, the inexperienced firm the Senate hired to oversee the audit of computers and ballot counting machines and recount by hand 2.1 million ballots cast in 2020’s election in Maricopa County.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s win led former President Donald Trump to allege without evidence that he lost in Arizona and other battleground states because of fraud. The Senate then launched the review, which found the ballot count results were true.\n\nLogan’s report did raise a series of other claims about potential problems with the election, most since disproven. They include the potential for election equipment to be connected to the internet or that large numbers of ballots were cast by dead voters.\n\nREAD MORE: Across the country, Republican primaries feature candidates who deny outcome of 2020 election\n\nThe ruling written by Justice John Lopez says legislative privilege applies because the audit was part of an investigation that could conceivably lead to new election laws. That is enough to shield the approximately 1,000 emails, text messages and other communications the Senate refused to release.\n\n“The Audit is a legislative activity within the legislature’s authority, and communications concerning this activity are covered by legislative privilege,” Lopez wrote. “Consequently, the Senate’s internal communications concerning the authorization, planning, and findings of the Audit investigation are privileged.”\n\nThe ruling overturns both a trial court judge and the state court of appeals, which took narrow views of legislative privilege and held that the public had a right to know what senators discussed about the audit.\n\n“It’s a win for the Senate on every issue unanimously,” said Kory Langhofer, the Senate’s lawyer. “It couldn’t be a better ruling.”\n\nThe Senate will have to reveal any records that are political in nature or involve the administration of the audit itself, but the Senate had already agreed to do that.\n\nFann said in a statement that the Senate’s position that the records could be kept secret was supported by “decades of precedent” from state and federal courts.\n\n“We absolutely believe in transparency, however, there are times when legislative privilege should be exercised so that we can do the jobs that the people of Arizona elected us to carry out,” Fann said.\n\nThe public records lawsuit the court decided was filed by a watchdog group called American Oversight, which pushes for government transparency, shortly after the audit was launched in spring 2021.\n\nThe Senate disclosed more than 20,000 records after court orders prompted by lawsuits filed by American Oversight and the Arizona Republic, orders that the Supreme Court refused to block last year. But it withheld all or part of about 1,000 other documents, citing legislative privilege meant to promote robust debate among elected officials.\n\nWATCH: Primary victories showcase strength of the ‘Big Lie’ in the Republican Party\n\nThe court of appeals said privilege did not apply because the audit was mainly political, no legislation was being considered and the Senate failed to show releasing the documents would impair its deliberations. The Supreme Court rejected those findings, which American Oversight said will keep important information hidden from public view.\n\n“While legislative privilege should protect legitimate functions of the legislature, extending the privilege to activities that the Court recognized as uniquely politicized is misguided,” American Oversight Executive Director Heather Sawyer said in a statement. “This ruling makes it easier for officials to hide the truth about their motives and conduct from the public.”\n\nThe high court ordered the judge who issued the initial ruling saying the records must be released to review an updated “privilege log,” filed by the Senate’s lawyers. But the Supreme Court said the judge cannot review the records to make sure the Senate is not withholding records that should be released.\n\nIn concluding his ruling, Lopez noted that disputes over the 2020 election continue to be “a central focus of the political realm, a matter outside this Court’s constitutional prerogative.”\n\nHe said the ruling followed longstanding precedent preserving separation of powers and guards lawmaker’s ability to do their jobs without undue interference. And he said if the public does not like what they do, they have a way to deal with that.\n\n“Arizona legislators routinely stand for election and, thus, are accountable to the state’s electorate who serve as the ultimate arbiters of the wisdom of any legislative action, rather than the courts,” Lopez wrote.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/lawyer-for-arizona-senate-election-audit-firm-wants-to-quit1', 'Headline': 'Lawyer for Arizona Senate election audit firm wants to quit', 'Snippet': 'The attorney representing the private company that oversaw the Arizona Senate’s partisan review of Maricopa County’s 2020 election results is trying to quit after a series of losses in cases ...', 'Full_text': 'The attorney representing the private company that oversaw the Arizona Senate’s partisan review of Maricopa County’s 2020 election results is trying to quit after a series of losses in cases brought by groups seeking records of the ""audit.""\n\nThe move to withdraw by attorney Jack Wilenchik is opposed by American Oversight, a government watchdog group that has for months been seeking records held by Florida-based Cyber Ninjas.\n\nAmerican Oversight’s lawyer said in a court filing Monday that allowing Wilenchik to quit will just delay resolution of the case and prevent the public from knowing how the Senate and its contractors conducted the review.

The high court has declined to put the lower court orders on hold and could consider the appeal next month.

Wilenchik told Maricopa County Superior Court Judge John Hannah.

Altogether, Cyber Ninjas reported a net loss of more than $2 million from the audit.\n\nThe audit, released in September, found that Biden got 360 more votes in Maricopa County than initially reported out of 2.1 million ballots cast.

Attorneys for the company argued that such demands can be made only of what are traditionally considered public officials and agencies.\n\nBut Hannah, in a sometimes strongly worded decision, said that’s just not how the law works in Arizona.\n\nCyber Ninjas, hired by Senate President Karen Fann to review the 2020 election results in Maricopa County, has the opportunity to seek an appeal. Hannah, however, said prior decisions by the Court of Appeals support his ruling.\n\nThe ruling potentially paves the way for individuals to file demands for production of documents from other private companies on the premise that they are holding public records.\n\nThat point did not go unnoticed by Jack Wilenchik, an attorney for Cyber Ninjas.\n\n“If Cyber Ninjas is compelled to respond directly to records requests by any member of the public, on penalty of being sued if it does not do so promptly, then it will create an unforeseen and legally groundless administrative burden on every state contractor and employee,” he argued.\n\nAt issue are tens of thousands of documents, emails, texts and other communications that Cyber Ninjas has not yet produced in response to a public records request by Phoenix Newspapers, parent company of The Arizona Republic. That is even after Hannah told the company that the records it has related to the audit are public, ordered it to preserve the records, and then, after the Supreme Court ruled in a parallel case, disclose them within three days.\n\nThat three days was up this past week.\n\nInstead, Wilenchik filed pleadings saying there is “zero legal authority” to order Cyber Ninjas to respond directly to a public records request. And, if nothing else, he argued that forcing the company to respond to the public denies the Senate, to which he said the records really belong, the ability to decide “the timing, manner, and form of the production of its own public records.”\n\nHannah, however, said that ignores a couple of facts.\n\n“Under the unique circumstances of this case the Ninjas are a ‘public officer’ within the plain meaning of the public records law,” he wrote.\n\nHe said “officer” means any person appointed to hold any office of a public body along with a chief administrative officer, head, director, superintendent of chairman of any public body. And “public body” means any public organization or agency supported with state funds or spending state dollars.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n“The Ninjas have been ‘appointed’ by the Senate as the ‘head’ of the ‘public organization’ conducting what the Ninjas describe as an ‘ongoing investigation of how Maricopa County conducted the 2020 election,”’ the judge wrote.\n\nThe Senate is at least partly funding the audit with public money, “which makes the organization a ‘public body’ for purposes of the statute,” he added.\n\nAnd since Arizona law defines “corporations” as “persons,” that makes the company and “officer” — along with the Senate — responsible for maintaining and disclosing public records, the judge said.\n\n“It follows that Phoenix Newspapers may file an action against the Ninjas … appealing the denial of PNI’s request for audit-related public records,” Hannah said.\n\nThe judge also said Cyber Ninjas is a “custodian” of public records.\n\n“The relevant provision (of the public records law) expressly commands persons seeking public records to direct their request to the ‘custodian’ of the records,” Hannah said.\n\n“In the event of a denial, the requesting party has a judicial remedy through a special action like this one,” Hannah said.\n\nThe judge also rejected a bid by Cyber Ninjas to be dismissed entirely from the case.\n\nThat would leave the Republic suing only the Senate for records that the Senate’s own attorney says it does not have because they are in the hands of Cyber Ninjas. Hannah noted that the Senate’s right to demand those records from its contractor “has been a subject of debate throughout this case.”\n\nThe judge said it is settled law that the public records law makes the courts, and not the Legislature, the final arbiters of this public records dispute.\n\n“If the Ninjas are beyond the courts’ authority, the Senate will effectively remain in a position to decide which of the records in the Ninjas’ possession are public records — precisely where (the Court of Appeals) says the Senate should not be,” Hannah wrote. He said that so far, “the Senate has not been inclined to disclose audit-related records to the public on any terms other than its own.”\n\nHannah stressed that his order still allows the Senate to seek to withhold specific records based on exceptions to the public records law such as attorney-client privilege.\n\n“But procedural problems created by multiple record holders are not a reason to compromise the public’s right to know what its government is up to,” he said.\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

Rand Paul was an opportunity for the GOP to, in a moment echoing one of the McCarthy era’s most notorious hearings ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s foremost experts on infectious diseases, has at long last reached the end of his rope. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was hectoring him in a congressional hearing, when he said, “You are the lead architect responsible from the government, and now 800,000 people have died.”\n\nAs Fauci began his response, stressing masks and vaccines for the umpteenth time, Paul interrupted, “and you have advocated to make it coercive and done by force, and you’ve advocated it be done by mandate.”\n\nRising to high moral dudgeon, Paul resorted to sarcasm: “You have advocated that your infallible opinion be dictated by law.”\n\nFauci had had enough. He put Paul’s attacks into context – and the context is dark.\n\n“I have threats upon my life,” he said. “Harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.” Fauci then got into specifics, and they are chilling: “Just about three or four weeks ago, on December 21, a person was arrested who was on their way from Sacramento to Washington, DC at a speed stop in Iowa. And the police asked him where he was going. And he was going to Washington, DC to kill Dr. Fauci. And they found in his car an AR-15 and multiple magazines of ammunition, because he thinks that maybe I’m killing people.”\n\nNow we know the threat of physical violence is real. The Capitol itself was the scene of a violent and vicious attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot and grievously wounded by a gunman in 2017, and Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head at point blank range in 2011 by a man who murdered a federal judge and five others in the attack.\n\nBut Fauci took it one step further on Wednesday, offering a theory behind Paul’s attacks. He displayed screen shots he said were from one of Paul’s political websites, seeking to raise campaign donations from his attacks on Fauci.\n\nHaving been through more political song and dance than I care to recall, I think I can spot insincerity. Fauci’s response, I believe, was real. It was raw. And it was righteous.\n\nFauci is not infallible, but he is a dedicated public servant who has spent his long career trying to protect Americans from illness and death. He deserves tough questions, to be sure, and even criticism where warranted. But at a time when national security officials warn that, “We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists,” Paul seems to have crossed a line.\n\nThe fact the Rand Paul for Senate committee is raising money on a website called firefauci.org suggests that politics, rather than public health, might be part of the motivation of the junior senator from Kentucky.\n\nThe Senate has always had demagogues, liars and outliers who go too far. Fauci’s measured but heartfelt takedown should have been a Joseph Welch moment. Welch was the lawyer for the US Army when the notorious Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin was spreading hysterical chargers that communists had infiltrated the army, along with the State Department, Treasury and even the White House.\n\nWhen McCarthy impugned a young lawyer from Welch’s firm, the soft-spoken, bespectacled Welch could take it no more. “Until this moment, senator,” he said, “I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” McCarthy was stunned into silence, as Welch continued, “Have you no sense of decency?”\n\nWelch’s response broke the fever. Six months later, McCarthy was formally censured by his Senate colleagues 67-22. Half of the Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn their fellow Republican.\n\nNot now. Paul’s rant against Fauci produced a strong and immediate condemnation from Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “Thank you, first of all, for what you do,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to put your life at risk…. And thank you for calling out this agenda for what it is: an attempt to score political points, to build a political power base around the denial of science and around personal attacks on you and your family.”\n\nBut where was the GOP condemnation of Paul? Nearly nonexistent.\n\nTo his credit, though, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah defended Fauci. “Some of what we do [in these hearings] is performing,” he said, in an apparent reference to Paul’s attack. “And some of what we do is to become informed.”\n\nHe went on to stress his appreciation for Fauci and the other scientists who were testifying. “I do want to point out how much I personally, and I believe the great majority of the people of our country respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do. You are scientists, not politicians. Nevertheless, you are being made subject to the political whims of various political individuals, and that comes at a high cost.”\n\nTwo cheers for Romney for defending Fauci and for labeling the attacks on him as political. But I do wish he had followed through and condemned his GOP colleague the way Republicans condemned McCarthy decades ago. Perhaps that’s too much to ask in these hyper-partisan times.\n\nPerhaps Romney has assessed that condemning Paul might have opposite effect of the censure of McCarthy; that if he were to condemn Paul the result would be a diminution of Romney’s political strength within the Trumpified GOP, while strengthening Paul even more.\n\nThat is a depressing thought, but likely accurate. So long as there is money to be raised, clicks to be earned, votes to be gained, we can expect power-hungry politicians to, well, be reckless and dangerous – even during a deadly pandemic. It seems that political decency is not as contagious as Omicron.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fauci-rand-paul-senate-hearing-claims/', 'Headline': 'Fauci derides Rand Paul in Senate hearing as COVID cases ... - CBS News', 'Snippet': ""Fauci fires back at Rand Paul during heated exchange 02:40.

We’re going to learn about it. I promise you that,” Paul warned Fauci.\n\nThe duo has been known to trade barbs in the past, but Fauci appeared more serene and unfazed than he has in past showdowns in which he had been visibly riled by his Senate nemesis. The exchange occurred during a hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\nDuring the barrage of questions, Paul also hammered Fauci’s position on immunology, playing an edited clip of Fauci advising someone in a 2004 C-SPAN interview that they did not need to receive a flu shot. Paul used the clip to insinuate Fauci contradicted his position on COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHowever, as Fauci and a Reuter’s fact check noted, the clip featured Fauci discussing the flu vaccine with someone who described having a reaction to it — Fauci was not voicing opposition to the vaccine for the general public.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nFauci announced last month that he will depart from his role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and as the chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden by the end of the year.

The two often spoke over one another. Fauci accused Paul of attacking him to gain political points with swaths of people who have lost faith in the federal government’s handling of the pandemic.\n\n“Dr. Fauci, the idea that a government official like yourself would claim [that you] unilaterally represent science and that any criticism of you is criticism of science itself is quite dangerous,” Paul began. “Central planning, whether it be of the economy or of science, is risky because of the fallibility of the planner.”\n\nA testy Fauci blasted back, accusing Paul of politicizing the deadly virus.\n\n“You accuse me of, in a monolithic way, telling people what they need to do. Everything that I’ve said has been in support of the CDC guidelines: Wear a mask, get boosted,” Fauci said. “So I would like to make something clear to the committee. He’s doing this for political reasons.”\n\nFauci also cited threats made against his life and the lives of his family members, which Paul countered with examples of his own life being threatened over pandemic politics. Paul was also present at the 2017 baseball field shooting in Virginia when 24 Republicans practicing for a charity game were targeted by an attacker with a gun. This resulted in a shootout between the gunman and the Capitol Police. Senate Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was shot and had to undergo surgery.\n\n“It’s disappointing for you to suggest that people who dare to question you are responsible somehow for violent threats. Realize that by attacking me, you’re attacking the one member who actually has suffered from violent attacks,” Paul said. “We had over 160 rounds of semi-automatic weapons fired at us. … So for you to somehow suggest that somehow I or people who dare to oppose you are responsible for a threat, that’s insulting.”\n\nPaul and Fauci have engaged in such back-and-forth in past hearings to examine the administration’s response to COVID-19, which has a death toll approaching 840,000, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.\n\nFOUR HIGH-PROFILE DOCTORS WHO ARE CHALLENGING THE COVID-19 RESPONSE\n\nPaul also accused Fauci of refusing to acknowledge dissenting views about mitigation measures, including lockdowns.\n\nPaul cited support from the scientific community for the Great Barrington Declaration, an online petition written by three epidemiologists from Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of Oxford. The scientists who supported the declaration, now numbering above 910,000, decried early lockdown policies as being too broad to do any good for the concentrated communities most vulnerable to the virus, such as the elderly. Fauci and Collins were found to have called for a “devastating published takedown of its premises” after a Freedom of Information Act request exposed emails between them.\n\nPaul added: “A planner who believes he is the science leads to an arrogance that justifies in his mind using government resources to smear and to destroy the reputations of other scientists who disagree with them.”\n\nFauci, who held up a photo of a webpage from Paul’s site soliciting donations and calling for Fauci to be fired, said at the hearing that Paul was engaging in personal attacks against him and risking his safety.\n\n“We are here at a committee to look at a virus now that has killed almost 900,000 people, and the purpose of the committee was to try and get things out, how we can help to … the American public, and you keep coming back to personal attacks on me that have absolutely no relevance to reality,” Fauci said.\n\nUS BREAKS RECORDS ON COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATIONS AND CASES\n\nFauci and Paul most recently clashed in a November hearing, when Paul pressed Fauci on a theory that the virus was created in and escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was performing a risky type of research on pathogens called “gain of function.” Some gain-of-function research, conducted on existing pathogens, has raised concerns over the potential to enhance the pathogenicity or transmissibility of the virus. Fauci has maintained that the virus most likely arose in nature after mutating and replicating in animals before infecting humans.\n\n“It makes me very uncomfortable to have to say something, but he is egregiously incorrect in what he says,” Fauci said of Paul.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/06/17/fauci-rand-paul-covid-boosters-children-mxp-sot-vpx.hln', 'Headline': '‘Are you gonna let me answer a question?’: Fauci and Paul face off in ...', 'Snippet': 'During a Senate committee hearing on the ongoing federal response to the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci faced questions from Sen.

Roger Marshall, were ad hominems, which does nothing but distract from what we really need to be doing,” he said.\n\nIn response to the hearing, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN in a statement Tuesday that Republicans on the panel “clearly weren’t trying to stop the spread” of misinformation.\n\n“At a time when America is seeing rising COVID cases, it’s disappointing and frankly unacceptable that Republican Senators chose to spend a hearing with the country’s leading public health experts spreading conspiracy theories and lies about Dr. Fauci, rather than how we protect people from COVID-19,” spokesman Ian Sams said.\n\n“The Biden Administration will continue to focus on getting more Americans vaccinated and boosted and helping Americans get access to the tools to keep themselves and others safe. We would encourage these Republicans to join us.”\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s about three times last winter’s peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to Johns Hopkins.\n\n“Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody,” Fauci told J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, on Tuesday.\n\n“Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”'}}",92.22222222222223,2

In April 2020, after then-US-president Donald Trump hinted that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a WIV laboratory, the NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant. Its goal was to study how coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, jump from bats to humans. A few months later, the NIH reinstated and immediately suspended the award until certain conditions were met that, at the time, EcoHealth said were impossible to complete.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature applaud the renewal, adding that this type of research is essential to avert the next pandemic. They claim that the NIH’s termination and subsequent suspension were politically motivated, and that, although long overdue, this renewal ends — for now — a drama-filled exchange between the agency and EcoHealth.\n\n“It’s about goddam time,” says Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, who organized researchers to push back against EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020. “The integrity of science requires a barrier against political interference,” he says.\n\nThe NIH “routinely considers processes and measures for strengthening [its] oversight over federal funds” and has been working with EcoHealth to strengthen its “administrative processes to meet NIH’s expectations”, says Amanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Washington DC.\n\nLengthy list of conditions\n\nAlthough the organization will now be able to continue its bat coronavirus research for the first time since the saga began, the NIH placed an extensive list of restrictions on the four-year, US$2.9-million award. None of the researchers who spoke to Nature had ever seen a grant with so many stipulations.\n\nAmong other things, EcoHealth is specifically forbidden from performing any in-country research in China, including with the WIV, or collecting any new samples from vertebrates — such as bats. The revised grant also mandates greater scrutiny of EcoHealth’s finances and accounting practices, driven in part by a federal watchdog report, released in January, finding that EcoHealth had misreported about $90,000 in expenses. The report also faulted the NIH for improperly terminating EcoHealth’s grant.\n\nFurthermore, EcoHealth will be forbidden from performing any work that is deemed by the NIH’s parent organization, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to have the potential to enhance the virulence or transmission of a virus. This restriction stems, in part, from criticism that research done at the WIV and funded by an EcoHealth subaward qualified as ‘gain of function’ research.\n\nDisputed research\n\nCongressional Republicans have alleged that this research, which involved attaching spike proteins from wild bat coronaviruses to an unrelated virus to determine whether the wild pathogens could infect human airway cells, should have undergone HHS review. Anthony Fauci, then-director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the agency concluded that these experiments did not meet the bar to undergo such review, and noted that the WIV did not intend to enhance the viruses.\n\nTens of thousands of people exposed to bat coronaviruses each year\n\nVirologists say this type of research is essential for developing vaccines and therapeutics against emerging pathogens and for understanding how likely a pathogen is to spark a pandemic. The NIH and HHS have been finalizing guidance that will probably tighten the oversight of such research in the United States.\n\n“I don’t know if any other single grantee from NIH has been subjected to this level of oversight,” says Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance. Yet he is “positive and optimistic” about the grant restart, despite all the restrictions. A key priority for the newly released funds will be analysing nearly 300 partial or complete genomes of SARS-related coronaviruses from samples that the organization collected before the funding halt, he says.\n\nThird rail of virology\n\nThese restrictions seem reasonable, in light of the enormous public attention to and scrutiny of gain-of-function research, says Lawrence Gostin, a health-law and policy specialist at Georgetown University in Washington DC. Still, Gostin says he is surprised the agency restarted its funding for EcoHealth, given that it has been the “third rail of politics” the past few years.\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, says she is pleasantly surprised to see the grant renewed, but worries about the “terrible precedent” that the NIH set by “arbitrarily” terminating an award on the basis of “unfounded rumours” regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2. She hopes that these same restrictions will not apply to other scientists doing similar work, but is encouraged by the number of research groups that are now studying coronaviruses following the COVID-19 pandemic.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/politics/biden-admin-suspends-wuhan-lab-funding/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden administration suspends funding for Wuhan lab', 'Snippet': 'The Biden administration has suspended funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology following a monthslong review that determined that the Chinese research institute “is not compliant with ...', 'Full_text': 'The Biden administration has suspended funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology following a monthslong review that determined that the Chinese research institute “is not compliant with federal regulations and is not presently responsible,” according to a memo from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHHS, which conducted the review, also proposed barring the Wuhan Institute from doing business with the federal government going forward, according to the memo, which is dated to Monday and was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe lab has not received any federal funding from the US National Institutes of Health since July 2020, according to an HHS spokesperson.\n\nThe determination came after the research institute failed to provide the National Institutes of Health with requested documents amid reported safety concerns at the lab.\n\n“This action aims to ensure that WIV does not receive another dollar of federal funding,” an HHS spokesperson said in a statement. “The move was undertaken due to WIV’s failure to provide documentation on WIV’s research requested by NIH related to concerns that WIV violated NIH’s biosafety protocols.”\n\nIn Monday’s memorandum, HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for acquisition concludes that the Wuhan Institute’s “disregard of the NIH’s requests” and the NIH’s conclusion that the institute’s research likely violated biosafety protocols present a risk that the institute “not only previously violated, but is currently violating, and will continue to violate, protocols of the NIH on biosafety.”\n\n“Therefore, I have determined that the immediate suspension of WIV is necessary to mitigate any potential public health risk,” the official, whose name is redacted, writes in the memo.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology is at the center of a theory that Covid-19 escaped from the lab in late 2019, triggering the global pandemic and nearly 7 million recorded deaths. The virus was first identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report last month that stated the US intelligence community could not determine whether researchers at the lab who fell ill in the fall of 2019 were infected with Covid-19, but identified safety and security issues at the lab. Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-suspends-federal-funding-wuhan-lab-over-non-compliance-2023-07-19/', 'Headline': 'US suspends federal funding to Wuhan lab over non-compliance', 'Snippet': 'WIV has not received federal funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. medical research agency, since July 2020, according to an HHS statement on Wednesday.', 'Full_text': ''}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/us-government-bans-wuhan-lab-from-federal-funding/4017756.article', 'Headline': 'US government bans Wuhan lab from federal funding', 'Snippet': 'The WIV research in question, originally awarded funding by the NIH in 2014 and renewed in 2019, was channelled through the New York-based non-profit EcoHealth Alliance.

This latest development exacerbates the drama surrounding the US government’s support of coronavirus research in China prior to the outbreak.\n\nThe WIV research in question, originally awarded funding by the NIH in 2014 and renewed in 2019, was channelled through the New York-based non-profit EcoHealth Alliance. EcoHealth received approximately $600,000 (£467,000) for the project, which involved studying coronaviruses in bats and their potential to jump into humans. The project, which was cancelled in April 2020, was originally funded by the Obama administration. It had come under public attack from Republican politicians in the weeks preceding its termination.\n\nHHS does not argue that the project caused the Covid-19 outbreak, but it does criticise WIV for refusing to share certain information relating to its research.\n\nThe HHS memo, recently released by an oversight committee of the US House of Representatives, noted that the NIH determined in an August 2021 review that the WIV research may have yielded an increase in viral activity that violated the terms of the NIH grant. There was no evidence that EcoHealth had notified the NIH about this possibility as it was required to do, according to HHS.\n\n‘NIH has given WIV several opportunities to disprove this finding, but WIV has failed to do so,’ HHS stated. ‘Due to WIV’s disregard of the NIH’s requests … the NIH’s conclusion that WIV research likely violated protocols of the NIH regarding biosafety is undisputed.’\n\nEcoHealth contends that any increase in viral activity was ‘not statistically significant’, and argues that it had reported the results of its experiments in line with NIH’s requirements.\n\nIn a statement to Chemistry World, EcoHealth says that: ‘The [HHS] claim that there was no evidence that EHA notified NIH about the experiment in question is not correct. EcoHealth Alliance provided the Government Accountability Office with documentation regarding this alleged late reporting that showed the experimental results were first reported in the Year 4 report, which was submitted into the NIH system on time in April 2018, with a copy emailed to the NIAID Program Officer at that time.’\n\nEcoHealth had described the goal of the NIH-funded project as constructing Mers and Mers-like chimeric coronaviruses in order to understand the potential origins of Mers in bats.\n\nWhen NIH abruptly terminated the WIV research in 2020, there was worry that political pressure had motivated the decision. At the time, 77 US Nobel laureates and more than 30 scientific societies including the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology expressed concerns about the decision.

While NIH pursues long-term actions for award recipients, it has not conducted its own near-term assessments, which could enhance its internal oversight.\n\nWhy GAO Did This Study\n\nFederal agencies sometimes provide funds to foreign entities, such as universities and laboratories, for research or other purposes. Such collaborations can benefit agency missions and lead to advancements in areas such as public health. At the same time, Congress, the White House, and others have expressed concerns about entities from countries, such as China, exploiting U.S. funded research in ways that could harm U.S. national security or economic competitiveness.\n\nGAO was asked to provide information on federal funds disbursed to three selected Chinese entities—Wuhan University; the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.\n\nThis report examines, among other things, the amount of federal funding GAO identified that was provided to the three selected Chinese entities in calendar years 2014 through 2021 and steps agencies and award recipients have taken to assess risks.\n\nGAO searched USAspending.gov and other federal databases and reviewed award agreements, progress reports, payment information, and other documents from federal agencies and U.S.-based award recipients.

This led many people to suspect that the virus could have leaked.\n\nIn the months before the pandemic, the institute had registered patents for repairs to ventilation symptoms and broken seals and is believed to have worked on viruses at inappropriate biosafety levels.\n\nThe Chinese authorities have refused to allow a proper investigation and have blocked attempts to access laboratories, research notebooks or sample databases.\n\nThe memo said that the US National Institutes of Health had been trying to contact WIV for two years for information about the experiments but had received no response.\n\nThe HHS warned that such experiments may still be ongoing and could have had “potential health consequences and repercussions”.\n\n“WIV conducted an experiment that violated the terms of the grant regarding viral activity, which possibly did lead or could lead to health issues or other unacceptable outcomes,” said the notice of debarment.\n\n“WIV has not acknowledged the violations, has not cooperated with the government to address the violations, has not accepted responsibility for the violations, and therefore presumably has taken no action to eliminate the risk to the government in conducting business transactions with WIV presently or into the future.”\n\nIt concluded: “There is risk that WIV not only previously violated, but is currently violating, and will continue to violate, protocols of the National Institutes of Health on biosafety.”\n\nNo response from ‘bat woman’\n\nThe HHS said it had tried to contact WIV by fax and email for further details on the experiments but had received no response.\n\nThe department tried to contact Dr Shi Zhengli, the principal investigator known as “bat woman”, and Dr Yanyi Wang, laboratory director-general, but neither replied.\n\nOfficials even sent the notice of debarment by DHL Express, asking whether WIV wanted to contest the ruling, but the envelope was returned to sender.\n\nThe worrying experiments came to light in a progress report compiled by US-based EcoHealth Alliance, which had subcontracted WIV to carry out laboratory work on bat coronaviruses gathered in south-east Asia.\n\nEcoHealth received NIH funding worth more than $3.7 million (£2.9 million) between 2014 and 2020 for the project, of which more than $600,000 (£490,000) went to the Wuhan laboratory.\n\nAt the time of the experiments, the US had recently lifted a three-year ban on science that increased the potency of viruses.

These are funds that a primary grant recipient can give to a collaborator to perform research on their behalf. The biomedical funder’s policy, set to go into effect on 1 October, specifies that foreign subaward recipients, in particular, will be subject to extra scrutiny.\n\nForeign collaborators will have to provide copies of all relevant laboratory notebooks, data and documentation to the primary recipient every few months. The NIH also reserves the right to request access to this supporting documentation as part of its oversight responsibilities.\n\nNIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research\n\nThe NIH’s dealings with foreign researchers have drawn attention as debate rages over whether the COVID-19 pandemic started with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 passing from animals to humans or from a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China, which is located in the city where early cases were detected.\n\nThe non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, based in New York City, has been especially scrutinized. It had received NIH funds to study coronaviruses, and the WIV received a subaward on this grant to study bat coronaviruses in the wild and their potential to infect people. Part of this work involved creating hybrid bat coronaviruses, which some critics have decried as risky ‘gain of function’ research. (On the basis of EcoHealth’s grant application, the NIH determined that this study didn’t meet the bar for risky research.)\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature worry that the change to the NIH’s subawards policy will have a chilling effect on international collaborations; foreign researchers might forgo partnerships because of the requirements. They also say that scientists will have to spend an unreasonable amount of time on administrative tasks to comply with the policy.\n\nThe policy is “heavy handed” and disrespectful to international collaborators, says Sheela Shenoi, an infectious-disease physician at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “It suggests that international collaborators need additional oversight — that they don’t have capacity to do their own research in a rigorous and robust way.”\n\nAmanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, responds that this provision “empowers primary recipients to obtain, on a regular basis, records and data from foreign subrecipients without having to worry that they will not be able to access materials when needed”. She adds: “As part of high-quality science, there should be a free flow of information, documents and data.”\n\nUnder fire\n\nThe NIH has come under fire from federal auditors for, among other things, its handling of the EcoHealth grant. When it first funded EcoHealth, the NIH instructed the organization to report any evidence of unexpected transmissibility or virulence of the hybrid viruses. A progress report from EcoHealth was two years late owing to a miscommunication and a technical glitch, the organization has said. Federal auditors have criticized the NIH for not pursuing the late report and recommended that the agency intensify its monitoring of foreign subaward recipients.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nThe NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant in 2020, but then said it would reinstate it if EcoHealth could meet certain conditions, including obtaining the WIV’s lab notebooks. In part because EcoHealth was unable to do so, last August the NIH terminated the subaward altogether.\n\nPeter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, responds that oversight of federally funded research is important, but that the subaward policy might have unintended consequences that are counter to its mission. “This might lead to countries cutting collaborative ties with US scientists, rather than handing over their laboratory notebooks,” he says. “This would weaken America’s pandemic preparedness at the very time when we need to be developing partnerships in regions where the next pandemic is most likely to originate.”\n\nConcerns voiced\n\nResearchers have condemned the policy’s focus on foreign subrecipients. Stefano Bertuzzi, chief executive of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington DC, says he supports extra accountability and oversight for subawards, but he is “puzzled by why only foreign entities are singled out”.\n\nA virologist from Brazil, who requested anonymity out of fear that their chances of receiving funding could be harmed, says the policy adds a layer of bureaucracy, crafted with politics — not science — in mind.\n\n‘Heinous!’: Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions\n\nIn addition to concerns about international partnerships, Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, says that the policy imposes an administrative burden without providing more funding to meet the requirements. Keusch organized researchers to protest EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020.\n\nFor some researchers, this isn’t a trivial matter. Oleksandr Zeziulin, a specialist in drug abuse and mental health at the Ukrainian Institute on Public Health Policy in Kyiv, says that, because of Russia’s invasion last year, Ukraine has been struggling with constant power outages. “During the winter, we were struggling with our normal schedule, and we’re expecting the same next winter, given Russia’s attacks on power plants,” says Zeziulin, who is a subrecipient of a grant with Shenoi. “If this policy will require an extra 10% of our time, I think it’s going to be [difficult], given the situation we’re in.”\n\nNot all researchers think the policy is unreasonable, however. David Relman, a microbiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, says it addresses concerns that “US expectations and standards for research reproducibility and transparency may not be shared elsewhere in the world”. But he has concerns that it might discourage international collaborations and worries that it’s unclear which elements of lab notebooks would need to be shared. He calls on the NIH to clarify this provision and to clearly communicate to the research community the motivations and goals of the policy.\n\nThe ambiguity could mean that the policy will face legal challenges in some countries, says the Brazilian virologist. Many researchers work on several overlapping research projects from various funders, and some countries carefully safeguard data — for instance, biodiversity data in Brazil — that will be difficult to keep separate.\n\nThe agency is accepting comments on the policy until 26 June, but it’s unclear whether it will make revisions based on feedback.

In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\n\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\n\nDeaths are falling in many areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries.\n\nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases.\n\nUsing this metric, researchers from the Lancet medical journal suggest that more than 18 million people may have died because of Covid up to the end of 2021. That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.\n\nSeparate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.\n\nWho has vaccinated the most?\n\nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs.\n\nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\n\nAccording to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.\n\nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine.\n\nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people.\n\nWhere are cases still high?\n\nDaily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.\n\nStudies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious.\n\nAsia\n\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.\n\nNorth Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic ""fever cases"" according to the state news agency.\n\nChina appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.\n\nIn Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations.\n\nIt marked the most significant moment so far in the country\'s slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.\n\nEurope\n\nReported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.\n\nIn the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing.\n\nNorth America\n\nThe US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world.\n\nHowever, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic.\n\nLatin America\n\nLatin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.\n\nMexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.\n\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world\'s second-highest official death toll.\n\nIn Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world\'s highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.\n\nAfrica\n\nAfrica has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\n\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths.\n\nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.\n\nMiddle East\n\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.\n\nThe official death toll in Iran, the region\'s worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases.\n\nNeighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.\n\nIn January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country.\n\nOceania\n\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year.\n\nSo far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.\n\nDaily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.\n\nIn early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years.\n\nHow did coronavirus spread?\n\nAbout this data\n\nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\n\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\n\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country\'s elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\n\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Figures for France are for the mainland only and include both suspected and confirmed cases.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/30/world/covid-cases-omicron.html', 'Headline': 'See Where Virus Cases Are Rising Fastest - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'Similarly, some of the European countries currently facing serious surges have among the world’s highest vaccination rates. In Portugal, where 88 percent of the population is fully vaccinated ...', 'Full_text': 'As the Omicron variant sweeps across the planet, the global tally of new coronavirus cases has for the first time passed one million per day on average. The previous global case record set last April has already been broken three times this week.\n\nThe United States, Canada and much of Western Europe are leading the surge, with both regions seeing record-breaking levels of new coronavirus cases. The daily average number of new cases in the United States on Tuesday was more than 267,000, exceeding the previous all-time peak set in January; Wednesday’s average was higher still, at more than 300,000.\n\nNew cases in at least 11 European countries — Britain, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain and Switzerland — also passed their previous all-time peaks on Tuesday or Wednesday. In France, the daily case average passed 100,000.\n\nCases in Canada have also seen a steep increase in recent days, more than doubling in a week to an average of more than 25,000. And Australia’s cases climbed to an average of more than 12,600 on Wednesday — eight times as high as just three weeks earlier.\n\nAs dramatic as these case counts are, they are also likely an undercount because of asymptomatic cases, reporting lags due to the holiday season, lack of test availability in many places and at-home tests whose results may not be reported.\n\nIn the United States, where Omicron is spreading quickly, 16 states and Puerto Rico are at their all-time case records. These include states with comparatively high vaccination rates: Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island, all of which are at least 70 percent fully vaccinated. In addition to being more transmissible generally, Omicron also appears to give rise to more breakthrough infections.\n\nSimilarly, some of the European countries currently facing serious surges have among the world’s highest vaccination rates. In Portugal, where 88 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, cases are up more than 200 percent in the past two weeks. Spain, where new cases have more than quintupled in the past three weeks, is 80 percent fully vaccinated.\n\nSo far, overall hospitalization and death rates have not come close to reaching previous peak levels, though some places are struggling. About 78,000 people in the United States are hospitalized with the virus, compared with over 130,000 at the height of last winter’s peak. The average daily rate of deaths across much of the world also remains lower than the record rates seen earlier in the pandemic.\n\nA combination of immunity from vaccines, booster shots and previous infections is most likely at least partially responsible for lower hospitalization and mortality. Encouraging early data also suggests the Omicron variant may be less virulent than previous strains of the virus.\n\nThe recent surges in all these places, however, have been fast and steep, and severe outcomes usually lag case spikes by at least a few weeks, so hospitalizations and death rates may rise in the coming days.\n\n“This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse and again disrupting lives and livelihoods,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said at a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nCase rates in South America, Asia and much of Africa have so far remained relatively low. And at least some countries that saw record case loads this month may be turning a corner. In southern Africa, where scientists first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization, cases remain higher than on the rest of the continent but appear to be abating.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. health officials continued to stress the importance of vaccination and booster doses. In a White House news briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that people eligible for a booster shot who have not yet gotten one “do have some protection against severe disease and death,” though she added that “they do have quite a bit of waning with regard to protection against infection.”\n\nThat group with waning immunity comprises those who completed a Moderna or Pfizer two-dose series six months ago or more, or received a Johnson & Johnson shot at least two months ago.\n\nAlthough Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, discouraged large New Year’s Eve parties, his advice in the news conference Wednesday was more measured when it came to small gatherings of vaccinated people.\n\n“Although the risk is never zero in anything, the risk is low enough that we feel you should continue to go through with those plans of having a home-related, vaccinated, boosted gathering with family and close friends who are also vaccinated and boosted,” he said.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html', 'Headline': 'Covid World Vaccination Tracker - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'More than 5.55 billion people worldwide have received a Covid-19 vaccine, equal to about 72.3 percent of the world population. ...

This map shows the stark gap between vaccination programs in different countries.\n\nThe data is compiled from government sources by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. A vaccinated person refers to someone who has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and a fully vaccinated person has received either a single-dose vaccine or both doses of a two-dose vaccine, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots.\n\nMany countries started to administer additional doses toward the end of 2021 after research found that vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. More than 2.72 billion additional doses have been administered worldwide. Additional doses include booster doses given to fully vaccinated individuals when the protection from the original shots has begun to decline, as well as extra shots given to people, such as the immunocompromised, who did not have a strong immune response from their initial doses.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the manufacturers of two of the most widely used Covid-19 vaccinations, have developed updated vaccines that more effectively protect against the newer Omicron variant. These are currently being administered in many countries, including the United States and Britain.\n\nVaccination rates around the world have stagnated in recent months, with public demand dropping even as vaccine supply has become more abundant.\n\nEarly leads in vaccination rates have become entrenched. Africa has the lowest vaccination rate of any continent, with just 37.2 percent of the population receiving at least one dose of a vaccine, compared to 82.3 percent in Latin America.\n\nMore than two-dozen different vaccines have been used worldwide, according to data from Our World in Data.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/01/14/1072188527/for-the-36-countries-with-the-lowest-vaccination-rates-supply-isnt-the-only-issu', 'Headline': 'Interactive map shows global COVID vaccination rates. 36 nations are ...', 'Snippet': 'Interactive map shows global COVID vaccination rates. 36 nations are under 10% : Goats and Soda Even as wealthy countries hit 80% vaccination rates, a number of countries have not even vaccinated ...', 'Full_text': 'In the United States and many other wealthy countries, you can get a free COVID vaccine at supermarkets, pharmacies and clinics.\n\nIn other countries, it\'s a very different story.\n\n""The vaccine is not available in the North (of Yemen),"" says Jasmin Lavoie with the Norwegian Refugee Council, who\'s based in the northern city of Sana\'a. ""If a person wanted to be vaccinated, that person would have to go to the south. So drive around 15 to 20 hours crossing front lines in the mountains."" Even then, after such a treacherous journey through a war zone, it\'s not clear if doses would be available. Like many low-income countries, Yemen has struggled to get hold of vaccine.\n\nLoading...\n\n""Yemen has been one of the places with the lowest vaccination rates in the world,"" says Lavoie. ""And that\'s despite the fact that we\'ve experienced three waves of COVID."" Currently fewer than 2% of Yemenis are fully vaccinated.\n\nYemen is one of 36 countries that fall below the 10% immunization threshold, some with rates under 2%. Much of the mid-section of Africa is in that category, including powerful economic and political players like Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nBy contrast, many wealthy countries have fully vaccinated more than 80% of their citizens.\n\nWhy Africa lags so far behind\n\nMaaza Seyoum with the African Alliance, a South Africa-based advocacy group, says there are many factors playing in to the low vaccination rates in many countries on the continent but the biggest issue is simply that African nations have struggled to get doses.\n\n""Initially, 100 percent, I would say the problem was a lack of access (to vaccines) and a global system that did not prioritize African countries,"" Maaza says. Wealthy nations bought up far more pharmaceutical firms vaccine production than they could even use. The WHO-backed COVAX program faltered as it relied heavily on voluntary donations and on manufacturers in India who were blocked from exporting doses when COVID case numbers skyrocketed on the sub-continent. Some African countries managed to get supplies from China but Beijing often prioritized donations to wealthier trading partners.\n\nThat situation has changed, says Maaza. Recently vaccine deliveries to Africa have increased. But now there are new problems: the shipments are haphazard and sometimes consist of less popular brands that are about to expire.\n\n""Now we\'re seeing the sort of drip, drip, drip of vaccines,"" she says. ""People are waiting for vaccines to come. They come, then they stop.""\n\nThis unpredictable supply chain, she says, makes it nearly impossible for African countries to plan nationwide vaccination drives. And in some of these places where hardly anyone has gotten the jab, rumors about the mysterious vaccine have flourished and augmented vaccine hesitancy.\n\n""The truth is, there is vaccine hesitancy everywhere,"" Maaza says. ""But as people are waiting, it leaves kind of a fertile ground for these rumors to circulate.""\n\nWhich makes convincing people to come to a clinic and get immunized even more of a challenge.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhat\'s behind those under 10% vaccination numbers\n\nThe World Health Organization set a goal of trying to push all countries to 40% vaccine coverage by the end of 2021. The 36 countries still under 10% obviously didn\'t even get close. Kate O\'Brien, the director of immunization and vaccines for the World Health Organization, says this is a significant problem.\n\n""For countries that are struggling to get even above 10%, what this means is that health-care workers are not fully vaccinated yet,"" she says. ""It means older age populations, those who have underlying medical conditions, the people at highest risk are not fully protected yet.""\n\nShe acknowledges vaccine supply inequity as a major part of why rates are so low in these three dozen countries but says there are other reasons too. Many of these countries had health systems that were struggling even before the pandemic to meet local medical needs. Some of them have needed to upgrade refrigeration systems to be able to store certain mRNA vaccines at extremely low temperatures. Others need syringes. All of this takes money that many low-income nations health ministries may not have.\n\n""A COVID vaccine campaign does require funding,"" O\'Brien says. Countries need money ""to deploy new health workers and to assure that the clinics have the resources that they need.""\n\nAnd while there has been some international assistance to lower-income nations to help, that financing has also at times been haphazard and unpredictable.\n\nOngoing conflicts present another obstacle\n\nAway from Africa, the other nations that haven\'t yet gotten above 10% COVID vaccine coverage are some of the most troubled in the world, including Yemen as well as Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti.\n\nCurrently the armed conflict has displaced 4 million of 30 million Yemenis from their homes. Various groups control different parts of the country. According to the U.N. more than 2/3rds of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance. Yet international aid agencies have struggled to meet those needs and keep their operations running in the country due to the ongoing insecurity and a lack of funding.\n\nFor most people in Yemen, life is incredibly difficult. COVID vaccinations are ""not on the top of the list of priorities for many people in Yemen,"" Jasmin Lavoie with NRC says. He says most Yemenis spend their days trying to find food, shelter, decent toilets and worrying about whether they\'ll have to flee fighting once again. ""These are reasons why people are not getting vaccinated too,"" he adds.\n\nThere are similar issues in other conflict zones. ""In a place like Afghanistan, in a place like Syria, COVID is not their number one priority,"" says Paul Spiegel, who runs the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSpiegel returned to Baltimore from working in Afghanistan in mid-December. ""[Vaccination] campaigns are happening,"" he says but adds that the immunization drives are constrained by the limited shipments of vaccine. ""A fair bit of it is Johnson and Johnson, which makes a lot of sense in Afghanistan situation because it\'s just one dose,"" he notes.\n\nBut similar to Yemen, the social upheaval in Afghanistan, with the U.S. departing and the Taliban returning to power, has pushed COVID to the backburner. Vaccine drives are not a top priority for the Taliban, even though it has said it supports vaccination drives by COVAX and the U.N.\n\nNor is it a priority among Afghans. ""Right now there\'s such a dire humanitarian situation there,"" he says. ""[Afghans] are worried about getting food on the table, they\'re worried about feeding their kids. And so COVID is not a priority for the average person.""'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51235105', 'Headline': 'Covid map: Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country', 'Snippet': 'Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 550 million confirmed cases and more than six million deaths reported across almost 200 countries.', 'Full_text': 'The true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\n\nDeaths are falling in many areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries.\n\nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases.\n\nUsing this metric, researchers from the Lancet medical journal suggest that more than 18 million people may have died because of Covid up to the end of 2021.

As of 15 June 2022, 37 COVID-19 vaccines were in Phase 3 clinical trials, authorized for early use or approved for full use (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html), with some available for use in infants as young as 6 months old1,2. Eleven vaccines have now been given Emergency Use Listing (EUL) from the World Health Organization (WHO)3, and more than 11.9 billion (as of 15 June 2022, https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL) COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered worldwide4,5,6. Nonetheless, more than 30% of the world population remains unvaccinated3, and COVID-19 vaccines and public health measures to promote them have generated substantial political controversy in many countries7.\n\nGiven that vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases will continue to play a critical role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and future diseases, there is an enormous need to better understand both how governments use vaccines and the factors that drive or inhibit uptake. Within the latter, the policies and measures that governments adopt to promote vaccination play an important role. This resource article introduces a new dataset from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) project8 that provides cross-national and longitudinal information on COVID-19 vaccination policies across the world. The new dataset covers vaccine prioritization policies (V1), vaccine availability and eligibility by group (V2), whether there is a cost to individual recipients at the point of use (V3) and mandate policies (V4) (Table 1). Developed in consultation with governments, policymakers, stakeholders in the field and the OxCGRT expert advisory board, this dataset allows researchers and policymakers to systematically compare government vaccination strategies and assess distributional capabilities (see Methods for more information on dataset design). Through combination with other datasets, further analyses, such as on the impact of distribution policies on uptake, are made possible.\n\nThe dataset is composed of four indicators that report national-level COVID-19 vaccination policies for 52 population categories from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022 for 185 jurisdictions in the national database, as well as subnational jurisdictions (provinces) for Canada and (states) for the United States (subnational-jurisdiction data for other countries are in development and will be added to the online data repository as they become available). Collected by a specially trained team of OxCGRT volunteer data contributors, the dataset has been reviewed for quality assurance and accuracy by core OxCGRT researchers and a specially trained review team. The results presented here focus only on the national-level data. The 52 population categories include general and at-risk age groups (in 5-yr intervals for individuals over 16 yr), occupational categories (based on exposure and transmission risk and economic function—groups of people working in occupations critical to the economic function of the country, including essential workers and airport/border staff) and medical categories (based on vulnerability) (Table 2). These closely reflect the categories listed in the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) values framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, a framework that guides the allocation of vaccinations under limited supply to specific population groups to meet specific outcomes.\n\nHere we present some variations and temporal patterns of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization, eligibility, distribution, cost and mandates by group, with the aim of illustrating how the new dataset can offer insights for researchers and policymakers. By mapping variation in vaccination policies over time, this dataset provides a means of responding to critical questions about the role of vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic. The four indicators are presented in the dataset alongside vaccination rates so that users can easily generate cross-national and within-country comparisons to explore associations between vaccination policies, those prioritized for vaccination and vaccine uptake. The dataset’s jurisdiction–day format purposefully facilitates merging with other data sources. For example, combining these four vaccine policy indicators with data about other kinds of pandemic policies—relating to closures, economic support and health, such as testing—allows for assessment of the interplay of vaccination programmes within the broader context of pandemic management. Combining these data with other social science indicators broadens the possibilities further, towards considerations of the impacts of vaccination policies in different economic, political, cultural or religious contexts, and how controversies towards COVID-19 vaccines may have shaped policy. Comparisons between countries with similar demographics, or those with unique demographics and geography might highlight best practice for future pandemics10.\n\nTo motivate use of this new dataset, in this section we illustrate some initial observations using the four vaccine policy indicators. First, we focus on the first two indicators (V1 and V2). We note common patterns in vaccination prioritization strategies according to the broader strategies guiding countries’ pandemic management, and by country income level. We then observe country-level variation in both prioritization and actual distribution by age group and other kinds of vulnerability categories. Second, we consider the additional two indicators (V3 and V4), briefly discussing the cost of vaccination to individuals, before exploring vaccine mandate policies. Although we find limited variation relating to cost across countries—almost all countries provided the vaccine to people free of charge—we detail the diversity of countries’ vaccine mandate policies, ranging from non-existent, to policies specific to certain age groups, occupation groups and populations carrying out specific religious activities, or working in named locations.\n\nComparing countries’ prioritization plans\n\nThe vaccine prioritization (V1) indicator captures the order in which governments planned to deploy COVID-19 vaccines to different categories of people. It depicts the published plans of all countries in the OxCGRT dataset (only Eritrea, of 185 countries, has yet to begin COVID-19 vaccinations or publish a vaccination plan). These plans were primarily used to ration limited supplies at a time when global vaccine supply was constrained. As such, they help reveal the evolving priorities governments held for vaccine deployment.\n\nBroadly, we can distinguish two ideal typical COVID-19 strategies: elimination and mitigation. Roughly, studies have categorized these strategies by observing how eliminators aimed to keep the virus out of the country and to prevent community transmission. In contrast, mitigators sought to reduce the impact of community transmission by flattening the curve and reducing cases and deaths11,12,13,14. Many countries in the WHO West Pacific Region adopted policies closer to the elimination model, perhaps in part due to the region’s previous experience with SARS11,13. Relatedly, it has also been hypothesized that island nations may have been more likely to pursue elimination models during COVID-19 due to their geographical advantage of isolation and ability to seal national borders, although for many low-income countries (LICs) and LMICs, this came at appreciable economic cost11,15,16,17,18. Finally, early responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have also highlighted distinctions between mitigation and elimination strategies based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, such as high-performing surveillance systems with early and targeted contact tracing and widespread efficient testing in eliminator countries12,14.\n\nInterestingly, we observe a clear distinction in the vaccination rollout strategies of countries that have been characterized as pursuing an elimination strategy throughout much of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to countries that pursued a mitigation strategy11,12,13,14,19. Table 3 highlights how nine selected eliminators (selected as examples from a comprehensive list of eliminators, see Supplementary Table 3), such as Australia and New Zealand, prioritized frontline workers and border staff alongside clinically vulnerable people (those with co-morbidities and/or predispositions to illness) in their first rounds of vaccination (that is, positioned rank 1), while nine selected mitigators (see Supplementary Table 3 for comprehensive list of mitigators) focused instead on vaccinating only clinically vulnerable and elderly populations, along with healthcare workers. Looking across all countries in our dataset, while 11 out of 19 (58%) Western Pacific countries prioritized first-round vaccinations on the basis of economic function, only 42 out of 164 (26%) non-Western Pacific countries did so. When looking at the OECD subset, we observe the same pattern: 2 out of 5 countries that adopted elimination in the early stages of the pandemic (40%) prioritized vaccination on the basis of economic function versus 4 out of 32 (12%) mitigators. Finally, the same descriptive pattern holds for island nations (16 out of 32, 50%) when contrasted to non-island nations, with 16 (50%) island countries adopting economic function prioritized vaccination versus non-island countries (38 out of 151, 25%). In contrast, only 3 Western Pacific countries (16%) prioritized clinically vulnerable people, versus 80 (49%) for countries outside the region. However, we observe no differences in descriptive patterns for either OECD or island country groupings. While 3 out of 5 OECD countries that adopted elimination strategies in the early stages of the pandemic (60%) prioritized clinically vulnerable people, 19 out of 32 mitigators did so. Finally, 44% of island (14 out of 32) and 46% of non-island countries (70 out of 151) prioritized clinically vulnerable people.\n\nWhen we map country differences in the most- (or equal-most-) prioritized categories of people (Fig. 1), we observe that almost all countries in our dataset placed healthcare workers among the first to receive COVID-19 vaccines (91% of countries, or 168/185) presumably both to reduce transmission and mitigate health impacts for those at high risk of exposure. Following healthcare workers, 54% (101) of countries also prioritized populations deemed to be clinically vulnerable. Seventy-four countries (40%) prioritized groups of people critical to the economic function of the country, 45 prioritized (24%) categories related to the public function of the country, and 27 countries (15%) focused on educators and/or students for COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nComparing countries’ plans with actual distribution\n\nBy the end of 2021, 62 (34%) countries had published COVID-19 vaccination rollout plans and prioritization lists, often with rough estimates for the timing of each phase. Of those, 48 countries began vaccination before the end of 2021 (Fig. 2), and by 31 March 2021, 107 more countries had published their COVID-19 vaccination plans and priorities. In countries with access to vaccines, deployment swiftly followed plans (captured by indicator V2, which records the groups actually receiving a vaccine in a country). Because vaccine access was highly related to countries’ income levels20, Fig. 2 groups countries according to the World Bank income classification groups for 2021 (https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html). HICs were the first to publish vaccination plans to secure COVID-19 vaccines and to begin administration of vaccines for their populations, reflecting their greater ability to produce and purchase vaccines. Figure 2 shows that the publication of plans and subsequent administration of vaccine doses then followed in upper middle-income countries (UMICs), LMICs and then LICs, respectively. HICs moved quicker to expand vaccination eligibility to the 12+ yr age group than LMICs. It also shows that despite publishing plans and beginning vaccinations at later dates than HICs and UMICs, some LMICs and LICs quickly moved from prioritized vaccinations by age or occupation to universal access (defined in our dataset as being available widely to all those over the age of 16+ yr or 18+ yr, with age floor dependent on vaccine brand). LMICs and LICs have had far fewer vaccine doses available to them than HICs and UMICs (https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/accessibility/), so one possible explanation for the swift movement towards universal access in LICs and LMICs may be an attempt to vaccinate larger proportions of their populations in the face of vaccine hesitancy. However, there are conflicting views on whether LMICs and LICs are more or less vaccine hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccines than HICs and UMICs21,22,23. Another possible explanation for the quick move to (ostensibly) universal access (despite low vaccine supply) may have been to reduce public perception of favouring or excluding certain groups in the face of a public health emergency and with varying social and geographic challenges in the distribution of vaccines24,25.\n\nComparing categories by age and vulnerability status\n\nOnly 11 countries in our dataset did not specifically prioritize elderly populations (the age cut-off for ‘elderly’ is defined locally, see Methods) in their plans and rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Macau, Namibia, Russia, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Uruguay, Zimbabwe and Taiwan). Long-term care facilities (LTCFs; nursing homes, elderly care homes and so on) are a concept and cultural phenomenon predominantly found in some relatively wealthy countries26. This is reflected in our data (Fig. 3), with most African, South Asian and Middle East countries not prioritizing LTCFs in their plans and rollouts. In contrast, while not prioritizing its elderly population in general, Russia did prioritize vaccinations at LTCFs for elderly people before moving to universal eligibility.\n\nAt the younger end of the age scale, children and infants were not included in initial COVID-19 prioritization plans and indeed, the WHO stated that children were a lower priority group as they are less likely to experience serious symptoms27. Clinical research into the safety and efficacy of vaccines in children came later28. Because clinical trials split children into groups of young children (~5–11 yr,) and adolescents (~12–17 yr)29, many countries’ regulatory agencies approved COVID-19 vaccines for children in similar age groups at around the same time as research emerged and as vaccine supplies allowed (Fig. 2). Children 12 and above first became eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations on 6 May 2021 in the territory of Nunavut, Canada, and Bahrain made the COVID-19 vaccine available to children aged 3+ yr on 17 August 2021. As of 15 June 2022, only 12 countries were vaccinating infants (children aged 0–4 yr), 6 being Central and South American countries (Fig. 3), and 26 countries in our dataset have not been recorded as vaccinating children or infants (ages 0–15 yr).\n\nCountries prioritized many professional categories, some of which (for example, healthcare workers) were gendered to varying extents in different countries. Pregnant people were first made eligible for vaccinations in 2021. They were not initially prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination due to a lack of clinical trial data on the effect on unborn children and pregnant people. From January 2020 to 15 June 2022, 21 countries explicitly prioritized pregnant people in their official vaccination rollout plans (V1) (Fig. 4), and 54 out of 185 countries reported specifically administering vaccinations to pregnant people during their vaccination rollouts (V2).\n\nSimilarly, strikingly few countries have prioritized refugees, migrants and ethnic minorities in their COVID-19 vaccination plans or actual rollouts (Fig. 4), despite reports of disparities in the risk of COVID-19 infections and in health outcomes among these groups30,31,32,33,34. Australia, Brazil, Canada and New Zealand all prioritized Indigenous populations in their plans and administration of COVID-19 vaccines (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, Indigenous People, traditional riverine and quilombola communities in Brazil, First Nations in Canada, Māori and Pacific People and their extended families/whanau that care for them in New Zealand). In early June 2021, Greece began a vaccination programme specifically for refugees starting with the island refugee camps, then moving to the mainland camps. Some African countries with high rates of internal migration have prioritized the vaccination of migrants and ‘travellers’ (a term sometimes used for migrants) (Fig. 4)(https://africacenter.org/spotlight/african-migration-trends-to-watch-in-2022/). Many other countries may have made COVID-19 vaccines available to refugees and migrants but may not have explicitly noted this in official documentation.\n\nVaccine cost and mandates\n\nThe dataset reveals that nearly all countries provided the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge to individuals at the point of delivery (V3). From data freely available online from government sources, we observed that Botswana, India, Pakistan and Turkmenistan required a small fee for COVID-19 vaccination from individuals, in some circumstances. In Taiwan, vaccines were free for those meeting eligibility criteria, but individuals could self-fund vaccination in advance of becoming eligible for free vaccines. Some countries enabled individuals to acquire the vaccination privately if they wished or encouraged vaccine tourism in efforts to boost tourism during the pandemic. In late 2021, Russian tourists were accessing free non-Sputnik vaccines in Croatia via specially arranged tours35. Not long after, Russia began to offer their Sputnik COVID-19 vaccine at a cost to tourists (although visas to visit the country were an issue for some)36. Cities and states of the United States, Indonesia, Cuba, the Maldives and the UAE began to use free COVID-19 vaccinations to increase tourism, and travel agencies in the United Kingdom, India and the United States (among others) offered package deals for individuals not yet eligible in their own country to access the vaccine in another37,38,39. These cases are not recorded in our V3 ordinal indicator data but are captured in qualitative coding notes within the dataset.\n\nWe define mandatory COVID-19 vaccination as a government policy requirement to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to work in a specific occupation, or for a specific age group of citizens to be vaccinated. We see these policies as distinct from COVID-19 passports or certification to gain entry to non-essential services or for international travel based on demonstrating immunity or negative test results. These ‘passport’ style policies are defined in the OxCGRT database as ‘differentiated policies’ and are part of the OxCGRT Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) dataset8,40. For 10 of these original indicators, we report two policies, one for vaccinated and another for non-vaccinated individuals, viewing requirements to present passes as a de facto closure (see online documentation and Methods for further detail).\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine mandates (V4) were first introduced in Jakarta, Indonesia, in February 2021 for all adults41. As of 15 June 2022, 55 countries (29%) of our dataset have currently, or had at one time, at least one vaccine mandate policy. Figure 5 shows that mandatory vaccination policies accelerated in implementation around July 2021, commonly according to occupation (83%), with age-based mandates being far less widespread (17%).\n\nThe most common groups to have been mandated for COVID-19 vaccination were related to occupation: government officials (36), healthcare workers (29), staff at LTCFs (15) and educators (22). Hence, in most countries, mandates only affected a small and specific proportion of the population, as opposed to COVID-19 passports which affected the whole population to control their access to services. Six countries (Germany, Ethiopia, Kuwait, New Zealand, Russia and Tonga) mandated vaccines for socially vulnerable and or other vulnerable populations (see Table 2). Nine countries, including Indonesia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan mandated COVID-19 vaccination for the entire adult population. Ecuador mandated vaccination for all those over 5 yr and in Costa Rica, all those aged 3–18 yr must be vaccinated (""×"" symbol in Fig. 5). The qualitative notes section of this new vaccine dataset records how some countries introduced specific vaccine mandates for particular groups relevant to their local context, such as those observing the Hajj in Saudi Arabia, Jahh in Bangladesh, and maritime and port workers in Singapore.\n\nIn this section we describe the design, structure, collection, publication and review of the panel dataset of COVID-19 vaccine policies, with the jurisdiction–day as the unit of analysis. All OxCGRT data are available on GitHub and are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution CC BY standard. Data users should refer to the project website for updated documentation and methodologies (https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker). Excel (v.16), Stata (v.17.0) and R (v.4.1.3) software were used for all analysis and images produced in this resource article.\n\nIndicators\n\nIn late 2020, the OxCGRT team began to consider the COVID-19 vaccine policies and strategies that might be deployed globally. Extensive consultations with government officials, policymakers, experts and stakeholders in the relevant fields, consideration of critical gaps in existing data at the time, and capacity to collect such information resulted in a focus on four priority policies to measure (vaccine indicators V1–V4): who was prioritized for vaccines, who was eligible and receiving vaccines and in what order, who was paying for vaccines, and who was mandated to be vaccinated. Additional indicators for future consideration could include which vaccines were approved/deployed in each country, prioritization for additional/booster vaccinations, vaccine dose timing (manufacturer recommendations vs timeline chosen by country for subsequent doses), government vaccination incentives, vaccination education strategies/programmes and internal vs external funding for vaccines.\n\nVaccine prioritization (V1) records the ranked position for different groups within a country’s prioritization plan. This is the official plan of the official order in which categories are to be vaccinated. This is recorded regardless of whether a country has capacity to distribute and administer vaccines. Vaccination eligibility/availability (V2) is a categorical/binary variable that records which categories of people, regardless of their position in a prioritized rollout plan, are currently receiving vaccinations. This is recorded as a non-zero value if there is evidence that people in this category are being vaccinated, whether this is happening in a targeted geographical region or nationwide. There must be de facto evidence that this is happening to record a non-zero value in V2. For ‘elderly’ groups, we used local elderly age definitions using qualitative notes where available. In the absence of local guidance on elderly age range, a default of 65+ yr was used. Vaccine financial support (V3) is recorded on an ordinal scale. It reports how vaccines are funded for each category selected in V2 as currently receiving vaccination (1 for full cost to individual, 2 for partially funded by government, 3 for fully funded by government/free). Mandatory vaccination (V4) is a binary variable which reports the existence of a requirement for a category of people to be vaccinated. These are government policy requirements to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to work in a specific occupation, or for a specific group to be vaccinated. This is a mandatory vaccination required as part of occupation or citizenship, and we do not record policies that only ‘encourage’ voluntary vaccination to access non-essential services, facilities or freedoms. For example, if healthcare workers must be vaccinated to attend their place of work, this is recorded in V4. As detailed in our interpretation guidance, if there is a vaccine mandate in place for workers of certain occupations, and non-vaccinated people in this occupation have the option of testing regularly to opt out of vaccination, we still record this as a mandate in V4. If vaccination is mandatory in a subnational region as a result of an official national or local government policy, we record this in V4. We do not report enforcement of vaccine mandates, just the policy.\n\nThe vaccination policy dataset also contains summary indicators. These use an ordinal scale to report one number per indicator to offer a succinct summary on the basis of data entered for variables in the main V1–V4 dataset. These are summarized in our codebook (see Supplementary Information). V2, V3 and V4 policies are reported as non-zero values on the date when the policy came into effect, as opposed to the date they were announced. We report the V1 government rollout prioritization plan on the date the policy was published. For the analysis in this paper, the detailed qualitative notes section was used to manually find specific age floors for when different ages became eligible for vaccination, rather than using the age ranges in the quantitative data due to the limitations described above.\n\nIn March 2022, the OxCGRT NPI dataset and data structure was altered to reflect the different policies for unvaccinated and vaccinated people (for COVID-19), where passes or proof of either negative testing or vaccination were required to access different areas of public life (https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-scratchpad/tree/master/differentiated_vaccination_policies). For ten indicators (C1–8, H6 and H8), both the policy values for non-vaccinated and vaccinated people are reported if there are different policies in place. If there is no differentiation, one value is reported. These differentiated values relate only to ‘voluntary access’ to elements of public life, such as attending large events or entertainment and dining venues, which are controlled by testing, evidence of previous immunity or vaccination status through a form of certification or proof.\n\nIt is valuable to record both mandatory vaccine policies and voluntary vaccine pass/passport policies. This differentiated coding is reported in our NPI dataset with ‘V’ and ‘NV’ designations (for example, ‘C1V_School closing’ and C1NV_School closing’) and is distinct from the ‘V4 - mandatory vaccination’ indicator reported in this paper.\n\nData collection\n\nWe collected and published data on publicly available sources, which are freely available through internet searches. These are found on government websites, policy briefs and reputable news outlets. The best-quality sources are original policy documents and high-quality media outlets. These sources are codified into the OxCGRT data protocol and entered into the database. A detailed qualitative note (written in English) and web-archived source are provided for context.\n\nThe V1–V4 data for the national dataset were initially collected by OxCGRT researchers and a small group of experienced and specially trained volunteer data collectors who received specific training. As of 1 January 2022, data collection for V1–V4 was integrated into the core OxCGRT data collection process, which involves an international team of hundreds of volunteer data collectors covering 90+ unique languages. Where language was a barrier, and where English sources could not be found, local speakers from the pool of OxCGRT contributors were consulted, or translation tools such as Google Translate were utilized. The majority of data collectors are/were postgraduate students at universities around the world. Each data collector completed a bespoke online e-learning course, which took around 45 min to complete, covering the V1–V4 indicators, key coding interpretation points and data quality. Every week of data collection was reviewed by a member of the OxCGRT team for quality and accuracy, and was further reviewed by a trained V1–V4 specific volunteer reviewer (also trained via a bespoke reviewer training e-learning course) and confirmed in the database over the medium to longer term. On GitHub, we published both a codebook and an interpretation guide to standardize interpretation and ensure that all coders were making the same logical choices for data entry. We also published a ‘best fit’ table which records where categories have been substituted when there is a category announced in a policy that is not listed in V1/2, ensuring the standardization of ‘best fit’ interpretation (Supplementary Table 4). This highlights the importance of the ‘notes’ function for each indicator, enabling an in-depth qualitative analysis of the data beyond the numerical summaries. Qualitative notes in our comma-separated values files (CSVs) can be used to find archived original policy documents and specific groups prioritized in each country if a best fit has been used.\n\nData publication and summary indicators\n\nThe data are published in a standalone ‘Vaccines_full.csv’ on GitHub, which includes all the 52 categories for V1–V4. They are also summarized in 9 summary indicators, which report one single number for V1 (vaccination prioritization), V2 (vaccination eligibility/availability) categories (overall summary, general population age floor, at-risk age floor, medically clinically vulnerable (non-elderly), education, frontline workers (non-healthcare), frontline workers (healthcare)) and V3. These summary indicators are included in most of our data CSVs on GitHub, including the NPI dataset ‘OxCGRT_nat_latest.csv’. The data are published in real time and updated each week by the team of international data collectors.\n\nIndependent data quality check\n\nWe conducted a data quality and accuracy check, where two core team researchers checked the data and original source material for 100 randomly selected data entry points, focusing on the period of time when the majority of new policies and policy changes were being made, and during which the majority of data were entered for all four vaccination policy indicators. The researchers independently verified that 90% of the original data entries in the database were correct, by analysing original source material and checking this alongside the database entries. The remaining 10 entries were corrected. Specifics such as date of announcement vs date of policy effect, accuracy of selected groups and ages, and ensuring that any recorded mandates were in fact government mandates were among the various checks in this independent data quality review process.\n\nAs part of the weekly data update cycle, a small team of specially trained reviewers are tasked with checking and confirming data entered. As part of this review process, changes to the data are made retroactively, meaning values on past dates may change. As a result, we recommend downloading the most recent data and stating the download date when using them for analysis. The data used for this paper up to 15 June 2022 have been checked thoroughly by the authors. On the rare occasion where data could not be verified or confirmed by local sources, or via translation, they were not included. An unintentional consequence of this is that a group that was prioritized/eligible/mandated to receive a COVID-19 vaccine may not have been captured by our dataset.\n\nComparison to other data sources\n\nWe do not know of any other datasets publishing systematic data on COVID-19 vaccine policies. This unique source therefore adds considerable value to other datasets. For example, the Reuters COVID-19 vaccination tracker, although no longer updating data, reported the prioritization plan (similar to V1 - vaccine prioritization), availability and eligibility (similar to V2 - vaccination eligibility/availability) of different groups for vaccination in each country, although this does not provide the original archived source material, dates or a time series dataset to evidence when groups became eligible (https://www.reuters.com/graphics/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/). The Africa CDC Vaccine Dashboard also reports the date vaccination campaign commenced (similar to V2) in African nations, although it does not provide original archived source material, or state when which groups began to receive vaccines (https://africacdc.org/covid-19-vaccination/). Coronanet includes questions on the number of priority groups for vaccine distribution (similar to V1) but only through 2021 (https://www.coronanet-project.org/assets/CoronaNet_Codebook.pdf).\n\nVaccine policy data are particularly useful when combined with information on the number of vaccine doses administered. For example, the OxCGRT vaccine policy data are displayed as part of Our World in Data’s COVID-19 vaccinations website resource3, which combines country-specific vaccination data into a single resource. Our data can be compared to variables such as proportion of the population that has received one dose, vaccination uptake rates and number of doses administered, to consider the effects of vaccination policies on these. Our H7 indicator, which is a summary of our V2 vaccination policy indicator, is also displayed here. The data are also used by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and WHO’s Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity (https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/), demonstrating their value in informing an interactive accessible tool to reflect the data on the COVID-19 rollout to ensure equitable access.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://theconversation.com/covid-why-the-current-surge-in-cases-is-a-problem-for-some-countries-but-not-others-179716', 'Headline': 'COVID: why the current surge in cases is a problem for some countries ...', 'Snippet': 'In comparison, countries that followed a zero COVID strategy are now seeing a larger surge in infections and deaths as they open up, even if they have high vaccine coverage.', 'Full_text': 'Just when it looked like COVID cases were starting to fall after the high peaks of January, infections are rising once again around the world. The main driver of this latest surge is the more infectious BA.2 sub-lineage of the omicron variant, which has been becoming more common ever since Christmas.\n\nIn the UK, increased social mixing and waning vaccine effectiveness – even in those who have had a booster dose – are contributing to this rise. But we’re also seeing huge spikes in areas that had previously kept themselves fairly COVID-free – New Zealand, Hong Kong and South Korea, for example.\n\nCase rates in these places are currently outstripping those seen in many European countries when they were at their worst, despite these newly struggling countries tending to follow rigorous zero COVID policies, with tight border controls and strict internal measures to limit infections. The highly infectious new variant having a bigger effect in places where restrictions are tighter. But why?\n\nZero cases equals delayed cases\n\nLong before COVID, it was known that non-pharmaceutical control measures – whether within a country or at its border – rarely stop a pandemic spreading. Usually, these things – lockdowns, quarantines and so on – only delay a disease’s spread. However, this may be sufficient to flatten the curve of infections and ease pressure on health services, or to reduce illness and death by delaying most infections until treatments have improved or vaccines become available.\n\nIn reality, the most influential disease-control factor is immunity, which can be generated by infection or vaccination. Both are important. As I pointed out last summer, the end of the pandemic in any country will likely depend on the proportion of people who have already had a COVID infection, and not just the proportion vaccinated.\n\nBreakthrough infections in those who are vaccinated will drive their immunity to a higher level, while in the unvaccinated an infection provides a level of protection that would otherwise have been absent. In fact, immunity following an infection now gives rather better protection against being infected in the future than immunity from a booster vaccine, especially once 90 days have passed since being vaccinated.\n\nThis helps to explain why some countries are now handling outbreaks better than others. In the UK, despite excellent vaccination coverage, the majority of people have also now caught COVID, and many people have caught COVID more than once. Cases are high for sure, but not as high as in some of these Pacific countries, and rates of death and severe disease are remaining at a relatively low level.\n\nIn comparison, countries that followed a zero COVID strategy are now seeing a larger surge in infections and deaths as they open up, even if they have high vaccine coverage. Their lack of prior infections means immunity across the population is lower.\n\nVaccines still making a difference\n\nBut despite the fact that both Hong Kong and New Zealand have both suffered huge rises in viral transmission recently, the impact on public health in the two places has been dramatically different.\n\nNew Zealand, with high vaccine coverage and a recent booster programme, is weathering this surge with far fewer deaths so far. Hong Kong has seen many more deaths, with a death rate per million people in the four weeks up to March 18 2022 that’s 38 times as great as in New Zealand.\n\nThe difference is down to the vaccination campaigns in these two places. In Hong Kong, at least up to the end of February, the uptake of the booster vaccine was much lower than in New Zealand, and was particularly low in older, more vulnerable age groups. Even second-dose coverage was low in these groups, meaning plenty were at a high risk of severe disease and death.\n\nDid the UK get it right?\n\nMy own country, the UK, decided to lift its remaining restrictions earlier this year, even though cases were still high when controls were eased and remain high now. Was this the right thing to do?\n\nThere’s no right answer, but given that non-pharmaceutical control measures only delay infections rather than prevent them, such measures should only continue if the benefits of delaying infections outweigh the more general harms to society and human health that come with restricting people’s freedoms. Given the high levels of immunity across the British population that have resulted from high case levels and good vaccine coverage, lifting controls made sense.\n\nThere’s also another important point to consider here. It’s been well publicised that the vaccines’ protective effect against catching the virus and developing symptoms wanes more quickly than protection against severe disease and death. However, there’s emerging evidence (still in preprint, so awaiting review by other scientists) that protection against severe disease also wanes with time.\n\nWhat this means is that delaying infections could result in people getting COVID at a later date when they are more susceptible to getting badly ill. This was predicted in some of the disease modelling of omicron published at the end of last year (also still in preprint). Imposing additional restrictions in December 2021 would have reduced COVID deaths in January 2022, but at the cost of increased deaths in March.\n\nPersonally, I would have preferred to wait till the end of March to lift restrictions, so that we were into spring, when respiratory viruses spread less rapidly. That could have reduced the current NHS pressures stemming from staff absences.\n\nAnd finally, even though lifting controls made sense, today the UK still has a population of older or clinically vulnerable people who have not yet had the virus and whose vaccine immunity is waning. We must focus now on preventing these people from developing severe disease – perhaps through further vaccine boosters or use of antiviral drugs – rather than on attempting to reduce transmission in the general population.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a2901ce8-5eb7-4633-b89c-cbdf5b386938', 'Headline': 'Coronavirus tracker: the latest figures as countries fight the Covid-19 ...', 'Snippet': 'However, the surge in Europe since the autumn means Covid-19 remains a global pandemic.

From mid-April, focus shifted to the US, where the number of deaths has remained consistently high, although the focus of the epidemic has shifted from the northeast to other regions of the country. Latin America became the epicentre of the pandemic in the summer of 2020, with the region accounting for almost a half of deaths each day. However, the surge in Europe since the autumn means Covid-19 remains a global pandemic.\n\nWith several vaccines approved for use, the race is now on for countries to vaccinate their populations:\n\nThere are concerns, however, that reported Covid-19 deaths are not capturing the true impact of coronavirus on mortality around the world. The FT has gathered and analysed data on excess mortality — the numbers of deaths over and above the historical average — across the globe, and has found that numbers of deaths in some countries are more than 50 per cent higher than usual. In many countries, these excess deaths exceed reported numbers of Covid-19 deaths by large margins.\n\nThere are several different ways of comparing excess deaths figures between countries. In absolute numbers, more people than would usually be expected have died in the in the US than in any of the other countries for which recent all-cause mortality data is available.\n\nAdjusting for typical mortality rates, the five hardest hit countries worldwide where data is available are all in Latin America. Peru has seen more than double the number of deaths it sees in a typical year, and neighbouring Ecuador has seen a 67 per cent increase. Nicaragua (a 59 per cent rise), Bolivia (56) and Mexico (55) complete the top five.\n\nReporting, data analysis and graphics by Steven Bernard, David Blood, John Burn-Murdoch, Oliver Elliott, Max Harlow, Joanna S Kao, William Rohde Madsen, Caroline Nevitt, Alan Smith, Martin Stabe, Cale Tilford and Aleksandra Wisniewska.

Hospitalizations and deaths have not seen a similar increase in pace, but these are lagging indicators that may drag weeks behind case increases.\n\nThe seven-day average of new deaths is currently 1,453, according to data from JHU, and 76,779 people are hospitalized in the US with Covid-19, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nNote: This seven-day average is an in-progress data point and not yet the final number for Dec. 28, 2021. This number may rise as the day ends.\n\nSeveral European countries report record high daily new Covid-19 infections as Omicron continues to spread\n\nSeveral European countries — such as France, the UK, Italy, and Portugal — are currently seeing a large increase in daily new cases, many even setting new records since the pandemic began as the Omicron variant continues to spread. Despite the rising trend in daily cases, those figures haven’t translated into more deaths and hospitalizations, particularly when compared to the same period a year ago.\n\nFrance reported a record high of 179,807 new confirmed coronavirus cases in a 24-hour period on Tuesday, setting the highest number since the start of the pandemic, the French health authorities said.\n\nThe latest data shattered the previous record of 104,611 new daily cases, which was set on Saturday.\n\nThe increase in daily figures is a huge increment of 176,847 new cases when compared to last year’s figures, yet despite a rise in hospitalizations and ICU occupancy, France latest data is showing less deaths.\n\nFrench authorities’ data shows that in the last 24 hours, France recorded 290 coronavirus related deaths, 484 people hospitalized and 83 people in ICU beds.\n\nA year ago, the country recorded 363 deaths, 25 hospitalizations and 44 people under intensive care.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK has also set a new daily record of Covid-19 cases with 129,471, according to British government data released Tuesday.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, Portugal has also recorded the highest number of new daily cases since the start of the pandemic, with a total of 17,172 new coronavirus cases, the Portuguese Health Ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nThe highest count of daily infections took place on Jan. 28, with 16,432 cases reported at the time.\n\nLooking back at last year’s figures, the latest data shows a large increase of 15,079 new daily cases, however, despite the rise in cases, Portugal is showing a lower number on deaths, hospital admissions and ICU occupancy.\n\nThe data shows that currently, Portugal has 936 people hospitalized, with 152 of them in intensive care and 19 deaths, whereas a year ago Portugal was recording 2,967 hospitalizations, with 503 of them in ICU units and a total of 58 deaths.\n\nItaly is seeing a similar situation, with the country also reporting their highest daily new cases since the start of the pandemic with 78,313 people infected in the last 24 hours, according to the country’s Health Ministry data.\n\nThe latest figures show that the trend of rising cases continues after the country reported recently new daily case records for three consecutive days.\n\nDespite the rise in daily cases, Italy has recorded lower figures in hospitalizations and deaths when compared with data from a year ago.\n\nOn Dec. 28, 2020, Italy recorded 8,585 new infections, 445 Covid-19 related deaths and 2,565 ICU beds occupied, which reveals a significant contrast to the most recent numbers of 78,313 new infections, 202 deaths and 1,145 ICU occupancy.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that France’s ICU occupancy and hospitalizations are down in comparison with last year. The country’s latest data shows only deaths are down in comparison.\n\nCovid-19 hospitalizations rise 25% in England in one week\n\nCovid-19 hospitalizations in England have risen by 25% over the course of one week as the country continues to grapple with the Omicron variant.\n\nThe latest data from the UK government dashboard showed an additional 1,374 hospital admissions in England on Tuesday. This represents a 25% increase compared with the Dec. 21 figure of 1,098.\n\nThere are currently 9,546 people in hospital with Covid-19 in the country.\n\nThis comes as England set a new daily record for Covid-19 cases on Tuesday when 129,471 cases were reported.\n\nThe UK’s public health agency, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has warned there may be “temporary pauses” in ordering or receiving home testing kits as authorities try to cope with the “exceptional demand.”\n\nThe agency has ramped up delivery capacity since Dec. 18, delivering 900,000 test kits daily. They encouraged people to revisit the UK government site “every few hours” to try get tests, urging them to make sure they are using “any tests they already have at home before ordering or collecting more.”\n\nSince Dec. 12, fully vaccinated close contacts of a positive Covid-19 case in England have been advised to take lateral flow tests for seven days, causing a huge spike in demand for LFTs in the country.\n\nHopes of New Year’s Eve celebrations were kept alive on Monday when the UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced that no further restrictions would be imposed in England before Dec. 31.\n\nUK Care Minister Gillian Keegan advised people on Tuesday to “be cautious,” take a lateral flow test before heading out to New Year’s celebrations and seek out “ventilated spaces.”\n\nBiden issues proclamation revoking southern Africa travel restrictions\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a presidential proclamation on Tuesday revoking a proclamation put in place last month that enacted travel restrictions on eight southern African nations, including; South Africa, as the Omicron variant began to spread.\n\nCNN had previously reported Biden’s intent to lift the restrictions.\n\nThe travel restrictions had come under fire across the globe, described by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as “travel apartheid.”\n\nBiden administration officials repeatedly defended the move as an action to give the US more time to understand the variant and its spread.\n\nTuesday’s proclamation noted that scientists have determined that people vaccinated against Covid-19 “are protected against severe disease and hospitalization from the Omicron variant.”\n\nIt also said that the variant is now in over 100 countries and is “prevalent” in the US, where cases have been rising for weeks. It said that “substantial progress” has been made in understanding the Omicron variant.\n\nThe previous proclamation will be lifted at 12:01 am EST on Dec. 31.\n\nCovid-19 vaccines help prevent breakthrough infections even in immune-compromised people, study shows\n\nCovid-19 vaccines help prevent breakthrough infections even among immune-compromised people such as organ transplant recipients and rheumatoid arthritis patients, researchers reported Tuesday.\n\nBut these patients are at higher risk of breakthroughs than other vaccinated people and should take extra precautions, the researchers reported.\n\nDr. Jing Sun, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and colleagues studied the records of 660,000 people who received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine through Sept. 16.\n\n“Overall, the incidence rate for COVID-19 breakthrough infection was 5.0 per 1,000 person-months among fully vaccinated persons but was higher after the Delta variant became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain,” they said. Before June, the rate of breakthrough infections was 2.2 per 1,000 people per year. That rose to 7.3 afterward, as Delta spread.\n\n“People with a breakthrough infection after full vaccination were more likely to be older and women. People with HIV infection, rheumatoid arthritis, and solid organ transplant had a higher rate of breakthrough infection,” they wrote.\n\nPeople with other types of immunocompromising conditions did not have higher rates of breakthrough infections, they found.\n\nVaccination protected everyone, the researchers reported. But they said those getting immune-suppressing drugs for rheumatoid arthritis or because of organ transplants, as well as HIV patients, should take care to wear masks and avoid situations where they might be exposed.\n\nDr. Mary Nakamura, an immunologist at the San Francisco VA Health Care System, and rheumatologist Dr. Alfred Kim of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said the findings should encourage the immune-compromised to get vaccinated and boosted.\n\n“SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials did not initially include individuals with immune dysfunction conditions, which has led to some hesitancy in using the available vaccines in this population,” they wrote in an accompanying commentary.\n\n“However, several recent retrospective studies have reported reassuring data regarding the safety of these vaccines in immunocompromised patients, and the general consensus is that the potential benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risks,” the said.\n\nCDC lowers estimates of Omicron prevalence, saying the variant caused under 60% of Covid-19 cases last week\n\nThe Omicron variant caused 58.6% of new coronavirus cases in the US last week, which is significantly lower than previously thought, according to estimates posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLast week, the agency estimated Omicron accounted for 73.2% of cases the week ending Dec. 18.\n\nA CDC spokesperson told CNN last week there was a broad range of uncertainty for those numbers — as low as 34% and as high as 95%. She added agency would “adjust based on additional sequencing.” The agency has adjusted the estimate for that week even lower, from 73.2% to 22.5%.\n\nOver the past four weeks, Omicron has risen rapidly in estimates – accounting for 0.6% of cases ending December 4, to 6.9% the following week, then 22.5% and now 58.6%. The Delta variant makes up nearly all of the rest.\n\nMore on the CDC estimates: Not every Covid-19 test is sent for the extra genetic sequencing needed to detect which variant has infected someone. The CDC works off samples and extrapolates its estimates based on that extra testing.\n\nOmicron’s estimated prevalence varies widely based on geography. For example, in the region that includes New York and New Jersey, as well as the region covering Texas and its bordering states, Omicron was estimated to have caused upwards of 86% of cases last week.\n\nFinland announces new Covid-19 restrictions for those entering the country\n\nFinland announced Tuesday it is tightening entry into the country, requiring proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or full recovery from the virus within the past six months.\n\n“Internal border control will be reinstated at Finland’s borders starting on Tuesday 28 December. There will also be other changes to the restrictions on entry, and as of 28 December, the same restrictions will apply to everyone arriving in Finland from abroad,” the Finnish interior ministry said in a news release, adding that the new measures will be implemented until Jan. 16, 2022.\n\nAt least 78.8% of Finland’s population has been vaccinated against Covid-19 and received at least two doses of the vaccine, according to the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare.\n\nUS is seeing a ""very rapid"" rise in child hospitalizations from Covid-19, doctor says\n\nDr. Adrienne Randolph, a pediatric critical care physician at Boston Children’s Hospital, told CNN that children are “one of our most vulnerable populations” for infection from the more transmissible Omicron variant.\n\n“Now with Omicron, it may be more transmissible than Delta, that still has to be shown. But we are seeing a very rapid number of hospitalizations in children, they are one of our most vulnerable populations and have the lowest vaccination rates currently,” Randolph said.\n\nThe doctor noted that while the transmissibility of Omicron is part of the problem, the low vaccination rate is driving the increase in the hospitalizations of children as well.\n\nThe doctor offered parents advice, including urging them to get vaccinated and boosted because “if they get sick, they can’t take care of the children who get sick.”\n\n“Most of these healthy children are going to do fine, have a mild illness. It is supportive care. Also they need to try to isolate them as best you can to keep others from getting infected because children are contagious when they have the virus as much as adults, so it is important to prevent the spread further,” Randolph said.\n\n“But most healthy children will do fine with Covid, and have a mild cold. And some don’t have any symptoms at all,” she added.\n\nHere’s what we know about children and Covid-19 hospitalizations: Nearly 2,000 children across the US right now are hospitalized with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 cases. That is up from around 700 just last month. In New York City, pediatric hospital admissions have jumped nearly five-fold over a three-week period.\n\nIn Washington, DC, nearly half of Covid-19 tests at Children’s National Hospital are coming back positive. In Chicago, hospitalizations have quadrupled over the past week.\n\nYour top questions about the new CDC Covid-19 isolation guidelines, answered\n\nCNN readers from around the world have asked more than 150,000 questions (and counting) about coronavirus. We’re reading as many as we can and answering some of the most popular questions here.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new isolation guidelines have sparked new questions about how to follow the measures and safely plan for New Year’s Eve events.\n\nHere are answers to some key questions:\n\nQ: What should I do if I test positive for Covid-19? How long do I need to isolate?\n\nA: “Given what we currently know about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, CDC is shortening the recommended time for isolation from 10 days for people with COVID-19 to 5 days, if asymptomatic, followed by 5 days of wearing a mask when around others,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a Dec. 27 update.\n\nThe update did not explicitly say how long infected people who still had symptoms need to isolate. The CDC has previously said people with symptomatic Covid-19 should isolate for 10 days.\n\n“To calculate your 10 full day isolation period, day 0 is your first day of symptoms,” the CDC said Dec. 9. “Day 1 is the first full day after your symptoms developed.”\n\nThe decision to reduce isolation times for those who are asymptomatic after 5 days was motivated by research showing the majority of Covid-19 spread “occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2-3 days after,” the CDC said Dec. 27.\n\n“Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others.”\n\nQ: What should I do if I was recently exposed to someone who now has Covid-19? How long do I have to quarantine?\n\nA: It depends on whether you’re fully vaccinated and boosted, the CDC says.\n\nThose who have received a booster shot “do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure,” the CDC said in a Dec. 27 update.\n\n“For people who are unvaccinated or are more than six months out from their second mRNA dose (or more than 2 months after the J&J vaccine) and not yet boosted, CDC now recommends quarantine for 5 days followed by strict mask use for an additional 5 days,” the CDC said.\n\n“Alternatively, if a 5-day quarantine is not feasible, it is imperative that an exposed person wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for 10 days after exposure.”\n\nFor anyone who was exposed to someone with Covid-19, it’s a good idea to get tested 5 days after exposure, the CDC said.\n\n“If symptoms occur, individuals should immediately quarantine until a negative test confirms symptoms are not attributable to COVID-19,” the CDC said.\n\nRead the full Q&A here.\n\nSeveral US states at or near all-time peak Covid-19 hospitalization levels\n\nEven as hospitalizations rise more gradually compared to surging Omicron case numbers, some parts of the US are seeing Covid-19 hospitalizations at or near all-time records for the pandemic.\n\nFour states — Michigan, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire — hit their all-time pandemic peak hospitalization numbers this month, according to a CNN review of data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAll four have seen hospitalizations decline in the last few days.\n\nOther areas are seeing hospitalization numbers near pandemic peaks.\n\nWashington, DC, with 363 hospitalized as of Monday, is nearly tied with its peak of 383 in January. Ohio, Indiana and Delaware are all seeing hospital numbers at least 80% as high as their all-time records last winter, according to a CNN analysis of HHS data.\n\nMadrid\'s New Year\'s Eve celebrations to go ahead\n\nThe Spanish capital of Madrid will be the only big city in Spain, and one of the few in Europe, to ring in the New Year with a large celebration.\n\nBerlin, London, Paris and Rome have all canceled their traditional festivities.\n\nOrganizers in Madrid have capped celebrations in the Puerta del Sol square, in the city centre, at 7,000 people, roughly 60% of the crowd expected in 2019, before the pandemic hit. People in attendance will be required to wear face coverings and observe social distancing rules, the organizers said.\n\nMadrid is the only one of Spain’s largest cities to carry on with its New Year’s Eve celebrations. Barcelona and Valencia have canceled their fireworks displays in a bid to get people to to stay at home.\n\nSix regional governments in northern Spain have agreed to coordinate early closing hours for restaurants, bars and nightclubs.\n\nThe six regions —Aragon, Basque Country, Navarra, Asturias, Cantabria and La Rioja — have a lot of movement between them and authorities in each wanted similar closing hours, the Aragon health department press department said.\n\nThe restrictions are similar to those implemented last week in Catalonia — a region that includes the city of Barcelona, known for its busy nightlife — where authorities announced rules to close non-essential businesses by 1 a.m. They also imposed a curfew between 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. in towns with more than 10,000 residents where Covid-19 cases are high.\n\nThe measures combined put restrictions on nearly 14 million people, about 29% of Spain’s population.\n\nThe Spanish Health Ministry’s latest data, issued late Monday, shows an increase in the rate of Covid-19 infections, from 911 cases per 100,000 last Thursday to 1,206 cases per 100,000.\n\nThere were 214,619 new Covid-19 cases since last Thursday, and officials have said the Omicron variant is rapidly gaining in Spain.\n\nFlight attendants\' union criticizes new CDC isolation requirements\n\nThe Association of Flight Attendants has criticized the CDC’s new isolation guidelines for those who test positive for Covid-19, saying it will be on the lookout for employees being pressured to return to work prematurely.\n\nThe CDC on Monday shortened the recommended times that people should isolate when they’ve tested positive for Covid-19 from 10 days to five days if they don’t have symptoms — and if they wear a mask around others for at least five more days.\n\nThe association notes that the five-day period only applies to those who are asymptomatic.\n\nApple closes all New York City stores to browsing\n\nCustomers will not be able to browse at Apple’s New York City stores as Covid-19 cases there rise. But they can buy products online and pick them up in person, Apple spokesperson Monica Fernandez said.\n\n“We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust both our health measures and store services to support the wellbeing of customers and employees,” Apple said in a statement.\n\n“We remain committed to a comprehensive approach for our teams that combines regular testing with daily health checks, employee and customer masking, deep cleaning and paid sick leave.”\n\nNew curfews in Indian capital with schools and gyms closed as case numbers rise\n\nAuthorities in the Indian capital of New Delhi have put further Covid-19 restrictions in place, including a nightly curfew, after a surge in Omicron coronavirus cases over the past few days.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the measures Tuesday after the city registered two consecutive days of a positive testing rate above 0.5%, the threshold that triggers an alert to be issued.\n\nA curfew between 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. will be implemented. Bars and restaurants will be restricted to 50% capacity, while the opening hours of stores in malls and markets will also be restricted. All health complexes, swimming pools, schools and colleges will be closed until further notice.\n\nDespite the new measures, Kejriwal sought to keep the city’s resident’s calm.\n\nIndia reported more than 6,300 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, the health ministry said. The country has also recorded 653 cases of the Omicron variant so far, of which 165 of those are in the wider state of Delhi.\n\nIndia’s national drug regulator also issued approvals Tuesday for two more domestically produced vaccines, the Serum Institute of India’s Covovax and Biological E’s Corbevax coronavirus vaccines, and emergency use of Merck’s Covid-19 pill molnupiravir.\n\nHoliday travel chaos continues with thousands more flights canceled or delayed\n\nMore than 2,000 flights have been canceled globally so far on Tuesday, as the surge in Omicron causes huge disruption during one of the industry’s busiest periods.\n\nAccording to the tracking website FlightAware, 2,046 flights had been canceled as of 4.20 a.m. ET. More than 600 of them were either domestic US flights, or international flights flying in or out of the country. More than 2,000 other flights have been delayed.\n\nMuch of the disruption has been caused by staff calling in sick, several major airlines have reported.\n\nGlobally, airlines canceled more than 6,000 flights on Christmas Eve, Christmas and Boxing Day. In the US, more than 1,200 flights were canceled and more than 5,000 were delayed on Sunday alone. More than 3,000 flights were cancelled on Monday according to FlightAware.\n\nUS bracing for post-Christmas Omicron surge\n\nCovid-19 numbers keep soaring as travelers scatter back across the country after Christmas and Americans prepare for another holiday weekend.\n\nThe US is now averaging more than 198,000 new Covid-19 cases each day, according to Sunday data from Johns Hopkins University. That’s 47% higher than a week ago and the highest such number since January 19.\n\n“I think we’re going to see half a million cases a day — easy — sometime over the next week to 10 days,” CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner told CNN on Sunday.\n\nAbout 71,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 as of Sunday, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nWith the highly contagious Omicron variant, “We’re certainly going to continue to see a surge (in cases) for a while,” Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN on Monday.\n\nLooking ahead to New Year’s Eve on Friday, small gatherings of fully vaccinated people will be safe, Fauci said. But he advised people to avoid large parties where they don’t know the vaccination status of all guests.\n\n“When you are talking about a New Year’s Eve party where you have 30, 40, 50 people celebrating, you do not know the status of the vaccination, I would recommend strongly: Stay away from that this year,” said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n“There will be other years to do that. But not this year.”\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nXi\'an reports highest daily Covid-19 count for a Chinese city since Wuhan\n\nNorthwestern China’s Xi’an recorded 175 locally transmitted Covid-19 cases on Monday — the highest daily infection count in a Chinese city since March 2020.\n\nXi’an has now recorded 810 locally transmitted cases since its cluster began on December 9, one of the worst localized outbreaks in China since Wuhan became the epicenter of the pandemic in 2019.\n\nXi’an, home to 13 million people, went into strict lockdown on December 23, closing public venues and transportation except essential services like supermarkets and hospitals.\n\nIt further tightened Covid control measures on Monday as local infections increased, requiring all residents to stay at home unless permitted to leave for mass testing.\n\nSoldiers sent to help: State-run newspaper People’s Daily said 150 military medics from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force were sent to Xi’an to assist in local hospitals on Monday, some with experience fighting the initial Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan.\n\nOfficial says outbreak is under control: While cases are expected to rise in the coming days, the Xi’an outbreak is under control, according to Wei Xiaoli of the city’s CDC. He told a Monday news conference that residents “don’t need to worry too much about the rapid increase of cases,” which have been uncovered by mass testing programs in the city.\n\nAccording to the National Health Commission, China reported 182 locally-transmitted symptomatic cases on Monday — 180 of them in northwestern Shaanxi province, of which Xi’an is the capital.\n\nOne case each was found in southeastern Zhejiang province and southwestern Yunnan province.\n\nRead more about the situation in Xi’an:'}}",97.08333333333333,2

Barely a year ago early in the year 2020, the unusual nature of coronavirus caused most governments to implement stringent steps in their countries to restrain the virus’s spread. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease impacted economies throughout the world, disproportionately impacting individuals who were already susceptible to poverty and hunger (Laborde et al., 2020a; Ceballos et al., 2020). In late December 2019, the virus was discovered in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 presented a major danger to human health, the economy, and food security in both industrialised and emerging nations (Mottaleb et al., 2020; Carroll et al., 2020; Alam and Khatun, 2021). Lessons learned from China revealed that various COVID-19 countermeasures such as lockdown in the country hampered production. This poses a significant risk to the long-term food supply (FAO, 2020), and has a negative impact on the economy, resulting in economic decline and crisis (Bai, 2020). It is important to understand that certain precautional and control efforts compromise agricultural production (Singh et al., 2021).\n\nThe virus wreaked havoc on the agricultural production sector, which is at the heart of the food chain (Pu and Zhong, 2020). The global spread of coronavirus resulted in the greatest economic downturn since World War Two (Hanna et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021). The epidemic’s major impact on agricultural labour input was the restriction of labour mobility. Farmers were not permitted to just go out and gather in any way except to purchase essentials. This resulted in a manpower scarcity and reduced mass production efficiency. For instance, due to a scarcity of migrant experts, producers from Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei in the grain-producing districts in China (south-eastern coastal district) were not able to sow their crops in good time (Pu and Zhong, 2020). Furthermore, wheat and pulse harvesting in northwest India was hampered due to a lack of migrant labour (Dev, 2020). Vegetable farmers in Ethiopia incurred not just financial loss as a result of overstocked items, but also from a lack of vital inputs (Tamru et al., 2020). Before the pandemic, suppliers may have planted six hectares in a single day, but due to the difficulties in finding tractor drivers during the pandemic, they were only able to cover three hectares a day (Pu and Zhong, 2020). Any interruptions in agricultural food supply will indeed result in supply and demand shocks, which will have an immediate effect on the agricultural sector of the economy with long-term economic performance and food security implications (Gregorio and Ancog, 2020).\n\nFood security refers to a situation where all individuals at all time have continuous physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to fulfil their dietary needs and food choices for an active and healthy lifestyle (Elsahoryi et al., 2020). Food security has been jeopardised both directly and indirectly as a result of the virus’s destabilisation of food systems and the effects of lockdowns on family revenue and physical access to food (Devereux et al., 2020). The presence of coronavirus disease has a negative impact on all the four pillars of food security, viz. availability of food, accessibility of food, utilisation of food, and stability of food (Nechifor et al., 2021; Laborde et al., 2020b). According to Genkin and Mikheev (2020), the report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Trade Organization, and World Health Organization (WHO) note the threat of a food catastrophe triggered by the current coronavirus pandemic, with a risk of a global “food shortage” owing to interruptions in the trade industry’s supply chain. According to the report, global commerce contracted by roughly 20% in 2020, with 90–120 million human beings falling into severe destitution and over 300 million facing food security issues in emerging nations. To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, world leaders implemented steps to decrease the number of commodities carried by sea, air and land, as well as labour migration at national and global levels. These variables contributed to a widespread disturbance in agricultural output and food distribution systems, posing challenges to the transportation of food and agricultural resources (Genkin and Mikheev, 2020).\n\nPresent literature centred on the effect of coronavirus on food security or effect of coronavirus on agricultural production (Elsahoryi et al., 2020; Nchanji and Lutomia, 2021). Despite the growing body of research on coronavirus, agricultural production, and food security, few studies have attempted to conduct a thorough assessment of the literature and map the present level of scientific knowledge on the effect of coronavirus on agricultural production and food security (ECAP-FS). Hence, the goal of this research was to examine the effect of coronavirus on agricultural production and food security by employing bibliometric analyses techniques to recognise keywords in connection to two core aspects, namely the most prolific or productive writers and the most collaborative nations, and then to examine the strength of their association over the study period. The study characterised intellectual processes further by visualising and recognising the advancement of the co-citation network, cooperation network, and trends in ECAP-FS research. This research will not only aid in the identification of present research on ECAP-FS, but also contributes to an improved comprehension of the scientific knowledge of coronavirus and its impact on agricultural production, food security, and the investigation of its evolution via published papers included in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. Because one database is unlikely to provide a comprehensive picture of knowledge and trends in a field, the authors recommend a four stage processes to achieve a merged database that integrates WoS and Scopus and then deletes identical publications using RStudio or R-package to perform author coupling, keywords co-occurrence network visualisation, university collaboration networks, and others using net2VOSviewer. This study will be among the few that explains how to integrate two datasets and utilise them to conduct different network associations in bibliometrix R-package (RStudio v.4.0.3 software).\n\nThe scientometric technique was used to retrieve articles relating to the effect of coronavirus on agricultural production and food security. This method used resources from two different databases, WoS and Scopus, for the systematic reviews. Table 1 shows the eligibility and exclusion criteria that was used to access the relevant documents. The various steps employed in the review process were (databases, identification, screening, eligibility, merging, duplicate removal and included documents) (see Fig. 1). Processing and analysis of the data were then applied to the remaining documents. Scientometrics is defined as the research approach utilised in analysing and assessing science, innovation, and technology by applying statistics and quantitative analysis to explain the distribution and visualisation patterns of research within a specific nation, issue, field or institution (Orimoloye and Ololade, 2021). Scientometric evaluations have been used to analyse scientific trends and outputs, as well as the evolution of research, author productivity, journals, and nations, as well as to discover and measure international collaboration (Orimoloye and Ololade, 2021).\n\nResources\n\nWoS and Scopus were the two-database used for this study. WoS is a database collection administered by Thomson Reuters Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) that contains databases on humanities, social sciences, biology (i.e., Biosis), science (i.e., Core Collection) and computers (i.e., Inspec). WoS was previously the only and biggest accessible database for bibliometric analysis. However, Scopus that was launched by Elsevier, with ease of use in universities throughout the globe emerged as a key rival for doing such studies (Echchakoui, 2020). Scopus has the largest abstract and citation databases with over 22,800 journals from 5000 publishers worldwide was used in the review (Shaffril et al., 2018). Moreover, It is the most comprehensive interdisciplinary database of peer-reviewed literature in the social sciences, and is generally acknowledged and utilised for quantitative analyses (Guerrero-Baena et al., 2014).\n\nCriteria for eligibility and exclusion\n\nVarious qualifying and exclusion criteria were considered. Title-based search for rapid visibility and retrieval was used. According to Ekundayo and Okoh (2018), a title-specific search offers the advantages of low loss, considerable retrieval, and sensitivity when compared to other types of searches such as a topic, field, or author search. First, concerning literature type, only journals and final articles were selected, which meant Article in Press, etc., were excluded. Secondly, non-English articles were excluded. Thirdly, a period of 6 years was used followed by the subject area, which focused on Environmental, Social, Agricultural, and Biological Sciences (Table 1) (Shaffril et al., 2018).\n\nSystematic review process\n\nTo explore the current literature on ECAP-FS, we conducted a comprehensive literature review according to the rules provided by Tranfield et al. (2003). The systematic review process for this study involved four stages. The review process was performed in April 2021. The first stage was the selection of databases (WoS and Scopus). The second stage pinpointed keywords utilised for the search process. Based on prior research, keywords similar and related to the effect of COVID-19 on agricultural output and food security were used with a total of (n = 9, 421) published records found on WoS and Scopus, respectively (Table 2). The third stage was screening. Out of (n = 9, 421) papers eligible for evaluation at this stage, a total of (n = 7, 203) papers were excluded. The fourth stage was eligibility where the complete articles were accessible. Following a thorough review, a total of (n = 1, 46) publications were eliminated since some did not focus on the effect of coronavirus on agricultural production and food security. The fifth stage was merging the two documents (n = 6, 172 = 178). The sixth stage was the removal of duplicates (n = 4). The last round of evaluation yielded a total of (n = 174) papers for qualitative analysis (Fig. 1).\n\nProcessing and analysis of data\n\nThe research assessed data obtained for scientometric investigation utilising RStudio v.4.0.3 software with bibliometrix R-package and net2VOSviewer after reading the articles relevant to the study. The data were imported into RStudio, transformed to a bibliographic data frame, and normalised for duplicate matches (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017; Ekundayo and Okoh, 2018). Net2VOSviewer (net,vos.path = NULL) embedded in RStudio v.4.0.3 software were used for visualisation. The VOSviewer programme created by Van Eck and Waltman (2009) is often used to visualise and evaluate a bibliometric network. Hamidah et al. (2021) and Zhang and Yuan (2019) made use of VOSviewer to analyse a bibliographic map on energy performance. Park and Nagy (2018) used VOSviewer to examine building control bibliographic data, and Van Eck and Waltman (2017) analysed citation-based clustering in the field of astronomy and astrophysics using VOSviewer. The research made use of Net2VOSviewer embedded in R studio to make visualisation maps, such as authors coupling, keyword co-occurrence network, and university collaboration network, based on bibliographic data. Each circle on the VOSviewer visual map represents a word. The term activity is represented by the circle and text size. The big circle and text show the chosen terms in a field. The distance between the two words reflects the degree of their association. In this case, the relationship between two words will be greater if the distance between them is small (Hamidah et al., 2021).\n\nWeb of Science and Scopus database merging for bibliometric analysis\n\nThe authors suggest the following four stage approach to combine the two databases shown in Fig. 1 and Table 3.\n\nAs soon as required articles were sourced, we downloaded the documents separately from WoS and Scopus databases. For WoS, we clicked on export, which redirected us to another window where we selected “other file formats” under record content, and “BiTeX” under file format before we clicked export. For Scopus, we went to export document setting where we ticked all relevant boxes including “BibTeX” before clicking export. The second step was to transform (WoS.bib and Scopus.bib) to “bibtex” files. Here we used R or Rstudio software by loading the bibliometrix package “install.packages” (“bibliometrix”), and “library(bibliometrix)”, After that we specified the pathway using the command file1<- “path/savedrecs.bib” and file2 < - “path/scopus.bib” for WoS and Scopus files, respectively. After that we converted file (1&2) using command “f1<-convert2df(file1, dbsource = “isi”, format = “bibtex”)” and “f2<-convert2df(file2, dbsource = “scopus”, format = “bibtex”)” for WoS and Scopus respectively. We merged the two databases in R/Rstudio. For this operation to be successful, we used the command “j <-mergeDbSources(f1, f2, remove.duplicated = FALSE)”. Finally, the duplicate documents were removed using the command “M < -duplicatedMatching(j, Field = “TI”,tol = 0.95)”. We performed a bibliometric analysis for bibtex file in Rstudio, using Aria and Cuccurullo’s (2017) techniques and scripts in R, and utilising the net2VOSviewer for keywords co-occurrence network, collaboration networks of universities, authors coupling, amongst others.\n\nBibliometric analyses results\n\nDuring the survey period, 174 papers were published on ECAP-FS; their characteristics are shown in Table 4. The research had 851 authors, with a cooperation index of 5.1 and a document/author ratio of 0.20 (4.89 authors/document). Except for nine authors who published alone, all 842 authors were part of multi-author publications.\n\nDuring the research period, an average of 6.0 citations per document were recorded. Lotka’s law scientific output for ECAP-FS study revealed a constant of 0.70 and beta coefficient of 3.88, with a Kolmogorov–Smirnoff goodness-of-fit of 0.94. Table 5 and Fig. 2 displays published research on ECAP-FS from 2016 to April 2021 in conjunction with the total citation of papers on average by year. The yearly pace of development was 56.64, with a mean overall of 12 ± 6, indicating that ECAP-FS research increased over time. This outcome agrees with the work of El Mohadebe et al. (2020) who stated that the number of published articles increased exponentially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise in COVID-19 research reflects that it is a major danger to human health, the economy, and food security in industrialised and emerging nations (Carroll et al., 2020; Mottaleb et al., 2020; Alam and Khatun, 2021).\n\nDuring the survey period, research production varied, peaking in 2020 with 38.5% (67/174) of the total research output, followed by 2021 with 66 research articles accounting for 37.9% (66/174) during the same time. This result is liable to change when additional papers pertaining to ECAP-FS are published in 2021. The average total number of citations for published papers changed over time, peaking in 2016 (average = 11.8). Furthermore, the findings of this analysis identified the top 20 most prolific authors from 2016 to April 2021. Table 6 shows Gong B as the most productive author over the time, with six papers accounting for 3.45% of the total research publications on ECAP-FS. The following were placed second on the list: Baudron F, Peng W, and Zhang S who published three research articles each accounting for 1.7% of the total published research articles within the study period. The rest of the 17 authors published two articles within the same year. The quantity of a researcher’s academic output demonstrates their efficacy and propensity for conducting quality research (Orimoloye et al., 2021a)\n\nCitation analysis reveals how many times a specific research article has been cited in other scientific articles. More cited research articles are considered significantly more influential than articles with fewer citations (Mishra et al., 2017; Nyam et al., 2020). Table 7 shows the top 20 papers on ECAP-FS in terms of citations in the field throughout the time. The list was compiled using the publications with the most citations (Echchakoui, 2020). In this research on ECAP-FS, Foyer et al. 2016 “Nature Plants” placed first with a total of 244 citations. Hart et al. 2018 “Functional Ecology” took second place with 60 citations, followed by Smiraglia D. 2016 “Environmental Research” with 52 citations during the same time period. Millar NS 2016 “Oecologia” and Tesfahunegn GB 2016 “Applied Geography” rated fourth and fifth with 43 and 42 citations, respectively. With 39, 23 and 21 citations, respectively, KC et al. 2018 “Plos One,” Pu and Zhong, 2020 “Global Food Security,” and Provenza FD 2019 “Frontiers in Nutrition” placed sixth, seventh, and eighth. As shown in Table 8, the leading active writers were connected with institutions in both emerging and developed countries, including China (28), the United States (19), the United Kingdom (12), Italy (9), Spain (8), Australia (5), India (5), and Mexico (5). With the exception of China, the majority of the articles were from developed countries. China, the United States of America, United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, among other countries, contributed the most articles in ECAP-FS, which is line with the work of Mottaleb et al. (2020). According to Orimoloye et al. (2021b), research funding and scholarships have had a significant impact on the research output of many countries. As a result, this study indicates that economic assistance could help in the advancement of research in the area of ECAP-FS. Furthermore, during the research period, the total citation of published papers on average by each nation differed from one nation to another. Table 9 shows the top 20 citations by nation for ECAP-FS research papers. The data indicated that the most mentioned nations were industrialised ones, while China, a developing country, placed second among the most often referenced nations. The exceptional success of China research suggests that the nation performs well in sponsoring field research, possibly because the coronavirus originated in Wuhan City of China (Mottalab et al., 2020). Italy leads the way with 112 total citations and an average article citation of 12.44 for research papers published during the study duration, China was second with 107 citations and an average article citation of 3.82. During the same time period, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ethiopia, and Canada were placed third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, with total number of citations (average article citations) of 81 (4.26), 76 (6.33), 47 (23.50), and 40 (13.33), respectively.\n\nThis analysis also uncovered the most relevant sources for published academic research on ECAP-FS between 2016 and April 2021, as shown in Table 10. Sustainability (Switzerland) was first with a total of 23 scientific papers on ECAP-FS. Agricultural Systems and Journal of Cleaner Production were ranked second and third with a total of 13 and 10 articles respectively. Global Food Security and Science of The Total Environment were rated fourth with eight articles each. Land was ranked fifth with five articles while Food Security, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Plos One were ranked sixth with four published articles each. Environmental Research and Journal of Integrative Agriculture rated seventh with three published articles on ECAP-FS throughout the review period.\n\nConcerns are growing about the influence of COVID-19 on agricultural production, which could pose a significant threat to long-term food security and food supply (Pu and Zhong, 2020). Table 11 summarises the top 20 academics’ most relevant terms. In addition, Table 11 displays the most important keywords linked to ECAP-FS research, including keywords-plus (ID) as well as author keywords (DE). COVID-19, Food Security, Agriculture, Climate Change, Sustainable Development, Agricultural Production, Biodiversity, China, and Sustainability were among the nine keywords shared by keywords-plus (ID) and author keywords (DE). Eleven keywords were peculiar to authors’ keywords (Resilience, Ecosystem Services, Food Systems, COVID-19 Pandemic, Food Supply Chain, India, Land Take, Life Cycle Assessment, Nutrition, Conservation, and Dietary Diversity), and nine keywords were unique to keywords-Plus (Food Supply, Human, Article, Food Production, Land Use, Agricultural Robots, Agricultural Land, Controlled Study, and Cultivation). The distinct author keywords explicitly defined what COVID-19 affected as well as the means or elements engaged in the process (Nutrition, Dietary Diversity, Ecosystem Services, Resilience, Conservation, Food Systems, and Food Supply Chain of People). COVID-19 (n = 27, 15.5%), Food Security (n = 25, 14.4%), Agriculture (n = 18, 10.3%), Climate Change (n = 9, 5.2%), Sustainable Development (n = 5, 2.9%), Agricultural Production (n = 4, 2.3%), Biodiversity (n = 4, 2.3%), China (n = 4, 2.3%), COVID-19 Pandemic (n = 4, 2.3%) were author keyword phrases related with the detection of ECAP-FS.\n\nThe keyword analysis identified Food Security in 35 (20.1%) and 25 (14.4%) published papers by keyword-plus and author keyword, respectively, while Agricultural was found in 28 (16.1%) and 18 (10.3%) published papers by keyword-plus and author keyword, respectively. By author keyword and keyword-plus, Agricultural Production was detected in 4 (2.3%) and 28 (16.1%) publications, respectively. In the ECAP-FS study field, Climate Change was detected in 26 (14.9%) and 9 (5.2%) papers by keyword-plus and author keyword, respectively. The review indicates that research on ECAP-FS emphasised these agricultural-related issues several times, implying that COVID-19 has an effect on agriculture, agricultural production, sustainable development, food security, and food supply of the general public, which is exacerbated by climate change, and is a major danger to food security, economy and human health (Mottaleb et al., 2020).\n\nThe connection between influential authors, keywords, journals, and trending topics was investigated using co-citation network analysis (Leydesdorff, 2009). Articles are said to be co-cited when they are cited and appear in other publications’ reference lists (Nyam et al., 2020). The top 20 authors coupling in Fig. 3 explains the authors coupling on ECAP-FS-related research. Every node in the network symbolises a distinct author who is linked to others. Connecting lines reflect author-to-author linking routes. The number of lines from each node correlates to the number of published papers that referenced the writer. The cluster of authors network, which comprises 20 nodes (authors), has no less than 18 interconnections. Other indicators of often expressed ideas and frameworks linked to ECAP-FS include nation collaboration (Fig. 4) and university collaboration network (Fig. 5).\n\nAuthors with multiple affiliations have made significant contributions to nation and university collaborative networks (Figs. 4 and 5). Our findings indicated that studies on ECAP-FS were conducted at institutions in both advanced and developing nations between 2016 and April 2021. The Wageningen University (Netherland), the China Agricultural University (China), the Zhejiang University (Asia), and University of Pretoria (South Africa) had the greatest collaboration network on ECAP-FS studies followed by the University of Western Australia (Australia), University of Leeds (UK), University of Alberta (Canada), University of Sydney (Australia), Case Western Reserve University (USA), Chinese University of Hong Kong (China) and the International Crop Research Institute. The University of Oxford was the only university that did not collaborate with any of the universities during the study period. Figure 4 depicts the networks of collaboration on ECAP-FS for 27 countries. The number of collaboration paths varied from one to 17. The number of partnerships was highest in the USA (n = 17), followed by China (n = 10), Australia (n = 8), the United Kingdom (n = 8), Canada (n = 5), the Netherlands (n = 4), Germany (n = 4), South Africa (n = 4), Uganda (n = 3), India (n = 3), Malaysia (n = 2), Denmark (n = 2), France (n = 2), Spain (n = 2), and New Zealand (n = 2). The remaining nations had one collaboration network. This outcome is consistent with El Mohadab et al. (2020) as the analysis of a nation’s collaboration is a vital type of analysis, because it allows for the visualisation of the most influential nations in a given field of research, revealing the level of scientific cooperation between the countries. The following network colour codes were prominent: light green for the USA network; light blue for the China network; purple for the Australia network; orange for the United Kingdom network; and brown for the Spain network.\n\nFigure 6 depicts the top 30 keywords of co-occurrence network, the related visualisation and the association strength of ECAP-FS. The co-occurrence of author keywords was examined to illustrate the research hotspots in ECAP-FS. The threshold for keyword co-occurrence was set at 10, and 30 keywords out of 708 were categorised as visualisation elements. The distance between the components of each pairings indicated topic similarity and relative strength. Individual term clusters were allocated different colours of circles. The network in Fig. 6 depicts three different clusters, each reflecting a branch of research in the ECAP-FS literature. The number of publications in which the keywords co-occurred was shown by the connections between specific keywords. The main themes with the highest overall connection strength in the ECAP-FS literature were COVID-19, Food Security, Agriculture, and Climate Change.\n\nThe ECAP-FS scientific field has three subfields (clusters of author keywords), which are as follows:\n\nThe blue cluster includes terms such as COVID-19, Food Supply, Food Production, China, Food Security, and Agricultural Production.’\n\nThe red cluster grouped the keywords Agricultural Land, Catering Services, Environmental Protection, Humans, Meat, Human, Food Industry, Article, Female, Priority Journal, Procedures, Controlled Study, and Environmental Sustainability.\n\nThe green cluster grouped the keywords Economic and Social Effects, Agriculture, Agricultural Robots, Sustainable Development, Climate Change, Land Use, Greenhouse Gases, Ecosystem, and Biodiversity. The findings revealed a significant variation in the co-occurrence of author keywords in individual articles in the ECAP-FS literature. This demonstrated the scientific field’s multifaceted and multidimensional nature. This result is agreement with the work of Orimoloye et al. (2021b).\n\nFigure 7 depicts the frequency of word occurrence of the top 70 most utilised title keywords in ECAP-FS studies. During the research, a word cloud was generated using the titles of published articles that contained the most frequently used keywords in ECAP-FS research. This revealed the most commonly used word or phrase in ECAP-FS research. Within the word cloud on ECAP-FS research, various regions of connections and the most significant words used were determined. For example, COVID-19, food security, agriculture, climate change, ecosystem services, resilience, agricultural production, sustainable development, food system, and China were recognised as the most prevalent or prominent themes in ECAP-FS studies.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8905438/', 'Headline': 'Editorial: The Effects of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Food Supply, Dietary ...', 'Snippet': 'Pandemic and Food Marketing.

Children were especially vulnerable: 144 million children under five were stunted (low height-for-age). 47 million children were affected by wasting, a life-threatening form of malnutrition.\n\nAs nutrition policy expert Rebecca Heidkamp and co-authors wrote in a Nature study, “the world was already not on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2—to eliminate hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.”\n\nThe goal of their study was to model the potential short- and long-term impacts the pandemic would have on nutrition and recommend policies to mitigate damage.\n\nWith modeling tools, they were able to determine potential impacts under optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenarios from 2020 to 2022. One big challenge was that the pandemic itself interfered with capturing critical data—in this case, an exact count of wasted and stunted children.\n\n“We’ve been struggling to know what the actual impacts have been,” says Heidkamp, PhD, an associate scientist in International Health who specializes in developing nutrition policy in low- and middle-income countries. At the start of the pandemic, UN agencies, including WHO and UNICEF, were dependent on phone surveys to collect data. This meant researchers “couldn’t go out and actually measure women and children,” she says, and “that’s what we care about in nutrition.”\n\nThe study points to evidence from phone surveys in Asia and Africa revealing disruptions in food supply chains and a spike in food prices resulted in dramatic increases in poverty and food insecurity in 2020, forcing families to shift to poorer diets.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, countries like India and Brazil have adapted and scaled up government assistance programs and social safety net programs, such as social protection and cash and food transfers, but public health experts predict these efforts will be insufficient to return to living standards seen prior to the pandemic.\n\nStanding Together for Nutrition: A Trusted, Unified Voice\n\nEarly in the pandemic, lockdowns especially posed a threat to global nutrition efforts, including the disbursement of iron supplements through prenatal care for pregnant people at high risk of anemia; food assistance for families, such as staples like flour, cereal, beans, and lentils; and routine interventions to prevent and treat acute malnutrition. In addition, school closures halted school feeding programs.\n\nThe crisis led to the creation of a research and advocacy consortium involving several Bloomberg School faculty including Heidkamp, called Standing Together for Nutrition, or ST4N.\n\nThe group includes nutrition, economics, and food and health systems experts. Their goal: to identify the potential impacts of COVID—and now the war in Ukraine—on food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries, and ultimately recommend nutrition interventions to mitigate excess stunting and child mortality.\n\n“Now rising costs of products used to treat malnutrition are threatening to interrupt those programs as they cannot reach as many, even as the need goes up,” says Heidkamp.\n\nThe study reports that in 2019, the UN World Food Programme estimated that 150 million people in 81 different countries needed food assistance. In February of 2022, it rose to 276 million people. The agency predicts that number to increase to 323 million this year alone.\n\nHeidkamp anticipates that 2022 will be a big advocacy year for nutrition. “There are many challenges as we look ahead. … but we need to keep shining the light on these issues and figure out who the right global players will be,” she says.\n\nIn the Nature piece, Heidkamp and co-authors urge “governments, donors, and the UN to help prevent a major exacerbation of malnutrition.” They recommend succinct steps these players must take to build more sustainable food systems that can help support affordable and nutritious diets for all:\n\nEnd trade restrictions that affect access to nutrition.\n\nSustain or implement social protection programs.\n\nProtect national nutrition budgets.\n\nHonor commitments already made.\n\nMobilize more resources for humanitarian assistance.\n\nHeidkamp says it’s donors and affluent groups like the World Bank that have the power to strongly influence other countries toward ending trade restrictions, implementing social protection programs, and activating humanitarian assistance in order to end food insecurity and malnutrition.\n\nGrace Fernandez is a communications and marketing specialist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nRELATED:'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9265790/', 'Headline': 'Food Acquisition during the COVID-19 Lockdown and Its Associations with ...', 'Snippet': '1.

The unexpected pandemic (COVID-19) quickly spread across the world, leaving not a single country unaffected by the worldwide pandemic. At the start of COVID-19, several countries adopted social distancing and lockdowns due to the virus. The existing pandemic’s discriminatory aspect has a negative influence on human health and the standard of living, as well as worldwide trade, supply chains, and major economies. COVID-19 has been shown to have an effect throughout the broader food supply chain, one of the largest significant sectors of any country, from the field to the consumers. There are currently substantial concerns regarding food production, manufacturing, delivery, and consumption in light of emerging issues within the food supply chain. Limitations on the mobility of workers, variations in consumer demands, the shutdown of food manufacturing industries, limited food trading regulations, and financial stress throughout the food supply chain are all results of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic (COVID-19) has changed consumer behavior and affected the business and economic sector. The purpose of this study was to explore the application of the Q-technique in the investigation of online consumer and manufacturer behavior in relation to end-user food purchases via digital marketing skills, supply chain possibilities, food purchaser and consumer happiness, and e-commerce infrastructure efficiency under the influence of COVID-19. The results show that in the crisis of supply chain management, clarifying the import food industry e-commerce supply chain crisis items, and determining their priority and strength can help enterprises make emergency decisions regarding supply chain operation; they can also be used as a reference for enterprises to use in responding to the crisis.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nSeveral countries worldwide recognized a state of health disaster as the COVID-19 virus spread extensively throughout six continents, and World Health Organization (WHO) advised that countries should prepare according to the Global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan. To deal with COVID-19, governments have implemented social/physical separation and self-quarantine under public policy. This has caused an industrial slump [1,2,3,4]. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected where and how individuals shop for goods and has expedited major changes in industries that have affected everyone. The pandemic has impacted consumer pathways, how retailers interact with one another (business-to-business connections), and how businesses collaborate with direct suppliers, distributors, and wholesalers. Market manipulation, as a result of low sales volumes and hoarding, has also had an effect [5]. There is also a massive rise in internet buying activities as a result of the large number of people who are confined. Additionally, COVID-19 is known to have caused global economic instability and uncertainties. The virus disrupted the supply chain, altered customer behavior, and prompted concerns about rapid cross-functional style evaluation. In today’s extremely dynamic market context, supply chain management (SCM) has emerged as a critical problem for long-term business growth. Enhancing corporate performance, in particular, is becoming a critical problem for long-term success [6].\n\nMoreover, consumers do not give much thought to how the food on their tables is produced. Concerns about food safety in the midst of a global pandemic, on the other hand, have focused attention on the massive infrastructure and workforce responsible for ensuring a safe and reliable worldwide food supply. Consumer demand for food has increased, particularly at the start of this global crisis, and some store shelves have been temporarily emptied, resulting in excess purchases of essential products. However, despite this unprecedented demand, the food supply chain remained strong, since many supply chain contributors, including farmers, producers, distributors, and retailers, have worked hard to restock the shelves [7].\n\nHowever, measures to effectively manage the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 imprisoned several countries and seriously affected their economies. E-commerce has supported the restoration of several economies that have been hit with a significant public health crisis. E-commerce internet sales supply chains are severely impacted. COVID-19, in particular, has produced significant online sales demands for the international food industry and has created major problems for the supply chain. The global COVID-19 pandemic has transformed dynamic settings from an abstract idea to a tangible reality for everyone. Widespread restrictions on the movement of people, in particular, have had significant logistical consequences. The goal of this study was to look at the uses of the Q-technique for issue identification in the exported food industry’s e-commerce logistics in a dynamic environment [8].\n\nThe data for end consumers before and after the COVID-19 outbreak shows notable changes. (1) Prior to the pandemic, user experience (reviews rating) had a strong favorable impact on the (relative) effectiveness of e-commerce platforms. Customer behavior has shifted as a result of the outbreak, and customers are now buying only what they want and need under specified circumstances [9,10,11]. Previous user experience (review ratings) has no impact in this scenario. Purchasing is dependent on what things are required at the time; (2) Prior to the pandemic, logistics outsourcing played a role in the association among reported supply chain competence and e-commerce platform (relative) effectiveness [12,13,14].\n\nThe association is the same before and post-COVID-19 epidemic, according to the findings. There is really no variation in the statistics during the pandemic for sellers either. Sellers are encouraged to produce products or run advertising campaigns for commodities that buyers require the most in this situation. In most industries, the economy is interrupted, and customers are concerned about the pandemic’s impacts. As a result, their actions may shift (particularly at the problem recognition phase of a customer’s decision-making process). Customers may purchase products required to support them in this situation, while rethinking and deferring purchases of desired items. The current pandemic’s discriminatory nature has a negative impact on human health and living standards, as well as global trade, supply chains, and major economies. COVID-19 has been shown to have an effect throughout the broader food supply chain, from the field to consumers, on one of any country’s most important sectors. In light of emerging issues in the food supply chain, there are currently significant concerns about food production, manufacturing, delivery, and consumption. Restrictions on the mobility of workers, changes in consumer demand, the closure of food manufacturing industries, limited food trading regulations, and financial stress throughout the food supply chain are all common outcomes of COVID-19.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate how the COVID-19 epidemic has affected the behavior of online consumers and manufacturers through digital marketing capabilities, supply chain potential, food purchaser and consumer satisfaction, and e-commerce infrastructure efficiency as it relates to the end user’s food purchasing effects. The paper is defined in six sections. In Section 1, a brief introduction of the present work is described. Section 2 presents the detailed literature background, investigating the pandemic’s consequences on the food purchasing supply chain and online food market using hypotheses. Section 3 consists of a detailed analysis. Section 4 presents the results and a discussion, followed by the study analysis in Section 5 and a brief conclusion in Section 6.\n\n2. Literature Background\n\nWith the emergence of COVID-19, the globe has been tormented by an unexpected risk to public health that has harmed the global economy and the supply chain. The unanticipated coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly expanded over the globe, and not a single country remaining unaffected by this global pandemic. The larger areas of infection began implementing massive social limitations (known as PSSB) on 10 April 2020, and other areas quickly followed suit. With the first instance of COVID-19 in regions of the world, the need for manufactured foods and pharmaceutical items rose. These results are also in accordance with findings on COVID-19 multi-impact management and findings on COVID-19 pharmaceutical/healthcare process innovations.\n\n2.1. The Pandemic’s Consequences on the Food Purchasing Supply Chain\n\nAgricultural production, post-harvesting management, manufacturing, distribution services, and usage of food products make up different phases within the supply chain. First, there are regulations that need to be followed by food companies and examined by the authorities. Considering the food supply chain, one of the most important sectors of the economy, it has been seen that COVID-19 has an impact on the entire process, from the field to the consumer. In light of recent challenges in food supply chain, there is now considerable concern about food production, processing, distribution, and demand. COVID-19 resulted in restrictions on the movement of workers, changes in the demands of consumers, the closure of food production facilities, restricted food trade policies, and financial pressures in the food supply chain [15,16,17]. Therefore, governments should facilitate the movement of workers and agri-food products. In addition, small farmers or vulnerable people should be supported financially. Facilities should change the working conditions and maintain the health and safety of employees by altering safety measures. Moreover, the pandemic also affects employees, as the virus spreads by human-to-human contact. Due to this reason, several governments closed their borders to the travel of workers; therefore, the supply chain has been highly affected. The COVID-19 virus has affected workers’ health. Moreover, the virus spreads by close contact with others experiencing COVID-19 symptoms; therefore, worldwide governments imposed very serious limitations on the transportation of all types of products, including food items, via land, rail [18,19,20,21,22,23], sea, or air. According to recent studies, food item transportation via these vehicles decreased by 65% due to border restrictions.\n\nThe COVID-19 scenario has had a significant influence on a number of industries, including agriculture, planting, and harvesting. Furthermore, before the incidence of COVID-19, a manpower shortfall was already a serious problem [6,8]. As a result of the increased manpower shortfall generated by the virus and the physical separation which must be maintained during manufacturing, this issue has an impact on the ability of farming and food manufacturers to work effectively. Food and agricultural product distribution was restricted by such conditions, causing issues in assuring a consistent supply of food to consumers [24].\n\nConsidering the facts that numerous industries rely on vital supplies, most of these are highly sensitive to shortfalls, as their supply must come from domestic markets. High-value goods are additionally affected through logistical constraints that influence food supply platforms because of their short shelf life [25]. As a consequence, the food industry’s logistic efficacy is crucial, especially during the above-mentioned global challenges. Two major important challenges within the food supply chain are obtaining raw materials from suppliers and ensuring food transfer from manufacturers to ultimate consumers. These problems are limiting the agricultural sectors’ ability to operate normally, and they could have serious ripple effects regarding food quality, freshness, and health, limiting accessibility to markets and causing price increases [26,27]. Governments need to take serious initiatives to reconfigure food supply lines while they fight the virus. The volume and mixture of agriculture products that varies by item and country determines the impact of virus insecurities for farming production. For agricultural productivity, high-income countries often use capital-intensive approaches, whereas low-income countries depend mainly on manpower. As a result, the supply chain must be kept functioning, with a special emphasis on the fundamentals of logistical issues [15]. Although dynamic settings have been highlighted as an essential study component in earlier SCM crisis management investigations, it is rarely considered a crucial factor in actual crisis management approaches. The global COVID-19 pandemic, on the other hand, has transformed dynamic environments from an abstract idea to a tangible reality for everyone. Widespread restrictions on the movement of people, in particular, have had significant logistical consequences. Meat, fruit, vegetable, dairy, ready-to-eat foods, and other consumable items are all part of the food industry [2,3].\n\nFood and agriculture industries, on the other hand, can be classified under two types: capital investments and manpower. Wheat, corn, maize, soybeans, and oilseeds fall into the first sector. In the second, high-value items include fruits, vegetables, and fisheries. Limitations placed between towns, provinces, districts, and countries restrict the transportation of food products. As compared to essential items, acquiring large products demands a great amount of effort. As a result, the time-sensitive nature of agricultural operations, as well as the need for higher output growth, may contribute to agricultural sustainability through technical advancement and manpower upskilling.\n\nThe constraints posed by movement restrictions (national or international border closures) and fluctuations in consumer need are significant. Consumers were unable to eat outside due to these limitations and were required to cook their meals at home. Furthermore, because of the risk of contracting COVID-19 in stores, customers avoided going to markets and supermarkets. The supply chain has an impact on not only manufacturers, distributors, and users, but also on labor-intensive food processing companies. The productivity of many companies was decreased, stopped, or significantly delayed as a result of workers who were determined to be positive for COVID-19 or who were afraid of getting sick at work, primarily at meat-processing food industries at the time of the epidemic. Because of these factors, it is estimated that production capability fell about 25% in late April of 2020.\n\n2.2. The Online Food Market\n\nConsumer packaged product companies must reconsider their products in a new manner, particularly in terms of the online experience, information delivery, and how customers engage with physical food products. Because more people are adopting the use of mobile devices for shopping, food companies must consider the online shopping experience, whether it be on smartphones or computers, attentively. Online purchasing (and the related experience), which is boosted by the pandemic, is anticipated to continue to become a significant new source for food items and services post-pandemic. As per food, online grocery shopping increased by 55% in 2020, up from 44% in 2019. According to 2020 research on online purchasing, “factors influencing buyer willingness to switch to online purchases are including potential risk, price-search intention, mobility, and time of delivery,” and “gender partially mediates the effects of behavior, design, and web appearance variables on shopping online concern. To make the transformation among online and offline shopping easier, online food retailers are focused on price, assortment, simplicity, and service” [14,16,17]. However, innovations in online shopping produces instability from known and routine behaviors, which can lead to increased risk levels, doubts, and distrust, which products and food marketers must be aware of.\n\nDespite a plethora of studies on online customers and their preferences, the elements that impact buying behavior are still poorly understood. The studies that have been evaluated are extremely diverse, focusing on different aspects of online consumer behavior. As a result, a complete approach is required that takes into account the amount of technological instability, an individual’s commitment to isolation, adaptation to online purchasing, the availability of an acceptable consumer experience, and decision-making speed. The presence of this knowledge gap necessitates a deep comprehensive exploration of online purchasing behavior under unstable pandemic conditions with respect to its key drivers.\n\nThe goal of this study is to create a composite measure of online purchasing behavior based on the drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic and then to use it to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on online consumer purchasing behavior, taking into account digital marketing competence, supply chain capability, customer satisfaction, and the effects of periodic discount rates and outsourced logistics. In the process of achieving this goal, the following six hypotheses (See Figure 1) were formed:\n\nHypothesis 1 (H1).\n\nOverall digital advertising potential is correlated to the performance of (relative) e-commerce platforms.\n\nHypothesis 1a (H1a).\n\nThe association among perceived digital marketing and (relative) e-commerce business effectiveness is mediated by seasonal discount rates.\n\nHypothesis 2 (H2).\n\nE-commerce network competence has a significant connection with observed supply chain abilities.\n\nHypothesis 2a (H2a).\n\nThe correlation among social logistics capacity and (relative) e-commerce network effectiveness is mediated by logistics services.\n\nHypothesis 3 (H3).\n\nUser satisfaction (reviews rating) is connected with (relative) e-commerce platform effectiveness.\n\nHypothesis 4 (H4).\n\nBuyer satisfaction (review ratings) is positively correlated with observed digital marketing potential.\n\nHypothesis 4a (H4a).\n\nThe correlation among observed digital marketing and buyer satisfaction (review ratings) is mediated by seasonal discount prices.\n\nHypothesis 5 (H5).\n\nBuyer satisfaction (review ratings) is positively correlated with observed supply chain capabilities.\n\nHypothesis 5a (H5a).\n\nThe correlation between observed logistics capabilities and buyer experience (review ratings) is mediated by logistics services.\n\nHypothesis 6 (H6).\n\nThere is no known relationship between observed digital marketing capabilities and observed supply chain capabilities.\n\n3. Methodology\n\nThe Q-technique, also known as Q-method, or Q-sort, analyzes qualitative participant assessments in which participants describe their views using statements or observations [9]. The present study employed the Q-technique to rank claims made by e-commerce specialists for purchased foods in order to determine the value of connotative factors for food purchased by digital shopping, which has been impacted by COVID-19. The research consists of multiple data sets where the buying behavior of online customers using e-commerce websites before and throughout COVID-19 is examined. The first dataset is made up of e-commerce network end users. The second dataset is derived from end users who responded to the study’s secondary phases recalling method (after the outbreak). The third set of data focuses on e-commerce network manufacturers. The fourth set of data included sellers who responded throughout the study’s second stage (after the outbreak). The initial stage of the study is to create a questionnaire based on a research study conducted in prior studies. The questionnaire is distributed to respondents using data gathered from a diversity of groups. During data collection, the researcher conducted pilot testing and reliability validation on the questionnaires. The detailed steps of this methodology are shown in Table 1 and Flat sort in Figure 2.\n\n3.1. Steps in Methodology\n\nThe steps in the methodology are: 1. Establish a Q-opinion parent group, 2. Obtain the Q-samples, and 3. Conduct a flat sort and Q-sort data analysis. Detained procedures are shown in Table 1.\n\n3.2. Questionnaire Design\n\nTo gather prior data from participants and describe factor properties from the gathered data, we devised a questionnaire that corresponded to the Q-classifications [9]. The final survey included analytical research results, COVID-19 implications influencing the purchased food supply chain issue, and connotation statements gathered from interview sessions; the questionnaire is structured using a 9-point scale, as shown in Table 2.\n\n3.3. Data Gathering\n\nThe questionnaire, which included Q-samples evaluated by specialists, is issued online to valid responders from randomized identified vendors, wholesalers, exporters, site owners, online shops, and logistics organizations involved in food imports. The goal of the data study is to identify items and their consequences for the influence of COVID-19 and its difficulties on import grocery retailers on the internet.\n\n4. Results and Discussion\n\nThere are 1300 end consumers who completed the questionnaire during the first process of data collection (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic). Around 80 of these 1300 responders filled out the second stage of the questionnaire (after the COVID-19 pandemic), as mentioned in the Table 2. There are 312 seller participants who completed the questionnaires during the first round. From the 312 participants who completed the second stage (after COVID-19 pandemic), during the third round, 56 completed the second survey.\n\nTo qualify for the survey, a participant must work for one of the top 20 digital commerce companies in the world. Amazon is the largest popular e-commerce site for both end users and vendors. End buyers used Amazon 86% of the time, while vendors used it 65% of the time. Items are removed from the end user and seller statistics when the component matrix outcome is less than 0.5. (Capacity for Digital Advertising) CDA 1, CDA 2, CDA 3, CDA 4, CDA 4, CDA 5, (Discount Pricing) DP 1, and DP 2 are the items shown in the end customer data. CRR 4 and CRR 5 are the items shown in the vendor data. Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6 show the validity of the leftover build items after the invalid data has been removed.\n\nFigure 3 shows the regression outcome after applying SPSS on the current developed research. Many hypotheses are eliminated because they have zero significant impact, according to the regression results. There are also some conflicts between data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n4.1. E-Commerce System Efficiency and Capacity for Digital Advertising (H1 and H1a)\n\nH1 has been discarded, according to data collected from end users and vendors before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests that the observed digital advertising capabilities have had minimal impact on the effectiveness of (relative) (e-commerce platforms. This is applicable for both end buyers and retailers before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Internet marketing practices, including digital marketing, may have seemed unnecessary in the process of problem identification due to internal factors (such as depleted inventories, frustration, new requirements, and assorted foods) or external factors (including digital marketing). It is believed that the participant samples for this research purchase items on an e-commerce site in response to an internal factor rather than external factors. As a result, perceived digital marketing has little bearing on the (relative) success of e-commerce platforms. Because sales advertising is primarily an external factor in the crisis identification stage, it does not mitigate the association between the two. The data before and after the COVID-19 pandemic indicated no significant differences.\n\n4.2. E-Commerce Network Effectiveness and Expected Supply Chain Capabilities (H2 and H2a)\n\nIn the context of end user data before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, the results revealed that H2 is recognized as the sign and ≤0.05 as an outcome. As a result, observed supply chain capacity has a considerable beneficial impact on the (relative performance of) e-commerce platforms. H2 is ignored as an indication, according to data collected from sellers before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, with ≥0.05 as an outcome; furthermore, before the COVID-19 pandemic, logistics management had an intervening influence among observed supply chain capabilities and e-commerce network effectiveness(relatively), although only for end consumers. End-user data collected following the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other hand, shows that observed supply chain functionality has no impact on e-commerce network (relative) effectiveness. Before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, the outcome for sellers was the same.\n\n4.3. E-Commerce Network Effectiveness and Customer Feedback Rating (H3)\n\nIn the statistics for end users and sellers prior to the pandemic, shown in Figure 3a,b, H3 is regarded as the sign, with the outputs shown as ≤0.05. As a result, it can be argued that user feedback ratings have a significant impact on the (relative) performance of e-commerce platforms. After the pandemic, however, the data from end users and sellers suggest that H3 is ignored as an indicator, with an outcome of ≥0.05. As a result, it may be stated that user experience has no major impact on the (relative) effectiveness of e-commerce platforms. Regarding the consumer decision-making process, the first stage, issue identification, might be triggered by an internal stimulation, such as a new need or want. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, some users’ behaviors, as well as their demands and desires, changed. Buyers are more anxious regarding their health and the outbreak’s financial effects (Accenture, 2020a). User feedback ratings may have an impact on e-commerce platform (relative) effectiveness prior to the epidemic, but not afterwards. It is possible that their needs and wants are fluctuating, therefore they purchase the items that they require the most. Many sellers respond to this, which might explain why buyer review scores are not affected.\n\n4.4. Client Evaluation Rating and Reported Digital Marketing Capabilities (H4 and H4a)\n\nH4 and H4a are not substantial in the data from end consumers before and after the pandemic. That is, consumer experiences (reviews scores) are unchanged by observed online marketing capabilities, and there are no intermediary effects of regular vs. discount price. H4 is recognized by the sellers, according to data collected prior and during the pandemic, while H4a is not. This suggests that observed online marketing capabilities have a considerable positive impact on customer experiences (reviews scores), but that regular vs. discount price has no effect on the two. Although there is a variation in the outcomes before and after the pandemic, there is a huge difference in the outcomes for end buyers and retailers. The observed internet marketing capabilities have a meaningful impact on the consumer experience (review ratings). The sellers, on the other hand, are severely impacted. This, according to the vendors, might be due to an effective internet marketing campaign providing a stimulation to their buyers’ experience.\n\n4.5. Customer Evaluation Ratings and Expected Supply Chain Capabilities (H5 and H5a)\n\nH5 is recognized as the sign, according to the regression results of end consumer and vendor data before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. H5a is not significant, although the output is ≤0.05. It can be determined that observed supply chain capabilities have a strong beneficial impact on buyer experiences (reviews scores). Before and after the pandemic, there are no differences in the outcomes for end users and vendors. Buyers are always worried about when their item will be delivered, so anticipated supply chain capabilities can affect the user experience (reviews scores). Furthermore, distribution procedures have been affected as a result of the pandemic and government regulations, such as geographical limitations.\n\n4.6. Observed Supply Chain Capability and Estimated Digital Marketing Capabilities (H6)\n\nFigure 3 illustrates how H6 is recognized as the sign, based on the regression results, with ≤0.05 as an outcome. This suggests that observed digital marketing capability is linked to observed supply chain capabilities in a positive way. A supply chain marketing strategy is a powerful instrument for acquiring customers, both before and after the pandemic. Geographical distances, time constraints, and limited mobility are all factors. Because of the supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic, the regulations for when personnel in working in areas such as inventory, products, and retail locations should work online are shifting. Throughout the pandemic, businesses took advantage of possibilities to optimize price offers and discounts for important buyers and locations in order to boost sales throughout the economic downturn.\n\nQuality goods and a connection to resources accounted for 65.6% of the significant priority rating for the identification of problems in the e-commerce supply chain for goods imported in the food sector. As a result, resource owners’ tendencies have an impact on industry development, with stakeholders emerging as the biggest beneficiaries of supply chain issues. Expert interviews revealed that organizations and operators remained significantly reliant on manufacturing and logistics to obtain commodities for every producer within the supply chain. To overcome supply chain disruption produced by the COVID-19 epidemic, many cross-border e-commerce businesses seek other businesses with production capabilities or commodity sources as replacements, building short-chains to shift orders. The impacts of a sudden crisis are investigated in this research, with a focus on identification after the problem has occurred. The Q-technique method is a study designed to take into account subjective perspectives, while also allowing for qualitative interviews and statistical surveys. It is more difficult for people and goods to move throughout the world as a result of COVID-19, and supply chain crisis response is confronting unprecedented hurdles. To extract extensive and in-depth information, this research combined comments from first-line operators and related employees, and used the Q-technique to identify supply chain problems, gathering strategies and perspectives for improvement in imported food e-commerce enterprises. Table 7 reveals the extracted factors using eigenvalue.\n\n5. Study Analysis\n\nThe consequences of the COVID-19 virus for food retail stores (SCs) and their resilience are explored in this research by using real-life pandemic situations as the inspiration. With the use of any logistics supply chain digital twin, we designed and used a discrete-event modeling study for SC operations and efficiency patterns. The findings of our research could help food retail SCs become more resilient in the face of future pandemics and pandemic-like situations. This study is formulated to overcome these gaps in the research.\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nThe imported food industry e-commerce supply chain is facing a pronounced impact on business challenges due to adverse environmental conditions, such as border blockades caused by COVID-19. This study used the Q-technique to investigate crisis detection for the imported food industry supply chain.\n\nThe study results established a set of 47 statements describing aspects of e-commerce supply chain impacted by COVID-19 that imported food e-commerce enterprises should recognize. Each statement was ranked by the perceived severity of the crisis to facilitate practical application for e-commerce business operators, and the factor strengths provide a reference for examining the supply chain crisis.\n\nThe cross-border e-commerce supply chain crisis detection results can be used as a practical operational basis for imported food e-commerce enterprise managers to examine their supply chain crisis tolerance and response. One drawback of this study is the small number of people who took part in the survey. The data was obtained near the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, which is a second constraint. In future studies, it is advised that the sample size be increased, that the three phases of COVID-19 be studied, and that the data be processed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine how the findings change.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, A.U.D. and S.M.; data curation A.A.-M.; formal analysis, A.A.-M.; resources, A.V.-M.; supervision, H.H. and S.M.; writing—review and editing, A.U.D.; software, A.R. and S.M.

Professionals rated the placement of the Q-sample statements as 2-3-5-8-11-8-5-3-2, accordingly (see Figure 2; for example, 11 signifies a neutral place in the middle of 11 statements), and we increased the Q-classification dispersion table to fit nearly normally distributed criteria.4Q-sort data analysisRespondent data was coded after expert classification, where score = +4, +3,…, 4, corresponds to points = 9, 8,…, 1, respectively. Our goal is to obtain the Q-sample categorization ranking chart for a professional Q-sort so that it can determine the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the purchased food product supply chain.\n\nTable 2.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was named by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) (Hui et al., 2020). Even though COVID-19 has a lower fatality rate than SARS, it has a higher transmission rate due to mutation and increased recombination of genes in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain S protein (Shereen et al., 2020).\n\nIn this study, over 633 million cases have been confirmed in over 230 countries, resulting in over 6.5 million deaths (CoronaBoard, 2019; Wu et al., 2020; Galvan et al., 2021). Despite this, unpaid particular antiviral medicines continue to spread new infections daily (outbreak worldwide presented in Figure 1). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection has a negative effect on each country's economy and causes marketing issues throughout the food supply chain. The precise source of COVID-19 is currently unknown. Phylogenetic comparisons show that SARS-CoV-2 is 96% similar to SARS-CoV, implying that bats are its natural hosts (Zhou et al., 2020; Han et al., 2021). However, no intermediate host has yet been identified to assist this virus in crossing the species barrier and infecting humans. This virus is known to be easily transmitted by respiratory droplets in human-to-human contact, and food surfaces are viral transporters (Mullis et al., 2012). The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have stated that there is no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission or direct contamination of food or water (CDC, 2021). The virus, conversely, can be disseminated by consuming food prepared and packaged on dirty surfaces or through transmission by an infected person during food handling or sharing (Galanakis, 2020; Han et al., 2021). In January 2020, at a conference, researchers infected a few people with COVID-19 via physical contact and shared meals (Pung et al., 2020), implying that food could be a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection channel. Using scientific information to find new ways to stop the virus from spreading quickly and to update international standards, it is important to find out how the virus spreads, including whether it can be spread through food.\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nDespite being a viral disease, the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is often treated with several antimicrobials (Wu et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2021). Healthcare professionals (HCP) use an empirical approach to treat COVID-19 patients regardless of the laboratory parameters due to the ambiguity of a successful treatment strategy (Fathi et al., 2021). The choice to begin antibiotics is typically made in response to clinical manifestations that resemble bacterial pneumonia (Lau et al., 2011; Bertuzzi and DiRita, 2020). The HCP is considering antibiotics as a treatment option due to concerns about community-acquired pneumonia, nosocomial bacterial superinfection in longer hospitalized patients, and high mortality due to COVID-19 among risk groups, including those over 60 and those with underlying medical problems (Li et al., 2005; Fathi et al., 2021). Worldwide, up to 72% of COVID-19 patients were treated with antibiotics (Lau et al., 2011; Bertuzzi and DiRita, 2020), but only 1–16% of these patients also had a bacterial co-infection (Lau et al., 2011). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were frequently used to treat various microorganisms (Lau et al., 2011; WHO, 2020; Fathi et al., 2021).\n\nAdditionally, COVID-19 was treated with antivirals (Li et al., 2005; Czarniecka-Skubina et al., 2021; Memon et al., 2021), antimalarials like hydroxychloroquine (Kassir, 2020), and antiparasitic medications like ivermectin (Kassir, 2020; Celorio-Sardà et al., 2021). Antibiotic use has increased and been sustained as a result of COVID-19 treatment. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is silently and gradually increasing due to empiric antibiotic use, becoming a major global threat (Assiri et al., 2013; Cockrell et al., 2016; Backer et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). As a result, there will probably be more cases of sickness and mortality both during and after the pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has voiced concern that the COVID-19 pandemic will worsen the AMR situation, which is already a pressing problem (Mahase, 2020; Filip et al., 2021).\n\nThe actual pandemic directly affected people's daily lives worldwide, with limited policies such as lockdowns, the use of face masks, and restrictions on individual movement (Clemente-Suarez et al., 2021; Tornero-Aguilera and Clemente-Suarez, 2021). Fever, sore throat, headache, dry cough, weariness, dyspnea, and infrequent intestinal indications are prevalent clinical symptoms, asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction (Singhal, 2020; Zhao et al., 2021). The common indications include fever, headaches, sore throats, dry coughs, lethargy, myalgia, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms (Zhao Q. W. et al., 2020). The contagion can devolve into respiratory failure, pneumonia, and mortality by the end of the first week (Singhal, 2020). In addition, the eosinophilic cell blood count appears to have a significant role in COVID-19 analysis and prediction (Clemente-Suarez et al., 2020). COVID-19 has been studied in relation to many characteristics such as socioeconomic position, age, sex, nutrition, and race (Dastoli et al., 2020; Fuentes-Garcia et al., 2020; Golestaneh et al., 2020). Nutrition plays a crucial role in immunological conditions and sickness. The nutritional intervention has demonstrated various approaches with varying outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in food hygiene, lifestyle, and diet in various parts of the world. However, with the current development of SARS-CoV-2, changes are still occurring, and much more information is being acquired. Ultimately, determining the wider health effects of COVID-19 depends on how the pandemic influences the world's population's mental, social, and physical health compared to pre-pandemic conditions. This review aimed to offer current nutritional attention to the current COVID-19 situation. This review scenario aims to gather issues about dietary patterns, nutrition, nutritional deficiencies, vitamin involvement, physical activity, and the antimicrobial activity of nutritional elements (Han et al., 2021).\n\nMethodology and data collection approaches\n\nThis review study is based on evidence from reputable journals on Google Scholar, LISTA (EBSCO), the Web of Science Core Collection, and PubMed. Key phrases such as SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, food supply, dietary patterns, nutrition, health, and publication date were also evaluated when searching for papers on the web. Most works published in 2020 and during COVID-19 (2019–present) were considered. A few studies published before 2020 and websites updating situation reporting are also acknowledged as documenting earlier viral outbreaks. This review study provided a broad and brief overview of the COVID-19 pandemic research landscape, which could be helpful for getting a general understanding of the subject.\n\nFood supply during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe food system is broad, multifaceted, interdependent, and capable of handling food security, safety, nourishment, quality, and industrial distribution (Clancy, 2017; Han et al., 2021). Food items frequently need components for multi-element preparations that are not readily available in the region; the absence of such substances can pose a substantial problem for food manufacturers, ranging from manufacturing to local, state, national, and worldwide points (Bhunnoo, 2019). However, it is essential to manage food worldwide to manage the crisis (Lima et al., 2018). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), COVID-19 has a two-pronged impact on agriculture: supply and demand are directly tied to food safety (FAO, 2020). The food supply chain connects farm operations to customer tables through production, packing, supply, and stowing (Chen et al., 2020). All segments of the food supply chain—fruit, bakery items, fresh vegetables, and food products—were severely harmed (Ivanov and Dolgui, 2020). The main pillar of four pillars (production, packing, supply, and stowing) of the food safety scheme has been significantly harmed by COVID-19 (Galanakis, 2020). Table 1 illustrates the suggested food safety processes for food subdivisions from farmhouses to users. Workers are classified according to their treatment circumstances, individual cleanliness, apparent cleansing, work environment hygiene, food preparation and distribution, and communal separation (Galanakis, 2020). Despite all the safety regulations across the food supply chain, consumption necessitates the most thorough safety considerations at the consumer level. Many food supply chains stopped selling rare steak and beef during the crisis to avoid contamination (Euractiv, 2021; Obayelu et al., 2021; Pravst et al., 2022). Furthermore, certain industries (meat processing) in the United States were completely shut down during the COVID-19 outbreak (Reiley, 2020). Therefore, food insecurity factors were involved during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 2) (Leone et al., 2020).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTABLE 2\n\nFood demand refers to interest in and willingness to pay for food during a particular time period (Mankiw, 2014). Due to uncertainty and dwindling consumer power, food demand has declined marginally. Furthermore, these conditions may worsen due to a lack of money and employment losses (FAO, 2020). Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increasing demand for food and beverages from virtual sources. Food shortages are unavoidable under such stringent lockdown circumstances, during which the maximum logistical supply has ceased. Due to the risk of getting sick, one cannot order food from online food delivery services such as Tomato and Twiggy (Narayanan et al., 2020).\n\nFood poverty is increasing because of the financial crisis due to COVID-19, and the number of individuals facing global food uncertainty may quadruple by the end of 2020 (WFP, 2022). Owing to heightened food uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic, developing and developed countries are in a similar scenario, with helpless and low-income populations suffering the most (Fitzpatrick et al., 2020). Authorities must play a crucial role. Everyone must have unfettered access to food that satisfies their basic needs for food security to encourage access to wholesome foods. An impending food crisis that disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable communities is signaled by a failure to act swiftly (Rosales and Mercado, 2020). FAO (2021) reported ~820 million people are the most helpless group, being affected by long-lasting hunger and not consuming sufficient nutrients to live a decent lifespan. Due to their lack of resources and access to food, the effects of the virus spreading farther across nations could be disastrous. Small farmers are a second vulnerable group who might be prohibited from working on their property or traveling to markets to sell their harvests or buy seeds and other necessary goods. Last but not least, low-income families' children are largely fed through communal programs; program interruptions due to the pandemic risk their food safety and nutrition, decreasing their ability to cope with illnesses. Therefore, to stop the spread of viruses, each country needs to keep up with programs that help people work together to take the necessary precautions.\n\nDietary patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's eating habits and nutrition patterns. Therefore, there have been differences in the category and period of family internment, the traditional and communal trends of the nations, the age of the trial investigated, and existing obesity, which have resulted in disparate assumptions. In Spain, it was found that the food consumed during the pandemic had higher energy consumption and lower nutritional quality than pre-COVID-19 consumption patterns (Batlle-Bayer et al., 2020). Furthermore, a 6% increase in daily intake was observed during the COVID-19 home confinement compared to 2019 (Batlle-Bayer et al., 2020). Similarly, a study in Poland revealed that people consumed snacks more throughout the lockdown, with this behavior being more common in bulky and obese people (Sidor and Rzymski, 2020). One possible explanation for this was that staying at home directly affected day-to-day food practices, resulting in increased energy consumption and demand for comfort food (Muscogiuri et al., 2020; Rodriguez-Perez et al., 2020; Zhao A. et al., 2020). Governments must assess how dietary changes that affect food quality (such as an increased intake of high-calorie meals) and a decrease in the consumption of wholesome foods (such as vegetables and fruits) may increase the prevalence of chronic diseases (Rundle et al., 2020). COVID-19 alters the rate of consumption of some foods as well as the amount consumed by others in terms of dietary composition (Rundle et al., 2020; Rodriguez-Besteiro et al., 2021). These results confirmed that staying at home and communal isolation had an adverse effect on adherence to vigorous eating practices (Rundle et al., 2020). In particular, a prior study found that Spanish people consumed fewer beverages, somewhat more eggs, and red meat and consumed much more plant-based foods, such as almonds, pasta, processed vegetables, or rice, than in 2019 (Rodriguez-Besteiro et al., 2021). Despite these modifications, red meat consumption remains higher than the suggested dietary requirements, whereas plant-based foods remain within the required choices (Rodriguez-Besteiro et al., 2021). Conversely, during COVID-19, the dietary patterns of the Chinese shifted, with a fall in the consumption of garden-fresh vegetables and fruit, poultry, rice, pork, and soybean foods (Jia et al., 2021).\n\nInterestingly, another report (Ruiz-Roso et al., 2020) found that COVID-19 confinement resulted in a healthy dietary adjustment in a teenage population from Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, and Spain, increasing the incidence of vegetable, fruit, and legume consumption during the lockdown. Thus, the proportion of adolescents consuming the suggested weekly portions of fruits and legumes during the lockdown increased by 8 and 7.7%, respectively, compared to before the lockdown. Numerous factors could support these pattern alterations. First, sales of fruits and legumes have surged since incarceration started, and second, people have more time to prepare meals at home (Ruiz-Roso et al., 2020). Several studies, for example, examined populations with innate eating tendencies. Furthermore, authorities in each country imposed distinct levels of lockdown, varying degrees of severity, and population limits. These reasons may be the root of the inconsistencies observed in previous studies (Opichka et al., 2019; Ruiz-Roso et al., 2020).\n\nSurprisingly, in all the categories affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, bulky and obese individuals had the worst dietary patterns and behaviors. These populations exhibit more troublesome eating patterns, such as food intake without feeling hungry and frequent overeating (Opichka et al., 2019). Because of a longer stay at home and typically limitless food access, bulky and obese people started eating and snacking more throughout their home confinement (Blaszczyk-Bebenek et al., 2020). Furthermore, participants with a higher body mass index consumed fewer vegetables, fruits, and legumes throughout the lockdown and consumed more meat, dairy, and fast foods throughout the lockdown (Blaszczyk-Bebenek et al., 2020). Furthermore, the lockdown altered the nutrition patterns of overweight children and teenagers, considerably boosting their use of sugary drinks, red meat, and potato chips compared with 2019 (Pietrobelli et al., 2020). These lifestyle modifications have the potential to increase fat mass (Larsen and Heitmann, 2019).\n\nThe long-term consequences of the negative dietary changes reported during the lockdown may include the development of unhealthy eating habits (Poobalan et al., 2014; Serra-Majem et al., 2020). During the lockdown, negative emotions such as boredom and worry increased the development of poor eating habits (Moynihan et al., 2015; Araiza and Lobel, 2018). Owing to the immunomodulatory effects of several macro-, micro-, and phytonutrients (Bhaskaram, 2002; Fernandez et al., 2021), a nutritious and balanced diet is a vital aspect of the personal hazard management plan during the COVID-19 pandemic (Gasmi et al., 2020). Furthermore, dietary deficits have been associated with increased host vulnerability to virus-related contagion and a more severe clinical course of sickness (Bhaskaram, 2002; Fernandez et al., 2021). As a result, while a healthy diet cannot entirely prevent illness, it can play a significant role in the host's response to an infectious agent (Blaszczyk-Bebenek et al., 2020). Surprisingly, other unhealthy habits followed the same pattern as food patterns. Thus, an increase in alcohol intake (15%) among alcohol addicts and an increase in smoking (Blaszczyk-Bebenek et al., 2020). Therefore, more investigation is needed to determine how food patterns changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide the necessary guidelines to endorse good behavior throughout probable future pandemics.\n\nEffects of vitamin ingredients as antimicrobial agents during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been related to other documented epidemics in the last 20 years, such as SARS and MERS (lower respiratory diseases), with comparable clinical symptoms in the early infection stages (fever and cough), resulting in significant fatalities among susceptible people (Das, 2020; Han et al., 2021). Consuming vitamins and functional foods can boost the immune system and aid in virus suppression (Gibson et al., 2012). Vitamin C boosts the immune system and is required for body tissue growth and repair due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties (Li et al., 2020). Furthermore, vitamin A is a fat-soluble molecule that plays an important role in immune function and lowers infection susceptibility (Huang et al., 2018; Shirvani et al., 2019). Isotretinoin is a cellular protein that regulates the downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry (Sinha et al., 2020).\n\nFurthermore, vitamins D and E can boost resistance to SARS-CoV-2 (Im et al., 2016). Bioactive lipids (arachidonic acid and other unsaturated fatty acids) can also boost resistance. Natural polyphenols such as hesperidin and rutin are effective against COVID-19 primary protease inhibitors and are key targets for therapeutic medicines (Adem et al., 2020). Herbal and Chinese medicines have been used to treat viral diseases. Ginseng root, for example, can be used to treat respiratory virus infections (Im et al., 2016). Astragalus membranaceus is widely used to treat colds and upper respiratory infections (Luo et al., 2020), but Pelargonium sidoides is an efficient herbal treatment (Kolodziej, 2011). Chinese herbal formulae are used as an alternative route to COVID-19 treatment and prevention (Pietrobelli et al., 2020). Some bioactive foods (quercetin) suppress the enzymatic activity of SARS 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). This is required for SARS-CoV-2 replication and can be used to treat COVID-19 patients (Yang et al., 2020). Dietary supplements (vitamins, botanicals, bioactive lipids, and flavonoids) may help the human immune system.\n\nNonetheless, there is no evidence that such bioactive compounds can sufficiently increase immune function to prevent or cure COVID-19 (Han et al., 2021). Furthermore, in the novel era of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are looking for suitable medications to enhance the immune system in the future. Nutritional deficiencies in macro- and micronutrients can have an effect on immune function and infection resistance (Filip et al., 2021). Several functional foods, including pepper, garlic, turmeric, and onion, may have immunomodulatory and antiviral effects (Table 3).\n\nTABLE 3\n\nHealth conditions\n\nThis section studied the associations between body compositions. The following issues are addressed: (a) body composition variations, (b) the correlation between body composition and changes (e.g., physical activity and nutrition), and (c) body composition as a risk factor.\n\nPhysical activity was marked by a sharp decrease at the pandemic's beginning (Ding et al., 2021). Those with a higher body fat percentage had less physical activity due to a lower fat proportion (Poobalan et al., 2014). Body composition was assessed by measures of fatness (Neovius et al., 2005), bioimpedance analysis (Ding et al., 2021), or BMI to investigate alterations between underweight, overweight, and normal-weight people (Gwynn et al., 2011; Bell et al., 2018). Obesity people are at an increased risk for COVID-19 (Freuer et al., 2021). For example, obesity class II increased the hazard of COVID-19 in individuals over 65 years; however, BMI has a linear relationship with the virus in adults aged 65 (Christensen et al., 2021).\n\nFurthermore, visceral fat was found in patients with COVID-19 who required critical care (Favre et al., 2021). In COVID-19, body composition was assessed using the waist circumference/paravertebral muscle circumference ratio. It was proposed as a predictor of a poor clinical outcome on low-dose computed tomography of the chest (Kottlors et al., 2020). Additionally, abdominal obesity in COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms was found to be an independent risk factor for respiratory distress as determined by the waist-to-hip ratio (van Zelst et al., 2020). Obesity may also have an impact on immune responses to viruses, inflammatory reactions, and metabolic and respiratory issues (Coelho-Ravagnani et al., 2021; Sinska et al., 2021). It could be explained by its effect on immunity, which alters the etiology of ARF (acute renal failure) and pneumonia (Rebello et al., 2020). In COVID-19, obesity and morbid obesity were identified as major risk factors for ICU admission (Foldi et al., 2020). Obese patients with a higher BMI should be constantly monitored and may require medication assistance sooner to treat colds and upper respiratory infections (Zhao X. et al., 2020). Obesity or BMI should be considered key indicators, and obese COVID-19 patients should be considered a high-risk group (Tamara and Tahapary, 2020; Yang et al., 2021). Regarding energy balance, the negative changes in body composition during a pandemic should be endorsed to match changes in physical activity and diet, indicating a decrease in energy expenditure and an increase in caloric absorption (Huber et al., 2021). Furthermore, obesity reduces vaccine efficacy in people suffering from rabies, hepatitis B, tetanus, and influenza; thus, immunization conditions and constraints on the efficiency of COVID-19 inoculation should be considered (Liu et al., 2017).\n\nNutrition at multilevel and health conditions\n\nPrevious pandemics have shown that as a pandemic progresses, it is critical to expanding community health efforts through clinical supervision to include basic supervision concepts and optimize resource usage. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, personal and social resilience have emerged as valuable resources and continue to be the first line of defense in crisis response. Indeed, mental and behavioral countermeasures at both the personal and communal levels are critical factors in accomplishing public health ingenuities in the face of a pandemic with the magnitude of COVID-19 (Reissman et al., 2006). Individual nutritional status has long been considered a prognosticator of flexibility and instability (Cobb, 2011). The ecology of difficulty and flexibility indicates that significant stresses, such as deprivation of nourishment, can have long-term repercussions on health (Yousafzai et al., 2013). Deprived nutrition eminence is related to both corporeal and psychological health problems (Hislop et al., 2006). Optimal nutrition and dietary consumption are resources that extend beyond the personal and communal to have a worldwide impact (Ma and Lee, 2012). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this article suggests a plan of action (Table 4) for maintaining good nutrition on a personal, community, national, and international level.\n\nTABLE 4\n\nThe common denominator that drives most nutrition and dietary advice to treat viral infections, including COVID-19, is the relationship between food and immunity. Existing research indicates that nutrition significantly impacts the immune system and illness susceptibility. Specific food or nutritive element combinations influence the immune system via cell activation, signaling molecule synthesis changes, and gene expression (Valdes-Ramos et al., 2010). Furthermore, nutritional elements are important factors in gut infectious arrangements and, as a result, can determine the nature of the body's immunological responses (Wypych et al., 2017). Low immune function and increased sensitivity to infection have been linked to protein, energy, and micronutrient shortages. Maintaining immune function requires a diet rich in iron, zinc, and vitamins A, E, B6, and B12 (Nieman, 2020). So, the best way to keep an immune system that works is to avoid dietary deficiencies needed for immune cells to activate, interact, differentiate, or show how they work.\n\nPandemics cause consumer demand to be unclear and volatile, making it especially difficult to manage food supplies in a just-in-time economy (Vo and Thiel, 2006). A study of the effect of an outbreak on behavior found that stockpiling supplies, food, and water was the most common response (Kohn et al., 2012). Therefore, it is critical to raise community awareness of panic buying. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, older people and patients with chronic illnesses were especially vulnerable to nutritional imbalances. Existing data indicates that people aged 60 years and older and patients with pre-existing medical disorders, particularly heart disease, lung illness, diabetes, or cancer, are more likely to suffer severe or even fatal coronavirus infections. Second, given their sensitivity, the instructions to stay at home and practice social distancing explicitly targeted these populations. Third, due to their weakened health and reduced purchasing power, the elderly and patients with chronic conditions may already be vulnerable to malnutrition. So, at the community level, it is very important to find these vulnerable groups and help them get food by setting up a structured and reliable support system.\n\nWhile boundary safety is essential to protect the health of individuals, it can cause major disturbances in trade, travel, and tourism and infringe on civil liberties (Gostin, 2006). Therefore, ensuring the smooth flow of global trade and fully using international markets as a crucial weapon for guaranteeing global food supplies and eliminating food insecurity is critical. The worldwide nature of COVID-19, in which no country is immune to its spread and devastation, illustrates a fundamental lesson: a global threat necessitates global action. Each country's preventative measures should be complemented by global collaboration and coordination to ensure that humanity survives this epidemic with as few losses as possible. In summary, while there is still much to learn about COVID-19, its effect on nutrition and food consumption has already gone well beyond the individual and communal levels, reaching national and global levels. This outbreak underlined the interconnectedness of these numerous levels, as an individual's health directly resulted from his understanding and choices, community togetherness, government readiness, and, eventually, global action in response to this threat. From this perspective, a framework for action and recommendations are offered at each of these levels. Table 5 summarizes these recommendations.\n\nTABLE 5\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has a deleterious impact on people's diets and physical and mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people's eating habits were, on average, less healthy, especially during a lockdown, which was linked to weight gain. According to this study, there was a significant prevalence of food and nutrition-related worries throughout the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period. These worries were linked to a higher likelihood of reporting changes in dietary behaviors, such as food preparation and consumption. The capacity of the current dietary recommendations to manage dietary issues during a public health emergency is limited, and it is possible that they do not have the precision to offer dietary advice to various people. Age, weight, and income are among the sociodemographic factors linked to higher levels of food, nutrition, and health concerns, indicating the need for appropriate programs and policies to support disadvantaged people and lifestyle recommendations to encourage healthy eating. This study also sheds insight on probable explanations for this shift, such as depression, decreased shopping frequency, which is linked to lower fresh food consumption, and increasing fast food marketing. We also encourage scientists to anticipate future pandemic food and nutrition priorities as well as to build a more resilient food system that better integrates critical factors such as the food supply chain, nutritional security, healthy food accessibility, health, and food safety and preparation communication in the event of long quarantines. Developing long-term “exit strategies” and goals to prepare for future pandemics is vital. As a result, as also stated, a global food, nutrition, and associated science advisory council is needed to prepare for future pandemics and provide advice. The advising scientific body's recommendations must be shared and embraced by decision-makers to ensure successful and long-term program execution. It is important to practice food hygiene and eat a balanced diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables to maintain a healthy lifestyle and an effective immune system that can fight off infection and disease. Although there is no proof that the coronavirus may spread directly through food, packages may be contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 and could do so. Packaging may be required to contain bioactive substances that neutralize infectious contaminants to lower the risk of transmission. We essentially want to prevent more outbreaks that tax the healthcare system, given the possibility that SARS-CoV-19 will continue to spread throughout the population. Further research should be conducted on the psychological and physiological impacts of prolonged lockdowns, the probable persistence of altered behaviors, and their effects on personal and societal health in the post-lockdown and post-pandemic eras.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nConceptualization, software, validation, formal analysis, investigation, resources, writing—original draft preparation, and visualization: PR.

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-did-it-robby-mook-michael-sussmann-donald-trump-russia-collusion-alfa-bank-11653084709', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton Did It - WSJ - The Wall Street Journal', 'Snippet': 'The Russia-Trump collusion narrative of 2016 and beyond was a dirty trick for the ages, and now we know it came from the top—candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Clinton was fined $8,000 and the DNC was fined $105,000. The Washington Examiner was first to report the memo on Wednesday.\n\nThe DNC and the Clinton campaign paid over $1 million to the law firm Perkins Coie for information that Fusion GPS had on the dossier, which eventually led to the so-called “Russia hoax.” Both the party and campaign then concealed why they transferred the money, claiming it was for “legal advice and services.”\n\nDespite pushback from the campaign and the DNC, which argued the “legal services” label was appropriate because the money went to Perkins Coie first, the commission determined the groups violated straight-forward election law.\n\n“Solely for the purpose of settling this matter expeditiously and to avoid further legal costs, respondent[s] does not concede, but will not further contest the commission’s finding of probable cause to proceed,” the FEC said.\n\n“This may well be the first time that Hillary Clinton — one of the most evidently corrupt politicians in American history — has actually been held legally accountable, and I’m proud to have forced the FEC to do their job for once,” Dan Backer, who filed the complaint for CRF, told Secrets, as reported by the Examiner. “The Coolidge Reagan Foundation proved that with pluck and grit, Americans who stand with integrity can stand up to the Clinton machine and other corrupt political elites.”\n\n“Hillary Clinton and her cronies willfully engaged in the greatest political fraud in history — destroying our nation’s faith in the electoral process, and it’s high time they were held accountable,” he added. “I hope this is only the beginning.”\n\nEarlier this month, Trump sued Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and a number of other individuals and entities, accusing them of attempting to rig the 2016 U.S. presidential election by fabricating a connection between his campaign and Russia.\n\nFiled in federal court in Florida, the lawsuit alleges “Hillary Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot” which “shocks the conscience” of democracy in the United States.\n\n“Acting in concert, the Defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty,” the suit claims. “Their far-reaching conspiracy was designed to cripple Trump’s bid for presidency by fabricating a scandal that would be used to trigger an unfounded federal investigation and ignite a media frenzy.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60868795', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton over Russian collusion allegations - BBC', 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton over Russian collusion allegations.

Flawed research by a former British spy tasked with a sensitive, and political, assignment. And an FBI scrambling against the election-season clock to untangle suspicions about foreign government collusion that it feared could have grave national security implications.\n\nA 306-page report by Justice Department special counsel John Durham is refocusing negative attention on one of the most politically significant investigations in FBI history: the probe into whether Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign was conspiring with Russia to tip the outcome of the election.\n\nThe findings aren’t flattering for the FBI, with Durham asserting that it rushed into the investigation without an adequate basis and routinely ignored or rationalized evidence that undercut its premise. The report catalogs a series of errors — though many were already documented years ago by a separate Justice Department inspector general report, and the FBI says it’s taken several dozen corrective steps on its own.\n\nA look at some of the major findings of the Durham report.\n\nA ‘SERIOUSLY FLAWED’ INVESTIGATION\n\nThe report devotes considerable space to the FBI’s decision to open, on July 31, 2016, an investigation into possible criminal collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nThe probe was initiated after it learned from an Australian diplomat that a Trump campaign associate named George Papadopoulos had claimed to know that Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of emails. By that point, it was well known that Russian operatives had hacked Democratic emails, and Trump had even appeared to publicly invite Moscow to go looking for Clinton’s communications.\n\nBut, according to Durham, the FBI rushed into the probe without having any evidence that anyone from the Trump campaign had had any contact with any Russian intelligence officers. It identifies by name the Russia experts in the FBI and other agencies who were never consulted before the investigation was begun and says that had they been, they would have said there was no information pointing to a conspiracy between Russia and the campaign.\n\nThe report contends that the FBI fell prone to “confirmation bias,” repeatedly ignoring, minimizing or rationalizing away evidence that undercut the premise of collusion, including a conversation in which Papadopoulos vigorously denied knowing about any cooperative relationship between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nIt also says investigators did not corroborate a “single substantive allegation” in a dossier of Democratic-funded research that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, and yet continued to cite it in applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.\n\nBUT DID IT UNCOVER ‘THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY’ AS TRUMP PREDICTED?\n\nNo, it did not. Despite identifying abundant errors, the report and the broader investigation failed to live up to Trump’s hype. The former president claimed that it would reveal the “crime of the century” and expose a “deep state conspiracy” by high-ranking government officials to derail his candidacy and later his presidency.\n\nBut the report yielded only one conviction — a guilty plea from a little-known FBI employee — and the only two other cases that were brought both ended in acquittals at trial. And though Durham accused the FBI of confirmation bias, he did not allege that political bias or partisanship were guiding factors for the FBI’s actions.\n\n‘RIGOR, OBJECTIVITY AND PROFESSIONALISM’\n\nThe FBI responded to criticism of its actions by noting that the conduct occurred under different FBI leadership, months before current Director Christopher Wray took the top job. It also said it had already taken dozens of corrective measures designed to prevent the same problems from recurring.\n\nThose include steps designed to ensure the accuracy of applications the FBI files with the secretive surveillance court when it wants to eavesdrop on the communications of suspected spies and terrorists. For instance, the FBI said, agents must now provide more information, including identifying and disclosing evidence that might undercut their premise that probable cause exists for surveillance. In addition, the FBI has worked to improve oversight of confidential human sources.\n\nThe FBI said in a letter to Durham that it was confident that had those steps been in place in 2016, the “failures detailed in your Report never would have happened.” In a separate statement, it said the report “reinforces the importance of ensuring the FBI continues to do its work with the rigor, objectivity, and professionalism the American people deserve and rightly expect.“\n\nWAS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TREATED DIFFERENTLY?\n\nYes, Durham argues. He notes that the FBI in 2016 also investigated allegations in the book “Clinton Cash,” authored by a conservative writer who alleged foreign governments were funneling money to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for access. Both Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, and former President Bill Clinton have long denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe FBI labeled its reviews linked to “Clinton Cash” as “preliminary investigations,” Durham said. But the Trump Russia probe, he said, “was immediately opened as a full investigation despite the fact that it was similarly predicated on unvetted hearsay information.”\n\nHe argues the FBI showed caution about possibly influencing Hillary Clinton’s campaign that it did not show for Trump’s campaign.\n\nTo underscore his point, he quotes some of the text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, whose privately expressed dislike for Trump has long been cited as evidence of bias.\n\n“One more thing: (Clinton) may be our next president,” Page is said to have written Strzok. “The last thing you need (is) going in there loaded for bear. You think she’s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi?”\n\nAN UPHILL CLIMB IN CONGRESS GETS STEEPER\n\nThe Durham report is another blow to the FBI as it’s trying to persuade Congress that it is a responsible steward of intelligence.\n\nLawmakers are beginning to debate whether to renew a U.S. surveillance program that captures huge swaths of foreigners’ emails and phone calls. The program authorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act expires at the end of this year.\n\nThe Durham report calls attention to mistakes that Republicans have already cited as reasons for overhauling Section 702. The FBI did not use Section 702 in surveilling Page. But its omissions before the primary surveillance court have long rankled Republicans, who have signaled they won’t renew Section 702 without changes targeting the FBI.\n\n“It is essential that Congress codifies clear guardrails that prevent future FBI abuses and restores the public’s trust in our law enforcement institutions,” said Rep. Mike Turner, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, in a statement.\n\nA significant number of Democrats, meanwhile, separately want limits on when the FBI can search foreign surveillance data collected under Section 702.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/15/politics/hillary-clinton-john-durham/index.html', 'Headline': 'Durham interviewed Hillary Clinton on alleged plan to tie Trump to ...', 'Snippet': 'Special counsel John Durham’s report released Monday details his investigation of a purported effort by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign to tie Donald Trump to Russia but which Durham concludes ...', 'Full_text': 'Special counsel John Durham’s report released Monday details his investigation of a purported effort by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign to tie Donald Trump to Russia but which Durham concludes “did not, all things considered, amount to a provable criminal offense.”\n\nDurham reveals in a footnote that he interviewed the former secretary of State in May 2022 as part of his investigation.\n\nThe special counsel was looking into whether any crimes occurred in the handling of an uncorroborated piece of US intelligence indicating Russia knew of a Clinton campaign plan to vilify her opponent, Trump, by tying him to the country.\n\nThe 2016 intelligence got the attention of then-CIA Director John Brennan, who briefed the Obama White House and referred the issue to the FBI.

Durham said the dossier was “unvetted and unverified,” yet was used as justification for surveillance.\n\n“Indeed, based on the evidence gathered in multiple exhaustive and costly federal investigations of these matters, including the instant investigation, neither U.S. law enforcement nor the Intelligence Community appears to have possessed any actual evidence of collusion in their holdings at the commencement of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,"" the report stated.\n\nThe political implications are clear, and the report highlights the favoritism shown to the Clinton campaign over Trump’s.\n\nGive Biden family the Trump treatment\n\nAs Durham details, the FBI fumbled the “collusion” investigation. But mainstream media outlets also deserve blame for breathlessly going along with the Trump-Russia allegations.\n\nThe willingness to report negative rumors about Trump is in direct contrast to how the news media have protected President Joe Biden and his family.\n\nFor example, when the New York Post broke the Hunter Biden laptop story in October 2020, ahead of the presidential election, the rest of the media pretty much ignored it. Twitter even suspended the Post’s account for sharing its news reports. Emails from the laptop indicated Hunter Biden had used his dad’s position as vice president for his personal gain.\n\nThe story was slammed by Democrats and the media as Russian “disinformation.”\n\nNearly two years later, however, news organizations outside the right-leaning press finally admitted that the substance of the laptop story was real.\n\nNow, the media are largely ignoring – or downplaying – the findings of a GOP-led House Oversight Committee investigation that last week announced it had evidence that nine Biden family members have allegedly received millions of dollars for no clear business purpose from foreign nationals, including entities in China and Romania.\n\nAt the least, the allegations deserve further scrutiny. Imagine if these were members of the Trump family. The coverage would look vastly different, I’m sure.\n\nThe American people aren’t blind to these blatant discrepancies, whether from the FBI or the media.

He said New York Attorney General Letitia James ""should be ashamed of herself.""\n\nOver the course of four hours on the stand on Monday, Trump repeatedly strayed from the questions, earning reprimands from New York Judge Arthur Engoron on several occasions. The judge, who was seated just feet away from Trump, will decide the outcome of the bench trial himself.\n\nThe case stems from a $250 million civil lawsuit filed by James\' office, which accused Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives of a yearslong fraud scheme. The state alleges the defendants inflated the value of the company\'s assets and Trump\'s personal wealth to obtain better terms on loans and insurance. The attorney general is seeking to recoup $250 million and limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York. The defendants have all denied wrongdoing, and Trump has repeatedly accused James of pursuing him for political reasons.\n\nIn his testimony, the former president and current front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination stood by the valuations of various Trump properties that other co-defendants have sought to distance themselves from.\n\n""The numbers of my net worth are substantially more than the numbers reflected on the financial statements,"" he said in one exchange. ""Therefore you have no case.""\n\nTrump\'s testimony\n\nTrump arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan shortly before 10 a.m. and made brief remarks, reiterating his criticism of the trial.\n\n""It\'s a terrible, terrible thing. These are political operatives that I\'m going to be dealing with right now,"" Trump said. ""It\'s a very sad situation for our country.""\n\nOutside the courtroom, James predicted Trump would ""engage in name-calling, taunts and race-baiting,"" but said, ""At the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friend, don\'t lie.""\n\nTrump then took the stand. Kevin Wallace, a lawyer from the attorney general\'s office, kicked off the questioning by asking Trump about a trust he established to manage his assets before he entered the White House. When he left office in 2021, he took control of the trust, only to relinquish it again in July 2021. He testified that he did so because of increasing legal pressure from a number of fronts.\n\n""You and about every other Democrat district attorney, A.G., and U.S. attorney were coming at me from 15 different sides, all Democrats, Trump haters,"" Trump said, adding that he had ""great confidence"" in his son to manage his assets.\n\nTrump repeatedly gave long-winded answers to questions about the valuations of various Trump Organization properties, and Engoron\'s patience soon wore thin. Christopher Kise, one of Trump\'s attorneys, encouraged Engoron to allow Trump to give answers in his own way.\n\n""With this witness I would suggest it\'s far more efficient to listen to what he has to say and take it in,"" Kise said, prompting laughter from Wallace.\n\nEngoron\'s voice rose as his anger seemed to boil over, and his microphone struggled to handle the sudden change in volume.\n\n""No, I\'m not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron said, his voice rising. ""I\'m here to hear him answer questions. Sit down!""\n\nEngoron said he was considering drawing negative conclusions from Trump\'s testimony.\n\n""We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can\'t, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can,"" Engoron said.\n\nAfter a break, Wallace posed questions about the valuations of Trump\'s and his company\'s properties, including Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower in Manhattan and an upstate New York estate known as Seven Springs. Trump defended the financial statements listing their supposed value, saying that even those valuations that have been determined to be inflated were too low. He added that he would not be willing to sell several properties because they were worth so much.\n\nJames\' office says the documents, known as statements of financial condition, inflated his net worth by billions. Trump said the documents included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies.\n\n""The disclaimer clause says if there\'s a mistake, if there\'s something, don\'t rely on it,"" Trump said. ""[The disclaimers] always hold up in court, except maybe this court.""\n\nTrump also insisted that increases in property values over time justified overvaluations in the past, an argument Engoron has previously rejected. Discussing property valuations for 2014, Trump said, ""If you carry that forward to 2021, all of those valuations were low.""\n\nTrump became particularly animated during discussion of Mar-a-Lago, the Florida club where he resides for most of the year. Engoron\'s pretrial ruling finding Trump liable for fraud noted that the local assessor valued Mar-a-Lago at $18 million, while in documents Trump valued it at hundreds of millions more. The former president said in his testimony that he believes it\'s worth as much as $1.5 billion.\n\nThe property is ""deed-restricted"" and cannot be used as a residence, which experts previously told CBS News limits its value. Trump said he agreed to the deed restriction for tax purposes, acknowledging that the lower assessed value limits the property\'s tax burden. He then described a hypothetical scheme in which a person calls their own home a club to save money on taxes.\n\n""There are a lot of advantages to the club status, the smartest thing to do would be to have a club and have one member,"" Trump said.\n\nHe later argued about whether it was accurate to value one of his Scottish golf clubs as if he has built nearly 2,500 new homes on it, when in fact he has built none and is limited by contract to just under 1,500.\n\n""At some point maybe in my very old age I\'ll go there and do the most beautiful thing you\'ve ever seen,"" the 77-year-old said.\n\nLater in the day, Trump described a loan related to Chicago property as having been ""long since gone."" Pressed on that detail, he conceded it was actually paid off ""very recently.""\n\nWallace then asked, ""Are you aware that the Trump Chicago loan was paid off last week?""\n\nTrump said he was, and that, ""my son recommended it,"" referring to Eric Trump, who testified about that and other properties on Nov. 2 and 3.\n\nTrump said his company has begun looking into whether it needs to change internal policies as a result of the state\'s investigation.\n\n""There will be recommendations made, and we will perhaps let you know what those recommendations are, it wouldn\'t bother me to let you know about it. But we have asked,"" Trump said, adding that Eric Trump has been in charge of communicating with accountants and lawyers about that process.\n\nHe was excused from the witness stand shortly before 3:30 p.m., with the defense team declining to pose questions.\n\nThe fraud trial\n\nTrump is accused in the civil suit of being the primary beneficiary of a scheme to fraudulently portray his wealth as far greater than it is, and his properties as far more valuable, in order to get undeservedly favorable loan and insurance terms. The judge in the case has already found Trump, his two adult sons and their company liable for fraud, determining that the scheme led to hundreds of millions in unearned profits.\n\nThe trial is focused on other allegations, including falsification of business records, conspiracy and insurance fraud, as well as disgorgement — the exact amount of ""ill-gotten gains"" the Trumps must pay the state.\n\nTrump and his company have for more than a year blamed their former outside accountants, Mazars USA, for any inaccuracies in their statements of financial condition, essentially a snapshot of Trump\'s wealth. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump reiterated that defense in testimony last week, saying they ""trusted"" internal and external accounting teams.\n\nBut their former Mazars accountant testified in October that his firm merely compiled reams of financial information provided to them by the Trumps and their company.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking $250 million and sanctions designed to limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York, including permanently barring Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director in any business in the state.\n\nReporting contributed by Katrina Kaufman.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-expert-witnesses-billed-almost-900000-dollars-each-testifying-fraud-trial-new-york-city/', 'Headline': ""Expert witnesses for Trump's defense billed almost $900,000 each for ..."", 'Snippet': 'Trump to testify as final defense witness in fraud trial 05:12.

""But this expert witness, highly respected by everybody, with a resume that few people have ever seen before, said there was no fraud, there was no accounting fraud, there was nothing.""\n\nHe later praised Bartov\'s credentials as ""a leading expert, a leading person, a man who sits on the Pulitzer committee, most respected person, the Stern School, NYU, top professor, a very honest man who by the way, (is) very honorable,"" and said, ""If he didn\'t agree, he wouldn\'t say what he\'s saying. And he said these were incredible loans. I didn\'t even need the money.""\n\nBartov himself seemed to be a witness tailor-made for the former president in his superlative assessments of Trump\'s financial statements.\n\n""I\'ve never seen a statement that provides so much detail and is so transparent,"" he said. ""The footnotes provide an awesome amount of information.""\n\nThe professor also said that if the statements were turned in as a project in his class, ""they would get an A.""\n\nThe state\'s attorneys expressed skepticism about Bartov\'s findings, leading to some heated moments in the courtroom.\n\n""This is pure speculation from someone that they\'ve hired to say just whatever it is they want in this case,"" attorney Kevin Wallace, a lawyer for the state attorney general, said during an objection to Bartov\'s testimony Thursday.\n\nTrump\'s attorney, Jesus Suarez replied, ""Oh that\'s nasty, man.""\n\n""It is,"" said Wallace.\n\n""Very rude,"" said Suarez.\n\nBartov then shouted at Wallace, ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself for talking like that. You make up allegations that never existed. There is no evidence of this.""\n\nIn his testimony, Bartov strongly disputed the grounds of the lawsuit brought by Letitia James, the New York attorney general, saying that from an accounting perspective, it has no merit. He said that Trump\'s use of disclaimers in his financial statements clearly indicated that lenders should do their own due diligence and downplayed discrepancies in the financial statements, explaining that lenders are expected to make their own independent valuations.\n\n""To me, the case isn\'t about valuations. It\'s about statements of financial conditions,"" said Judge Engoron during a tense exchange with Trump\'s attorneys on Friday. ""You can\'t use false statements in business. That\'s what the summary judgment decision was all about. I think it\'s pretty much what the rest of this case was about.""\n\nJudge Engoron ruled before the trial began that Trump and the other defendants were liable for fraud in a partial summary judgment. Trump, his older two sons Donald Jr and Eric, and their company are accused of inflating the value of assets on key financial records to obtain favorable loans and insurance deals. They have denied wrongdoing in the case.\n\nTrump, who already testified last month, was scheduled to return to court on Monday, Dec. 11 but then announced the day before that he will not testify again after all.\n\nCross-examination of Bartov is expected to resume on Tuesday, as this case comes to a close.\n\n— Graham Kates contributed to this report.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1c247874-bca4-408d-a539-93f5f113ce0b', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump delivers heated testimony in New York civil fraud trial', 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump played down the importance of the financial statements at the centre of a civil fraud lawsuit as he took a tumultuous turn on the witness stand that provoked several rebukes from the ...', 'Full_text': 'The new FT Digital Edition: today’s FT, cover to cover on any device.

Eventually, the judge stropped trying to control Trump – he and the attorney general’s lawyer questioning Trump let him rant, and then mostly disregarded the missives.\n\nThe high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. Engoron has already ruled Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The New York attorney general’s office said they will rest their case after Ivanka Trump’s testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand:\n\nTrump’s campaign comes to the courtroom: The former president’s rhetoric at times during his testimony might as well have been at one of his rallies in front of supporters. He went after the attorney general. The judge. And the “political witch hunt” that he’s been railing against for years now. On the witness stand, the charged rhetoric was even more remarkable, as he attacked the judge sitting right next to him, with James in the courtroom watching his testimony just feet away. “The fraud is on the court, not on me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump gets an angry response from the judge: Judge Engoron tried at the outset of Trump’s testimony to stop the former president from making speeches and instead answer the questions, but it did little to change Trump’s approach. The judge responded by threatening to remove Trump from the witness stand, though that didn’t deter the former president either. “This is not a political rally,” Engoron said to Trump, telling Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise to “control your client.”\n\nTrump acknowledges changing valuation of Trump Tower triplex: The attorney general’s office pressed Trump on the properties central to his identity and brand: Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and other key parts of his real estate empire. The AG’s office attorney Kevin Wallace also pressed Trump on why valuations of properties were changed, such as his Trump Tower triplex, which was devalued on his financial statement in 2017 after a Forbes article found he had dramatically exaggerated the size of the apartment. Trump acknowledged there had on occasion been mistakes, such as the Trump Tower apartment valuation.\n\nTrump’s descriptions of his properties: The former president’s rhetorical flourishes went beyond attacking those who are investigating him. He also took the opportunity to play salesman and play up his properties. One of his chief complaints about the judge is a citation in his decision that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18 million, a number based on Florida tax appraisal records “It’s much more valuable,” Trump said of Mar-a-Lago, “and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes, that it’s biggest value is using it as a club.” Wallace took the answer to pin him down on that valuation. “You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” Wallace asked. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here.\n\nTrump finishes testimony in fraud trial; Ivanka Trump to testify Wednesday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has stepped down from the stand after nearly four hours of testimony in the civil fraud trial against him and his company.\n\nThe next witness will be his daughter Ivanka Trump on Wednesday, after which the attorney general’s office plans to rest its case.\n\nTrump’s attorney Chris Kise said he believes the trial should end in mid-December.\n\nTrump on whether he maintained accurate records from August 2014 onward: ""I hope so""\n\nWhen asked by the Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office whether he “maintained accurate books and records” from August 2014 going forward, Donald Trump said “I hope so.”\n\n“I hope so, I didn’t keep them myself. I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nJudge interrupts Trump\'s ""irrelevant"" answer to questions about Scotland golf course valuation\n\nAs testimony began centering on the valuation of Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland — Trump lobbed an answer that Judge Arthur Engoron audibly deemed “irrelevant” to the question.\n\nThe New York assistant attorney general asked Trump if the description in his 2014 financial statement was accurate for the property — which followed by Trump touting Aberdeen as a oil capitol making the property more valuable.\n\n“Irrelevant, irrelevant, answer the question,” Engoron said speaking over Trump, one of the few times that’s happened since returning from the break.\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to boast about the course.\n\nAs Trump gave a long-winded answer about the beauty of the course, Engoron said he would be following the assistant attorney general’s lead: “If you want to let the witness ramble on, non responsive, repeat himself.”\n\nThe assistant attorney general was trying, unsuccessfully, to get Trump to acknowledge a discrepancy on the number of properties that could be built in Aberdeen.\n\n“It’s sort of like a painting. You can do pretty much what you want to do. The land is there and you can do what you want to do,” Trump said.\n\nTrump questioned about the value of Mar-a-Lago\n\nDonald Trump says he believes Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\n“You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” asked Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nThe valuation of Mar-a-Lago has been one of Trump’s complaints about the judge in the trial, after the judge cited a Florida tax appraisal of $18 million for the property in his decision finding Trump, his adult sons and his company committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nWallace asked Trump if he approved of valuing Mar-a-Lago as if it would be sold to an individual as a resident. “Did I approve it on this? I don’t know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump replied, “I don’t remember that, no” when asked if he explicitly told former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg or former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney to value the property that way.\n\nWallace confronted Trump with a 2002 deed of development rights that shows Trump deeded away his right to use the property as anything other than a social club.\n\nTrump then gave a long aside about Mar-a-Lago when Wallace asked him about not being able to use it as anything but a social club.\n\n“I don’t mind leaving it as a club. In fact, if somebody wanted it, smartest thing to do, have a club and have one member and that would be the member that lives in the club. But it’s much more valuable — and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes — that its biggest value is using it as a club,” Trump said.\n\nWallace showed Trump a 2003 article in which the former president told a reporter Mar-A-Lago will always be a club.\n\n“I think that was said with bravado more than legal intent,” Trump said on the stand.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nWhat the scene is like inside the courtroom as Trump takes the stand\n\nIt was an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump took the witness stand a bit ago in New York. The former president slowly climbed a couple of steps into the box and raised his hand to take the oath.\n\nFormer presidents are typically surrounded by a force-field of deference, due to their status and are accompanied everywhere by Secret Service agents.\n\nBut Trump, in a blue suit, shirt and blue tie rather than his typical campaign uniform of white shirt and red tie, is sitting in the witness box alone in a leather chair, with wood panels on either side. His hands are clasped in his lap, and a large bottle of water and two smaller ones are to his left beside a screen allowing him to see court documents.\n\nThis is a civil trial rather than a criminal one. And the American people can’t see it because it’s not televised. But this the moment when the reality of the 2024 campaign hit home. Trump is simultaneously a multiple defendant, as well as being the Republican front-runner and potential next US president.\n\nThis is the most extraordinary campaign in modern history in microcosm.\n\nTrump says he would on occasion make suggestions on financial docs at heart of the trial\n\nFurther questioning in today’s civil fraud trial turned toward the financial documents at the heart of the trial, with Donald Trump saying he would look at financial statements, and on occasion make suggestions.\n\nTrump says of his statements of financial condition, “I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions.”\n\nThe former president says that bankers didn’t pay much attention to his financial statements, and says that is going to be part of their defense.\n\n“We’ll explain that as this trial goes along. This crazy trial goes along. Because we’re bringing in the bankers. Very big bankers,” Trump says. “They will explain exactly what their process is.”\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to. They looked at the deal,” he testified.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump arrives to court ahead of testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has arrived at a New York courthouse to face questions in the $250 million civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nJudge overseeing Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order on Friday\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order in the trial to extend to Trump’s attorneys after they raised multiple questions about the judge’s communications with his law clerk.\n\nIn a written order Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron prohibited Trump’s attorneys from making any further comments about confidential communications between the judge and his staff inside or outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe judge said violating the order would result in “serious sanctions.”\n\nHas a former president ever given testimony in his own civil trial?\n\nWhen Donald Trump takes the stand in his New York civil fraud trial Monday, it won’t be the first time a former president will have given testimony in his own defense in a lawsuit.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did it twice more than a hundred years ago, both when he sued a Michigan newspaper that accused him of being a drunk and later when he was sued by a fellow New York Republican whom Roosevelt had called a corrupt political boss.\n\nRoosevelt won both cases. Trump, by contrast, has already been found liable for fraud by the judge in New York.\n\nThose Roosevelt trials, separated by two years, were each sensational at the time, and they came after Roosevelt’s final campaign for the White House, when he placed second to Democrat Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after splitting with Republicans and running as a Progressive.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is very much still in the arena, and his legal strategy in a slew of civil and criminal cases is tied to his concurrent presidential campaign.

To all, Trump answered no.\n\nBut Suarez also asked her about what interactions Trump Organization executives may have had with members of Deutsche Bank, one of the financial institutions that received financial statements from the Trump Organization that have already been ruled fraudulent.\n\n""They were very happy,"" she said, of the bank\'s reactions to finished projects.\n\nShe also said they thought the Old Post Office in Washington, which for a time was the Trump International Hotel, was the ""crown jewel"" of their investment portfolio.\n\nThe pattern of questioning by the defense — which sought to establish the fact that no financial institution or anyone else suffered because of the Trump Organization\'s deals — could be how the defense makes the case that not only did Trump\'s actions harm no one, banks benefited from them.\n\nThe former president has often argued that he has done nothing wrong, adding that banks and buyers he dealt with were happy with the negotiations and final results. He argued it\'s not a crime because there is no victim. But under New York law, lying isn\'t allowed in business, even if no one was harmed.\n\nIndeed, the state attorney general\'s lawsuit argues that the manipulating of numbers to inflate or deflate net worth for financial gain is a crime.\n\nTrump, the elder daughter of the former president, is not a defendant in the case. She was called to the witness stand to answer questions regarding fraudulent financial documents filed by the Trump Organization.\n\n""She clearly was involved in negotiating and securing loans, favorable loans, for the benefit of the Trump Organization, for Mr. Trump, for her brothers and for herself,"" said state Attorney General Letitia James outside the courtroom. ""At the end of the day, this case is about fraudulent statements of financial condition that she benefited from.""\n\nIvanka Trump is expected to be the last witness called by the state attorney general\'s legal team in the civil fraud trial that will determine the penalties faced by other members of the Trump family.\n\nShe had been the executive vice president of development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization. During questioning led by AG lawyer Louis Solomon, Trump was asked about her knowledge of her father\'s statements of financial conditions.\n\n""Not that I am aware of,"" she said.\n\nTrump was also asked by the attorney general team about her involvement in executing the purchase of the Trump National Doral property in Miami. The attorney general\'s lawsuit alleges that Donald Trump\'s inflated statements were used to secure a $125 million loan from Deutsche Bank and were regularly submitted to the bank to fulfill Donald Trump\'s financial reporting requirements as guarantor on the loan.\n\nShe testified that she didn\'t recall if the bank asked for the statements or if she offered them.\n\nThe former president has been accused by James of being a part of a scheme that involved inflating or deflating the value of assets in order to secure better business, insurance and banking deals between 2011 and 2021. Trump\'s two older sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, are also defendants in the lawsuit. Judge Arthur Engoron has already ruled that Trump is liable of fraud.\n\nSeveral months ago, Ivanka Trump\'s attorney successfully argued that any related actions Ivanka had at the Trump Organization happened before the statute of limitations kicked in.\n\nOutside the courtroom, James argued that Ivanka Trump personally benefited from the inflated financial statements, even as she stepped away from the Trump Organization.\n\nDonald Trump\'s legal team is expected to begin their defense next week, with the goal of being done by mid-December.\n\nIvanka Trump is the last in her family to testify\n\nEarlier this week, Engoron heard testimony from the former president himself.\n\nTrump argued he was responsible for providing information to the accounting firm Mazars, which compiled the statements. While answering questions, Trump took jabs at Engoron, James and the trial. He took long tangents when answering questions, which annoyed Engoron, called James a ""political hack,"" and said he thought the trial was unfair.\n\nThroughout his testimony Monday, Trump argued that even the financial statements were conservative estimates of the value of his properties and that he relied on others to compile the statements. Still, he did acknowledge that he had a hand in reviewing some of the final numbers in the valuations.\n\nEric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are both executive vice presidents of the Trump Organization and held key leadership roles during the time their father was president.\n\nEric Trump at first denied having ""anything to do"" with the statements of financial condition. But the court was shown email correspondence between Trump and then-controller of the Trump Organization Jeffrey McConney (now co-defendant), in which Trump was asked to review and provide input on the statements and properties in the statements. Trump told the court he relied on others to ensure the statements were accurate, even if the court documents show he was privy to the process.\n\nHis brother Trump Jr. had a similar testimony. When asked directly by Engoron if he had anything to do with statements of financial condition issued by the Trump Organization, Trump Jr. said no, although he was responsible for the statements, according to documents shown in the trial.\n\nThroughout his testimony, Trump Jr. said also he relied on others, such as co-defendant and former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Wesselberg, to vet the statements of financial condition.\n\nMcConney and Weisselberg have also already testified.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/06/nyregion/trump-fraud-trial', 'Headline': ""Highlights From Trump's Testimony in NY Fraud Trial - The New York Times"", 'Snippet': 'The fate of his flagship New York properties, the future of his family business and $250 million: These are the stakes in Donald J. Trump’s civil fraud trial.', 'Full_text': ""Ranting and rambling as the courtroom pulsed with tension, Mr. Trump attacked New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, as a “political hack.” He derided the proceeding as “a very unfair trial.” And he scolded the judge overseeing the case, Arthur F. Engoron, for having decided before the trial that he had committed fraud.\n\n“He called me a fraud, and he didn’t know anything about me!” Mr. Trump exclaimed from the stand, pointing at the judge, who flashed a grin.\n\nThe outbursts demonstrated the former president’s disdain for a case that has already imperiled his family business and labeled him a fraud and a cheat. Ms. James, who has become one of Mr. Trump’s arch antagonists, has not only put his company on trial, but also called into question the richer-than-rich persona that he built over his years as a businessman and reality television star — the identity that propelled his run for the White House.\n\nMr. Trump, who was accused by Ms. James of inflating his net worth to defraud banks and insurers, acknowledged helping to assemble annual financial statements submitted to the banks.\n\n“I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions,” said Mr. Trump, who began the day looking tired but soon grew animated.\n\nAlthough the admission appeared to bolster the attorney general’s case, Mr. Trump, seated 30 feet from Ms. James, also sought to minimize the import of the financial statements, which he said he largely left to aides. He noted that they contained numerous disclaimers, making them essentially “worthless.” Banks paid little attention to them, he said, before promising, unprompted, that some of his bankers would soon testify in his defense.\n\nMr. Trump, the leading Republican contender for the presidency, brought combative campaign-trail energy to the courtroom, punctuating his testimony with grandiose claims and long-winded asides that infuriated the judge and obscured some of his more effective testimony.\n\nHe delivered an impassioned ode to his golf course near Aberdeen, Scotland, calling it an “artistic expression” and the greatest ever built. He assailed Justice Engoron: “The fraud is on the court, not me.”\n\nThe judge, who will determine the outcome of the case instead of a jury, repeatedly admonished Mr. Trump for not directly responding to questions from Ms. James’s team.\n\n“You can attack me. You can do whatever you want,” Justice Engoron told him, “but answer the question.”\n\nWhen the judge turned to Mr. Trump with a simple request — “please no speeches” — his words drew a smirk from the former president, who continued to meander. At one point, Mr. Trump interrupted Kevin Wallace, a state lawyer questioning him, with an “Excuse me, sir,” so that he could opine about what he would have done had he in fact wanted to inflate the value of his assets.\n\n“The net worth of me was far greater than the financial statements,” Mr. Trump scolded Mr. Wallace, later telling him that he should be “ashamed.”\n\n“People like you go around and try to demean me and try to hurt me,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Wallace.\n\nThe testimony pushed Mr. Trump far outside his campaign-trail comfort zone to the controlled environs of a courtroom, where lying is a crime and outbursts can land you in contempt of court. The deeply personal nature of the trial for Mr. Trump, 77, whose obsession with his wealth is a defining feature of his celebrity, injected an extra dose of emotion into his testimony.\n\nMr. Trump is fighting Ms. James’s civil case while facing four criminal indictments implicating him in everything from a hush-money deal with a porn star to an attempt to undermine American democracy. While the cases are a distraction during his third White House run, Mr. Trump’s lead has only grown. He has cast himself as a political martyr under attack from Democrats like Ms. James and Justice Engoron.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the testimony, Ms. James said that Mr. Trump had “rambled” and “hurled insults” but that “evidence demonstrated that in fact, he falsely inflated his assets to basically enrich himself and his family.”\n\nChristopher M. Kise, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, thought otherwise: “In my 33 years, I have not had a witness testify better,” he said.\n\nEven before Ms. James’s case went to trial, Justice Engoron had ruled that Mr. Trump’s financial statements were filled with fraud.\n\nThe trial will determine the punishment. Ms. James wants Mr. Trump to pay a $250 million penalty, be ousted from his company and be permanently barred from the world of New York real estate.\n\nOn Monday, as Mr. Wallace questioned Mr. Trump, the former president turned to the judge and lamented the way he had accepted Ms. James’s central contention before any evidence was heard in court: “You believed this political hack back there, and that’s unfortunate.”\n\n“Done?” asked Mr. Wallace, like a parent asking a child if he was finished with a tantrum.\n\n“Done,” responded Mr. Trump, and the questioning continued.\n\nThroughout the roughly four hours of testimony, Mr. Trump alternately accepted and avoided responsibility. When Mr. Wallace asked how he ensured that the financial statements were handled properly, he passed the buck to financial lieutenants and outside auditors, saying, “I gave two people total authority to work with a very expensive accounting firm.”\n\nMr. Trump added, though, that he was not entirely hands-off: “I said, ‘Prepare the statements so that the accounting firm is happy.’”\n\nFrequently, Mr. Wallace drew Mr. Trump in with simple questions about whether he had depended on the banks to rely on his financial statements. Mr. Trump affirmed that he had, without seeming to realize that the question went to intent, a necessary element for Ms. James’s lawyers to show.\n\nHe also couldn’t resist exaggerating in exactly the fashion that has left him vulnerable to the attorney general’s claims. When asked how big his triplex in Trump Tower is, he at first provided the accurate answer, 11,000 square feet. Seemingly unable to stop himself, he then said 12,000. Then, he said 13,000.\n\nMr. Trump also said that he had directed his employees to drop the value of his Westchester County, N.Y., estate, Seven Springs, because he “thought it was too high,” another acknowledgment of his involvement in the financial statements.\n\nWhile that appeared to undercut Mr. Trump’s task on the stand — to distance himself from the valuation of his net worth — parts of his testimony may have helped him.\n\nMr. Trump gave a tutorial of sorts on real estate valuations, noting that a lower cash flow in a given year might not depress the overall value of his flagship office building in the Financial District. And he pointed out that the banks he is accused of defrauding actually made money, arguing that they were hardly victims.\n\nHe also spoke about moments of restraint.\n\nWhen asked whether he approved the valuation for an office building, Mr. Trump said that he accepted it, not that he approved it, and did not instruct anyone to alter it. Asked if it was based on true and accurate information, the former president replied, “I hope so.”\n\nMr. Trump testified that he had an opinion on the worth of his properties, especially his Florida estate. “I thought that Mar-a-Lago was very underestimated, but I didn’t do anything about it,” he said. “I just left it be.”\n\nBut his expansive answers irritated the judge. As Mr. Trump spoke lovingly about Mar-a-Lago, calling it “beautiful” and a “success,” Justice Engoron looked up at the ceiling. The more Mr. Trump speechified, the more Justice Engoron rolled his eyes.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump blurted that Aberdeen was the oil capital of Europe, Justice Engoron barked, “Irrelevant, irrelevant. Answer the question.”\n\nIn a criminal case, a jury or judge cannot hold a defendant's refusal to answer questions against him. But this case is civil, and the rules are different: A judge can make what is called a “negative inference” — a damning assumption about why a defendant won’t answer.\n\nAt one point Monday, the judge, fed up with Mr. Trump’s nonresponsive responses, threatened to excuse the former president from the stand and assume the worst about why he wouldn’t answer.\n\nJustice Engoron also repeatedly appealed to Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Mr. Kise, to rein in the former president. As Mr. Trump puckered his lips and shrugged his shoulders, Mr. Kise replied that Mr. Trump’s stature — as the “former and again soon-to-be chief executive of the United States” — afforded him leeway.\n\n“Mr. Kise, can you control your client? This is not a political rally,” Judge Engoron said in the opening moments of the testimony, adding, “We’ll be here forever, and we’ll accomplish nothing.”\n\nBy the time Mr. Trump got up to leave the stand at the end of the day, the judge appeared relieved. He turned to the former president and held up his left hand in a goodbye wave.\n\nKate Christobek , Maggie Haberman , Nate Schweber , Liset Cruz , Claire Fahy and Susanne Craig contributed reporting.\n\nAlmost as soon as Mr. Trump took the stand on Monday morning, his penchant for long monologues appeared to irk Justice Engoron.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump gave one particularly lengthy answer, the judge turned and asked him to restrain himself, saying that he would like to move things along. “Please no speeches,” he told the former president. Mr. Trump sneered.\n\nNext, Justice Engoron pleaded with one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Christopher M. Kise, to control his client. “This is not a political rally,” he said. When Mr. Kise said that the judge should want to hear from the former president, Justice Engoron disagreed, saying that many of Mr. Trump’s comments were irrelevant. Mr. Trump sat silent for a moment before resuming his testimony.\n\nAt one point early in the day, an exasperated Justice Engoron suggested that he might wield some of the considerable power he has over witnesses in order to rein in Mr. Trump — including booting the former president from the stand entirely.\n\nSuch a move would have been deeply damaging to Mr. Trump’s case; it would have permitted the judge to make negative assumptions about questions that the former president did not answer. For Democrats and others who have long fantasized about Mr. Trump getting what they saw as a comeuppance, that possibility was tantalizing.\n\nBut after the midmorning break, the judge appeared less interested in cutting off Mr. Trump’s off-topic soliloquies. He allowed Mr. Trump to speak at length, as the former president praised one of his golf courses as “an artistic expression” and attacked the state attorney general, Letitia James, and the lawyer questioning him, Kevin Wallace.\n\nThe judge explained why he was giving Mr. Trump more latitude: Mr. Wallace, he said, seemed to be happy with what he was getting from his combative witness.\n\nAnd so Justice Engoron said nothing when Mr. Trump referred to Ms. James as a “political hack” or even when the former president turned and attacked him directly as a fraud.\n\nRather than a war of words, the two septuagenarians turned the courtroom into a contest of irritated expressions: The judge frowned, Mr. Trump glowered. The judge grinned sarcastically, Mr. Trump smirked — and smirked some more.\n\nAs Justice Engoron repeatedly overruled Mr. Trump’s lawyers’ objections, Mr. Trump again and again turned away from him and smirked. He smirked and cocked his head. He smirked and shrugged. He smirked and looked at the ceiling.\n\nBut as the judge gave him more leash, Mr. Trump took it.\n\nAt one interval, he pointed toward the judge directly and lamented a past ruling. “He called me a fraud and he doesn’t know anything about me!” Mr. Trump said.\n\nBy the afternoon, Mr. Trump was letting his facial expressions convey his disdain explicitly, punctuated by the occasional outburst.\n\n“You have no case,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Wallace at one point. “This case is a disgrace.”\n\nThose comments flew without comment from Justice Engoron. But the judge had a line he would not allow the former president to cross. Shortly before the lunch break, Mr. Trump asked to read a disclaimer that was included on his annual financial statements into the record.\n\n“I’d love to read this, your honor, if I’m allowed to do that,” the former president said, laying on the charm for a moment.\n\nThe judge told him he could not, at that point.\n\n“Shocker,” Mr. Trump said, making a sarcastic face.""}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/11/07/1211133180/trump-spars-with-new-york-judge-as-he-testifies-in-civil-fraud-trial', 'Headline': 'Trump spars with New York judge as he testifies in civil fraud trial - NPR', 'Snippet': 'Things got testy Monday when former President Donald Trump took the witness stand in his civil fraud trial in New York. Trump, who is the frontrunner for the GOP nomination for president.', 'Full_text': 'MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took the witness stand yesterday at a New York courthouse. He was there to answer questions related to fraudulent financial statements made by the Trump Organization, statements that were used to secure business and credit deals with banks and also to measure Trump\'s net worth. New York\'s attorney general is accusing Trump, along with several associates, of knowingly committing fraud by inflating the value of these assets. NPR\'s Ximena Bustillo was in the courthouse, and she\'s with us now to tell us what she saw. Good morning.\n\nXIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nMARTIN: Ximena, we keep hearing how it got pretty testy in there. What can you tell us about that?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, it didn\'t take long for the pair to clash. This is not the first time that they met face to face. Trump has come to multiple days of this trial, even though he\'s not required to. And don\'t forget that he was called up to the witness stand once before by Judge Arthur Engoron himself to answer questions about comments he made that violated a gag order. Now, yesterday during the first hour, there were some tense exchanges between the judge and Trump\'s legal team, Engoron at one point beseeching the Trump team to, quote, ""control him."" And that was his word, beseeching.\n\nAnd he felt Trump was going on long speeches, and some that included tangents about his properties and political success or how he thought the judge was politically motivated. Engoron seemed to have no patience for this and even went as far as to remind Trump that this is not a political rally. Still, though, Trump called the state attorney general a political hack and doubled down on many of the personal insults that he\'s been leaning on since the start of this trial. Trump\'s team also argued that the nature of this case, being that Trump is a frontrunner for the GOP nomination and there is no jury, should warrant longer answers than perhaps the judge wants.\n\nMARTIN: Speaking of those facts, let\'s just recap those briefly. New York Attorney General Letitia James says Trump was part of an effort to inflate and sometimes deflate the value of Trump Organization assets to get better deals. Trump and his co-defendants have actually already been found liable for fraud, so this trial will decide the potential punishment. James wants them banned from doing business in the state and $250 million in penalties. So what further arguments has the prosecution made?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, the attorney general\'s team has brought up various witnesses who worked within the Trump Organization and the accounting firm Mazars to generally ask about how these documents were created. And this includes the literal math - we\'ve been staring at a ton of spreadsheets - but also the hierarchy and power influence that higher-ranking Trump Organization executives, such as Donald Trump, may have had.\n\nUltimately, the executives of the Trump Organization, including Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., signed off on these statements that have already been found to be fraudulent and may have been responsible for them, even if they didn\'t do the number crunching themselves. Still, though, some witnesses have testified that Trump did want the numbers to be higher for certain perks, like landing on the Forbes Top 100 list.\n\nMARTIN: So we heard two of the president\'s sons, Eric and Don Jr., testify last week. His daughter, Ivanka Trump, is due to take the witness stand tomorrow. What can we expect to hear from her?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, Ivanka is the last witness that the attorney general\'s team is putting forward. And unlike her brothers, she is not a defendant. Her attorney successfully argued that any related actions Ivanka had at the Trump Organization happened before the statute of limitations kicked in. But the attorney general\'s team plans to rest their case after that, and then the Trump team will begin to lay out their case the following week.\n\nMARTIN: That is NPR\'s Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thank you.\n\nBUSTILLO: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF L\'ECLAIR\'S ""TAISHI-KOTO, PT. 1"")\n\nCopyright © 2023 NPR. All rights reserved.

Can’t do it.”\n\nHe continued: “For God’s sake, whose side are you on? Whose side are you on? Look, you’re either on the side of a mob or the side of the police. You can’t be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. You can’t be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6th ‘patriots’. You can’t do it.”\n\nTwo days later, Mr Biden gave a primetime address in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the Constitution was drafted.\n\n“Too much of what’s happening in our country today is not normal,” he said, adding that the man he defeated nearly two years ago – former president Mr Trump – and his “Maga Republican” allies “represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic”.\n\n“That is a threat to this country,” he continued.\n\nIt’s not the first time crowd-size comparisons are part of the political conversation.\n\nPerhaps the first scandal of the Trump White House involved the then-president and his aides making dubious claims about the crowd size at Mr Trump’s January 2017 inauguration.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://heavy.com/news/biden-georgia-rally-how-many-crowd-photos/', 'Headline': ""Biden's Georgia Rally Attendance: See Crowd Size Photos - Heavy.com"", 'Snippet': 'Biden Held a Drive-in Rally Attended by About 500 Cars.

Raphael Warnock. The rally took place in the parking lot at Turner Field, AJC reported.\n\nDespite the rally being a socially distanced, drive-in rally, some photos revealed that while attendees wore masks, not all were actually social distancing. Deadline referred to the crowd as “somewhat socially distanced” and noted that about 500 cars were parked in attendance at the rally.\n\nBiden advocated for the Democrat candidates in the runoff, in part because of the stimulus checks. He told the group: “If you send Jon and the reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door, restoring hope and decency and honor for so many people,” he said.\n\nHe also noted: “And if you send (Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler) back to Washington, those checks will never get there…”\n\nDuring his speech, Biden told attendees: “The power is literally in your hands, unlike any time in my career. One state, one state can chart the course not just for the next four years but for a generation.”\n\nHe also stated: “The debate over $2,000 isn’t some abstract debate in Washington, it’s about real lives. Your lives, the lives of good, hardworking Americans… If you’re like millions of Americans all across this country, you need the money, you need the help, and you need it now.”\n\nBiden criticized Trump’s approach to the vaccine rollout and the pandemic, saying: “This administration has gotten off to a God-awful start. The president spends more time whining and complaining than doing something about the problem.”\n\nDeadline reported that Biden went off script for part of his speech when he criticized Trump strongly. He also joked about winning “three times” when referring to Trump’s legal challenges to the presidential election.\n\nHe also said during his speech that he believes senators work for the Constitution, not for the President.\n\n“As president, I don’t believe your United States Senators work for me. I believe they work for the people of Georgia. … It is time for this nation for God’s sake to finally come together, finally.”\n\nHowever, near the end of his speech, he added that he was “more optimistic about this country than I’ve been my entire life.”\n\nWatch Biden’s Speech\n\nYou can watch Biden’s speech in the video below.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://heavy.com/news/trump-commerce-georgia-rally-crowd-photos/', 'Headline': ""How Many Attended Trump's Georgia Rally?

It’s part of a series of “Save America” rallies that he’s hosting. Here’s a look at how many people attended Trump’s rally, including crowd photos and updates about what happened. Opinions on how large the crowd was varied from person to person attending.\n\nThousands Attended Trump’s Georgia Rally, With Some Saying Attendance Was Smaller than Normal & Others Saying Attendance Was ‘Massive’\n\nThe rally took place at the Banks County Dragway (formerly known as the NHRA International Dragway) in Commerce, Georgia. Although doors opened in the afternoon, Trump’s speech was scheduled to begin around 7 p.m. Eastern, but he began about an hour late, Athens Banner-Herald reported.\n\nThe event was in part to support local Republican candidates or politicians, Athens Banner-Herald reported. Those on the speakers list included Herschel Walker and Sen. David Perdue who is running for governor. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was also among the people scheduled to speak.\n\nOpinions about crowd size varied. Some in attendance said the crowd was “massive.” However, other reporters said the crowd was much smaller than Trump used to attract. Here’s a look at the various reports. It’s not known if local police will share an official estimate, but we will add it to this story if they do.\n\nStephen Fowler of GPB News (an NPR affiliate) attended the rally and estimated on Twitter that there were about 5,000 people in attendance. He wrote that it was “the smallest Trump rally I’ve ever covered here.” He said it was much smaller than the 20,000 to 30,000-size rallies that Trump had hosted in 2020.\n\nGreg Bluestein of Atlanta-Journal Constitution shared a photo during the rally indicating that the crowd behind the TV risers didn’t extend “as far as the eye could see,” as Trump had said it did.\n\nFowler also shared a photo of the crowd, which was large but didn’t extend quite as far back as past rally crowds have done.\n\nHowever, Joshua L. Jones of the Athens Banner-Herald tweeted that around 5:30 p.m. Eastern, there was a “massive crowd” at the rally, and shared a photo of a packed crowd.\n\nBurt Jones, a conservative running for Lieutenant Governor, described the crowd as “huge.”\n\nTrump quickly began his speech by calling the current Governor Brian Kemp a “RINO,” as he supported one of Kemp’s opponents. He commented that he was angry that he had supported Kemp in the past.\n\nFowler later shared a photo showing the crowd differences between 8:50, 8:20, and 7:20. He said the cold and windy weather was leading some to leave early, while Trump was still speaking.\n\nTrump also commented to attendees that he believed Georgia was “red as hell” and voting for Perdue would be “a vote for this country.”\n\nAt one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz said he would nominate Trump to be the Speaker of the House.\n\nThis happened while Trump was bringing some of the candidates he endorsed, along with others, to speak on the stage with him.\n\nTrump Has Two More Rallies Scheduled\n\nTrump has two more rallies scheduled over the next two weeks, according to his website. A rally in Washington, Michigan, is taking place on April 2 at 7 p.m. Eastern at the Michigan Star Sports Center. And a rally in Selma, North Carolina, is taking place on April 9 at 7 p.m. Eastern at The Farm at 95.\n\nTrump’s first rally of 2022 was in Florence, Arizona in mid-January. Trump held a September rally in Georgia. He also held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, in October 2021, a rally in Alabama in August 2021, and an Ohio rally in June 2021. He also held a rally in Conroe, Texas, in January that was attended by tens of thousands, according to media at the event.\n\nIn his August Alabama rally, he was booed after telling the people present to take the vaccines. He replied: “You know what? I believe totally in your freedoms, I do. You have to do what you have to do. But, I recommend take the vaccines, I did it, it’s good. Take the vaccines.”\n\nTrump has not yet announced if he is running in the 2024 presidential election. However, he did tell the crowd during his speech in South Carolina that “we may have to run again,” and added “we will take back the White House.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/dec/21/donald-trump-rally-spotlighted-biden-trump/', 'Headline': 'PolitiFact | Donald Trump’s rally spotlighted the Biden, Trump ...', 'Snippet': 'However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.

The Trump campaign did not answer an inquiry for this article.\n\nSome of the statistics cited on projections at Donald Trump’s rally Dec. 16, 2023, in Durham, N.H. (Rebecca Catalanello/PolitiFact)\n\n""Under Joe Biden, we’ve had a three-year inflation rate of 20%.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe standard inflation measure, the consumer price index, has risen by 17.2% since January 2021, when Biden took office. That was an increase over three years, so the annual inflation rate was lower — about 5.9% per year during Biden’s presidency.\n\nRising wages have helped consumers manage some of this increase in prices.\n\nA standard wage measure, average hourly earnings of all private-sector employees, has risen by 14% during Biden’s presidency, or about 4.8% per year. That means wages are still trailing inflation by about 1.1% a year, but it’s a smaller gap than Trump’s headline number.\n\nThe time frame for the calculation also matters.\n\nAs inflation has cooled over the past year, wage gains have narrowed the cumulative shortfall from inflation. Since November 2022, inflation has risen by 3.1%, but wages have risen by 4%. If the pattern holds, wage growth during Biden’s presidency may soon surpass the increase in prices.\n\nAlso, Americans are in a better place than they were on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, which started during Trump’s last year in office. Since February 2020, the last full month before the pandemic hit, inflation has increased by 18.8%, while wages have increased by 19.4%.\n\n""After three years of Bidenomics, the 30-year mortgage rate has hit a 22-year high.""\n\nThis is Mostly True. Numerically, Trump is on target. However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage peaked at 7.79% on Oct. 26, 2023. That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.\n\nMortgage rates have spiked because the Federal Reserve in March 2022 began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Fed interest rate hikes are considered the most effective economic tools for curbing inflation, because they tend to cool the economy, which eases demand and lowers prices.\n\nSince the Fed hikes began, inflation has receded by about two-thirds. But a side effect has been that other types of interest rates — including mortgages — have also risen.\n\nSince the mortgage rate peak in October, the average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has fallen, hitting 6.67% on Dec. 21. Not counting the peak in recent months, that’s still higher than any rate going back to Aug. 2, 2007, when the rate was 6.68%.\n\nEconomists generally agree that some of Biden’s policies likely added to the pressures that pushed up prices.\n\nBiden’s coronavirus relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, put stimulus money into Americans’ hands when supply chains couldn’t produce enough goods to fulfill consumer demand. This worsened the rise of prices, which started because of pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions.\n\nHowever, ""the drivers of this inflation go back to COVID-19 — issues like supply-chain constraints, workforce shortages, and other factors,"" John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, told PolitiFact West Virginia in October. ""That is much larger than any particular Biden policy.""\n\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said Biden should ""assume some responsibility, but so should members of Congress who voted in favor of stimulus payments, tax cuts, generous unemployment benefits, aid to states and private businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic recession.""\n\nThe American Rescue Plan got no Republican support in Congress, but earlier pandemic relief bills Trump signed were passed with bipartisan support.\n\n""The average monthly mortgage payment: Under Trump, $1,746; Under Biden: $3,322.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThese are the figures for average monthly payments on a new home, real estate company CBRE reports. That’s a significant out-of-pocket increase for someone buying a new home, but it doesn’t affect homeowners who aren’t looking to move.\n\nThe figure is calculated for the purchase of a new home valued at the U.S. median of $430,000, with a 10% down payment.\n\nThe majority of American mortgage holders have fixed-rate mortgages that were locked in at much lower rates. In 2022, about 85% of mortgages had fixed rates.\n\nGiven the current high rates, adjustable-rate mortgages are gaining popularity. If mortgage rates decrease in 2024, homeowners who hold adjustable-rate mortgages should see their payments drop.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.goerie.com/story/news/politics/elections/presidential/2023/08/03/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-crowd-size-says-about-enthusiasm-gop-candidate-president-2024-election/70499355007/', 'Headline': ""What Trump's Erie rally crowd size says about enthusiasm for candidate"", 'Snippet': 'Then-Erie Bureau of Fire Chief Guy Santone estimated the 2018 rally attendance at about 9,000, a capacity crowd for the arena.

A photo of the empty seats accompanied the story.\n\nSo which is it? A ""massive, arena crowd record"" or a ""humiliating"" turnout in an arena where a ""ton"" of seats were left empty?\n\nThe answer is probably neither.\n\nHere\'s what we know, what we don\'t and other important details that provide context:\n\nErie Events Executive Director Gus Pine said the Trump campaign had control over event registration and entry security and therefore it was ""difficult"" for Erie Events, which manages the venue, ""to verify an exact count."" Pine, however, agreed with two Erie Insurance Arena ushers who provided a rough estimate of the crowd size, putting it at 4,500.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond when asked if it had an attendance figure of its own.\n\nThe capacity of the arena\n\nThat 4,500 figure is about half of what the arena holds when its capacity is maximized. For concerts, where there can be reserved seating or general admission floor tickets, the venue can hold about 9,000 spectators. For Erie Otters hockey games, Erie Insurance Arena can hold more than 6,800 people.\n\nPine said the venue was arranged for what amounted to a concert for Trump\'s speech.\n\nAs the Erie Times-News observed, Trump left several sections of the arena vacant. Only a smattering of people sat in Sections 101, 201, 102, 202, 103, 203, 122, 222, 121, 221, 120, and 220 — some of them were entirely empty. Sections 204, 205, 206, 207, 219 and 218 were half-full at best.\n\nMost of the floor seats were occupied, as were the sections of seats behind and to the left and right of where the stage was situated.\n\nPrevious appearances\n\nThe caption on the Gateway Pundit photo is false. Perhaps Trump drew a record crowd when he last spoke at Erie Insurance Arena on Oct. 10, 2018, weeks before a critical midterm election. Then-Erie Bureau of Fire Chief Guy Santone estimated the 2018 rally attendance at about 9,000, a capacity crowd for the arena. Not only that, the Erie Times-News reported that as many as 3,000 additional supporters who couldn\'t get into the arena watched the speech from a large screen on the front lawn.\n\nWhen he spoke at the venue on Aug. 12, 2016, more than 8,000 people attended his rally, which was held just weeks after he accepted the GOP nomination in Cleveland.\n\nLast stop\n\nPrior to July 29, Trump\'s most recent stop in Erie was on the tarmac of Erie International Airport on Oct. 20, 2020. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, it may have been Trump\'s largest audience in Erie. Thousands turned out to hear Trump speak, with Air Force Once as his backdrop, just two weeks before the Nov. 3 general election.\n\nRecord crowds\n\nAnd even though the playlist ahead of Trump\'s rally at Erie Insurance Arena included songs like ""Candle in the Wind,"" ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,"" ""Tiny Dancer"" and ""Rocket Man,"" Trump\'s estimated crowd size Saturday doesn\'t come close to replicating what the performer of those songs, Elton John, drew when he played the arena in 2013 (7,955) or 2000 (7,274). Nor would it match the crowd Barry Manilow drew in 1988 (6,039) or the audience for Cher in 2004 (5,857).\n\nOther factors\n\nTrump\'s appearance in Erie Saturday came early in the GOP primary for president, when a lot of voters haven\'t tuned into the presidential campaign let alone chosen a candidate. And those who have followed the campaign might be pulling for someone else, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is a very distant second to Trump in most polls. It was Trump\'s first visit to Erie with political opposition from within his own party.\n\nOverall, the July 29 rally was Trump\'s fourth in Erie. Perhaps the intrigue of seeing him speak has worn off for some. Maybe it was a forecast that called for high temperatures but delivered fog and rain instead.\n\nNot yet committed\n\nProfessor Joe Morris, chairman of the Political Science Department at Mercyhurst University, suspects that despite Trump\'s ability to draw large crowds, the former president might have an enthusiasm issue with some Republicans and independents now that he\'s been indicted twice by federal grand juries for his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving the White House and his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, which led to a four-count indictment Tuesday.\n\nTrump could soon be indicted by a grand jury in Georgia on election-related charges and he\'s already been charged in New York for an alleged hush-money scandal involving an adult film actress and others.\n\nVoters are split, he said, when it comes to a Trump-Biden rematch, according to most national polls. But in the Republican primary, some voters might not be ready for another four years of Trump.\n\n""Independents might feel, and even many Republicans might feel, that Donald Trump might not be the best choice, and they\'re not as firmly committed to his candidacy as they were, say, in 2016,"" Morris said.\n\nRecent polls, he said, suggest Trump, despite his sizable lead, might have an ""enthusiasm problem.""\n\n""There\'s a large percentage of even Republicans who are not enthusiastic about voting for Donald Trump, but they will do it if Joe Biden is the alternative,"" he said.\n\nBy comparison\n\nSo, did Trump draw a ""massive"" crowd to Erie on July 29?\n\nNot compared to past rallies, Morris said. But the businessman-turned-politician who\'s been twice impeached and now is under indictment in three criminal investigations retains his ""unique ability"" to draw large crowds.\n\nCould any other Republican or Democrat, including Biden, the sitting president, match Trump\'s Erie Insurance Arena turnout?\n\nNo, says Morris.\n\n""There\'s not another Republican or Democrat that can do what he can do,"" Morris said. ""And 4,500, if that is the number, that\'s still a good number, particularly with where we are in the election cycle. It\'s really impressive. But, again, the objective political scientist in me looking at polling data suggests that he does have an enthusiasm problem, at least by Donald Trump\'s standards.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/aug/08/viral-image/photo-claiming-massive-crowd-trumps-aug-5-wisconsi/', 'Headline': 'Photo claiming ‘massive’ crowd at Trump’s Aug. 5 Wisconsin rally is ...', 'Snippet': 'Social media posts shared a photo from Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign and claimed it was of an Aug. 5, 2022, rally in Wisconsin.

A lot of the people here probably were there. Jan. 6 was the largest crowd I’ve ever spoken to,” he told Collins. “That was prior to the walk down to the Capitol building. I’ve never spoken to a crowd as large as this, and that was because they thought the election was rigged.”\n\nTrump continued by claiming the crowd “had love in their heart.” Although it didn’t look like there was much love in the crowd when it descended on the Capitol building and attacked police officers who were protecting it.\n\n“They were there proud,” Trump said. “They were there with love in their heart. That was was unbelievable, and it was a beautiful day. And what I was asked to do. I wasn’t involved in it very much. I was asked to come in and would I make a speech. I made a speech and I said walk peacefully and patriotically.”\n\nThe former president then tried to blame former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for what happened that day, claiming she was “in charge of national security.”\n\nWhen asked why he didn’t tell his supporters to leave the Capitol sooner, Trump pulled out a printed list of his tweets he claimed were evidence that he had demanded peace during the Capitol riot. The former president failed to mention his infamous speech at his Stop the Steal rally that preceded the insurrection, in which he told the angry mob of Trump supporters to “fight like hell” or they wouldn’t “have a country anymore.”\n\nTrump, who was found liable for defamation and battery of E. Jean Carroll on Tuesday, opened the town hall by mocking the author. “I was very famous then and I owned the Plaza Hotel right next door and I owned the buildings around it — I’m not going into a dressing room of a crowded department store,” Trump retorted when asked about the recent verdict.\n\nTrending Stories\n\nThe former president also went on his usual rant of unfounded claims of election fraud Wednesday. Prior to CNN’s town hall, former Capitol Police officer Michael Fanone wrote in Rolling Stone, “Those lies persuaded thousands of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, violently attacking uniformed police officers and terrorizing members of Congress and their staff.

One police officer died, and several others took their own lives in the wake of that barbaric day.”\n\nLess than an hour after the event ended, the Biden campaign turned Trump’s words about Jan. 6 into a campaign ad.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/01/trump-rally-bubble-crowd-size/621292/', 'Headline': 'Why Trump Won’t Stop Talking About His Crowd Sizes - The Atlantic', 'Snippet': 'Before the 2020 election, Trump and his fans would often ask reporters how Joe Biden could possibly win when he didn’t have rallies as big as Trump’s. Now that Biden is president, Trump-rally ...', 'Full_text': 'You never know exactly what you’re going to get at a Trump rally—a creative variation on the “Lock her up” chant? A brand-new conspiracy theory? But you can always rely on the former president to brag about the size of the crowd. He will remark happily upon the gridlocked traffic getting into the event. He will exclaim that he cannot even pinpoint exactly where the crowd ends. And periodically, he will demand that videographers pivot their cameras around to capture the full extent of his devoted following.\n\nFor Donald Trump and his supporters, crowd size is more than just a bragging point. It’s proof that they are part of the American majority. “A person that comes here and has crowds that go further than the eye can see … and has cars that stretch out for 25 miles, that’s not somebody that lost an election,” Trump told the crowd at his rally in Florence, Arizona, on Saturday.\n\nBefore the 2020 election, Trump and his fans would often ask reporters how Joe Biden could possibly win when he didn’t have rallies as big as Trump’s. Now that Biden is president, Trump-rally goers say things like Trump couldn’t really have lost. Look at all of these people! In Arizona this weekend, 51-year-old Tammy Shutts put it this way to me: “100 percent, 1,000 percent, 1 million percent Biden didn’t win” her state, she said, gesturing to the hordes of people around her. “I’ve been in Arizona for almost 21 years. There is no way—no way—we went blue.”\n\nMany American liberals live in political bubbles. Some people in overwhelmingly blue parts of the country, for example, were shocked to find that Trump got so many votes in 2016. (“I live in a rather special world. I only know one person who voted for [Richard] Nixon,” the film critic Pauline Kael famously said of the former president, acknowledging her own political bubble just weeks after Nixon smashed George McGovern in 1972.) Some of those same blue-area Democrats were just as confident that Senator Elizabeth Warren would be the party nominee. But Republicans also live in bubbles.\n\nHuman beings aren’t particularly comfortable hearing information that challenges our closely held beliefs, and the urge to reject evidence that goes against our political opinions is especially strong. Reading only certain websites or watching particular TV channels shields Americans from facts and opinions they don’t like, and geographic sorting protects partisans from unpleasant interactions with people who hold different beliefs. Political segregation in America has increased dramatically in the past decade. “For about one in five Republicans, and two in five Democrats, less than a quarter of their neighbors belong to the opposite political party,” according to a recent study published in Nature. In other words, Trump voters might find it hard to believe that Biden won the election because their neighbors and friends mostly voted for Trump too.\n\nTrump’s rallies amplify these phenomena, Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard who co-wrote the Nature study, told me. “You have the president saying things, your neighbors who you [perceive as] saying the same things, and then these Trump rallies seem to be almost a social event,” he said. “Now you have an element of your social life, not just what you’re seeing on TV, that is caught up in believing these lies.” When you’re literally surrounded by believers, it’s hard to remember that doubters exist. Inside Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, for example, it can seem like the whole world is made up of Hawkeyes fans. Fortunately, that’s not true. (Go ’Clones.)'}}",100.0,3

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January. McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt.""'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/23/1145209559/jan-6-committee-final-report', 'Headline': 'The full January 6 report is out.

And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/trump-quote-jan-6-hearings-day-5/index.html', 'Headline': 'A damning Donald Trump quote you need to hear from Thursday’s January 6 ...', 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump said and did a whole lot of things on and around January 6, 2021, as he sought to use the levers of government to push his false election fraud schemes and remain in power.', 'Full_text': 'Donald Trump said and did a whole lot of things on and around January 6, 2021, as he sought to use the levers of government to push his false election fraud schemes and remain in power.\n\nNone was more damning than a quote that re-surfaced during the latest public hearing of the House select committee investigating January 6 on Thursday. It came from an extended phone call between Trump, acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue in December 2020.\n\nThe call, according to Donoghue, who took contemporaneous notes, featured the then-President repeatedly pressing the top Justice Department officials over a variety of false and conspiratorial claims about the election – all of which Donoghue shot down.\n\nAt some point during the call, Trump appears to grow exasperated. He implored Rosen and Donoghue to “just say that the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,” Donoghue testified Thursday.\n\nYeah. Think about that for a minute.\n\nThis is not the first time we have heard that line. CNN reported on the existence of Donoghue’s notes – and the Trump quote therein – in July 2021.\n\nBut in the context of the case being made by the January 6 committee, the quote is absolutely stunning and deeply revealing.\n\nConsider, first, the brazenness exhibited by Trump here. He is asking the two highest-ranking officials of the Justice Department at the time, who have already repeatedly made clear to him on the same call that his claims of election fraud are spurious, to just say that there was fraud – and be done with it.\n\nSecond, the quote reveals – or, in truth, re-reveals – the utter misunderstanding (and contempt) that Trump had for the Department of Justice.\n\nTime and time again, from the very early days of his time in office, Trump publicly expressed his frustrations that the DOJ would not simply do his bidding.\n\nTrump repeatedly wondered – via his Twitter feed and his own public comments – why his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had recused himself from the investigation into Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 election.\n\nIn an interview with Fox in August 2018, Trump asked, “What kind of man is this?” of Sessions, adding that he “never took control of the Justice Department.”\n\nTrump fired Sessions on the day after the 2018 election.\n\nDespite hand-picking Sessions’ successor, Bill Barr, Trump still complained the probe, led by special counsel John Durham, designed to look into the origins of the FBI’s Russia investigation was not moving quickly enough.\n\n“If that’s the case I think it’s terrible,” Trump told conservative radio show Rush Limbaugh in October 2020 when asked about the possibility that the Durham probe might not be released until after the election. “It’s very disappointing. And I’ll tell [Barr] to his face. I think it’s a disgrace. It’s an embarrassment.”\n\n(Worth noting: It wasn’t just the Department of Justice where Trump seemed to fundamentally misunderstand his power over them. He repeatedly referred to “my generals” and “my military.”)\n\nThe third thing the quote reveals is that Trump didn’t really care – in any meaningful way – whether or not there was actual election corruption. Remember that in the same phone call where Trump asks Rosen and Donoghue to “just say the election was corrupt,” he had told that the various claims he was making about election fraud were false.\n\nAll Trump cared about was using the imprimatur of the Justice Department as a shield by which he could then steer perception in favor of his election lies. In short: He knew what he was saying wasn’t born out by the facts. He didn’t care. He just wanted the DOJ to say “corrupt” so that he could meld and shape that for his own goal: staying in office no matter what.\n\nIt’s not clear yet whether the committee will recommend criminal charges at the end of all of this. Or whether the DOJ will charge Trump – or anyone else – in connection with their activities on January 6.\n\nBut what is clear is that Trump viewed the Justice Department as just another arm by which to carry out his agenda. He never knew or cared about the independence of DOJ, or why that was (and is) critical to the health of American democracy.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/factchecking-claims-about-the-jan-6-capitol-riot/', 'Headline': 'FactChecking Claims About the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot', 'Snippet': 'The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was the culmination of months of false claims about election fraud, including a litany recited by then-President Donald Trump in a speech shortly ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/01/us/trump-indictment-jan-6', 'Headline': 'Trump Indictment Jan. 6 Riot Was ‘Fueled by Lies’ From Trump, Special ...', 'Snippet': 'Trump Indictment Jan. 6 Riot Was ... journalists and the extensive investigation done by the Jan. 6 committee of the House. ... public comments on what happened, Mr. Trump described the day in ...', 'Full_text': '“Each of these conspiracies — which built on the widespread mistrust the defendant was creating through pervasive and destabilizing lies about election fraud — targeted a bedrock function of the United States federal government: the nation’s process of collecting, counting and certifying the results of the presidential election,” the indictment said.\n\nThe charges signify an extraordinary moment in United States history: a former president, in the midst of a campaign to return to the White House, being charged over attempts to use the levers of government power to subvert democracy and remain in office against the will of voters.\n\nIn sweeping terms, the indictment described how Mr. Trump and six co-conspirators employed a variety of means to reverse his defeat in the election almost from the moment that voting ended.\n\nIt depicted how Mr. Trump promoted false claims of fraud, sought to bend the Justice Department toward supporting those claims and oversaw a scheme to create false slates of electors pledged to him in states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. And it described how he ultimately pressured his vice president, Mike Pence, to use the fake electors to subvert the certification of the election at a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, that was cut short by the violence at the Capitol.\n\nThe indictment did not name the alleged co-conspirators, but the descriptions of their behavior match publicly known episodes involving prominent people around Mr. Trump.\n\nThe behavior of “Co-conspirator 1” appears to align with that of Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer whom he put in charge of efforts to deny the transfer of power after his main campaign lawyers made clear it was over. Mr. Giuliani’s lawyer, Robert J. Costello, acknowledged in a statement that it “appears that Mayor Giuliani is alleged to be co-conspirator No. 1.”\n\nThe description of “Co-conspirator 2” tracks closely with that of John Eastman, a California law professor who served as the architect of the plan to pressure Mr. Pence.\n\nThe co-conspirators could be charged at any point, and their inclusion in the indictment — even unnamed — places pressure on them to cooperate with investigators.\n\nMany of the details in the charges were familiar, having appeared either in news accounts or in the work of the House select committee investigating Jan. 6. There were descriptions of Mr. Trump’s attempt to install a loyalist, Jeffrey Clark, who appears to be a co-conspirator in the case, atop the Justice Department and to strong-arm the secretary of state of Georgia into finding him enough votes to win the election in that state.\n\nThere were also references to Mr. Trump posting a message on Twitter in mid-December 2020 calling for a “wild” protest in Washington on Jan. 6, and to him pressuring Mr. Pence to try to throw the election his way during the joint session of Congress that day.\n\nBut the indictment also contained some snippets of new information, such as a description of Mr. Trump telling Mr. Pence, “You’re too honest,” as the vice president pushed back on Mr. Trump’s pressure to interfere in the certification of Mr. Biden’s victory.\n\nIt also included an account of Mr. Trump telling someone who asked if he wanted additional pressure put on Mr. Pence that “no one” else but him needed to speak with the vice president.\n\nMr. Smith, in drafting his charging document, walked a cautious path in connecting Mr. Trump to the mob attack on the Capitol. The indictment mentioned Mr. Trump’s “exploitation of the violence and chaos” at the building that day, but did not accuse him of inciting the riot.\n\nIt also laid out how Mr. Trump was repeatedly told by multiple people, including top officials in his campaign and at the Justice Department, that he had lost the election and that his claims that he had been cheated were false. That sort of evidence could help prosecutors prove their accusations by establishing Mr. Trump’s intent.\n\nMr. Trump’s constant claims of widespread election fraud “were false, and the defendant knew they were false,” the indictment said, adding that he was told repeatedly that his assertions were untrue.\n\n“Despite having lost, the defendant was determined to remain in power,” the indictment said.\n\nMr. Trump has been summoned for his initial court appearance in the case on Thursday afternoon before a magistrate judge in Federal District Court in Washington, the special counsel’s office said. Ultimately, a trial date and a schedule for pretrial motions will be set, proceedings that are likely to extend well into the presidential campaign.\n\nMr. Trump’s lead lawyer on the case, John Lauro, laid out what appeared to be the beginning of his defense, telling Fox News, “I would like them to try to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Donald Trump believed that these allegations” about voter fraud “were false.”\n\nThe charges in the case came more than two and a half years after a pro-Trump mob — egged on by incendiary speeches by Mr. Trump and his allies — stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in the worst attack on the seat of Congress since the War of 1812.\n\nThey also came a little more than seven months after Attorney General Merrick B. Garland appointed Mr. Smith, a career federal prosecutor, to oversee both the election tampering and classified documents inquiries into Mr. Trump. They followed a series of high-profile hearings last year by the House Jan. 6 committee, which laid out extensive evidence of Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse the election results.\n\nMr. Garland moved to name Mr. Smith as special counsel in November, just days after Mr. Trump declared that he was running for president again.\n\nIn a brief appearance before reporters, Mr. Smith set out what he said was the former president’s moral, as well as legal, responsibility for violence at the Capitol, saying the riot was “fueled by lies” — Mr. Trump’s lies.\n\nMr. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, has incorporated attacking the investigations into his campaign messaging and fund-raising. His advisers have been blunt in private conversations that they see his winning the election as crucial to undoing the charges against him.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Trump denounced the indictment.\n\n“Why did they wait two and a half years to bring these fake charges, right in the middle of President Trump’s winning campaign for 2024?” he said, calling it “election interference” and comparing the Biden administration to Nazi Germany.\n\nThe judge assigned to Mr. Trump’s case, Tanya S. Chutkan, has been a tough jurist in cases against Jan. 6 rioters — and in a case that involved Mr. Trump directly. Appointed by President Barack Obama, she has routinely issued harsh penalties against people who stormed the Capitol.\n\nShe also denied Mr. Trump’s attempt to avoid disclosing documents to the Jan. 6 committee, ordering him to turn over the material and writing, “Presidents are not kings.”\n\nMr. Trump now faces two separate federal indictments. In June, Mr. Smith brought charges in Florida accusing Mr. Trump of illegally holding on to a highly sensitive trove of national defense documents and then obstructing the government’s attempts to get them back.\n\nThe scheme charged by Mr. Smith on Tuesday in the election case played out largely in the two months between Election Day in 2020 and the attack on the Capitol. During that period, Mr. Trump took part in a range of efforts to retain power despite having lost the presidential race.\n\nIn addition to federal charges in the election and documents cases, Mr. Trump also faces legal troubles in state courts.\n\nHe has been charged by the Manhattan district attorney’s office in a case that centers on hush money payments made to the porn actress Stormy Daniels in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\nThe efforts by Mr. Trump and his allies to reverse his election loss are also the focus of a separate investigation by the district attorney in Fulton County, Ga. That inquiry appears likely to generate charges this month.\n\nIt seems likely that Mr. Trump will face the prospect of at least three criminal trials next year, even as he is campaigning for the presidency. The Manhattan trial is scheduled to begin in March, while the federal documents case in Florida is set to go to trial in May.\n\nGlenn Thrush contributed reporting.\n\nThe indictment of the former president for trying to subvert democracy — an episode that has no precedent in American history — was issued by a federal grand jury in Washington and unsealed shortly before Mr. Smith gave his statement.\n\nMr. Trump has been charged with four crimes, including conspiracies to defraud the United States and to obstruct an official proceeding.\n\nHere are four takeaways:\n\nThe indictment portrays an attack on American democracy.\n\nMr. Smith framed his case against Mr. Trump as one that cuts to a core function of democracy: the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBy underscoring this theme, which he also laid out in the indictment, Mr. Smith cast his effort as not just an effort to hold Mr. Trump accountable but also to defend the very core of democracy.\n\nMr. Smith said the former president’s efforts to overturn the election went well beyond his First Amendment right to make claims about voter fraud. The indictment details Mr. Trump’s efforts to use the machinery of government — including his own Justice Department — to help him cling to power.\n\nTrump was placed at the center of the conspiracy.\n\nMr. Smith puts Mr. Trump at the heart of three overlapping conspiracies.\n\nThese conspiracies culminated on Jan. 6, 2021, as an attempt to obstruct Congress’s role in ratifying the Electoral College outcome.\n\nMr. Smith argued in the indictment that Mr. Trump knew his claims about a stolen election were false. He cited a litany of episodes in which campaign advisers, White House officials, top Justice Department lawyers, speakers of statehouses and election administrators all told Mr. Trump his claims about “outcome-determinative fraud” in the election were false. Mr. Trump nonetheless kept repeating them.\n\nEstablishing that Mr. Trump knew he was lying could be important to convincing a jury to convict him. A lawyer for Mr. Trump has already signaled that his defense could rest in part on showing that he truly believed he had been cheated out of re-election.\n\nTrump didn’t do it alone.\n\nThe indictment lists six co-conspirators, without naming or indicting them.\n\nBased on the descriptions provided of the co-conspirators, they match the profiles of a crew of outside lawyers and advisers that Mr. Trump turned to after his campaign and White House lawyers failed to turn up credible evidence of fraud and had lost dozens of cases to challenge the election results in swing states.\n\nAfter many of his core advisers told him his claims of fraud weren’t bearing out, Mr. Trump turned to lawyers who were willing to argue ever more outlandish conspiracy and legal theories to keep him in power.\n\nThese advisers included Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York; the constitutional lawyer John Eastman, who came up with the scheme to pressure Mr. Pence to block the certification of election results on Jan. 6; and Sidney Powell, the lawyer who pushed the theory that foreign nations had hacked into voting machines. Even Mr. Trump told advisers at the time that Ms. Powell’s theories sounded “crazy,” but he kept repeating them in public.\n\nIt’s unclear whether any or all of these co-conspirators will be indicted or whether they now have a period in which there’s an opportunity for them to decide to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nIndictments have only strengthened Trump’s hold on the Republican Party.\n\nMr. Trump may be on trial next year in three or four separate criminal cases — and there’s no telling what effect that might have on his general election prospects if he’s the Republican nominee. So far, the indictments appear to have had nothing but political upside for the former president.\n\nThe criminal investigations have helped consolidate Mr. Trump’s position as his party’s overwhelming front-runner in the presidential primaries.\n\nThe latest charges were Mr. Trump’s third indictment since early April. In the four months since his first indictment in New York, Mr. Trump has gained nearly 10 percentage points, according to national polling averages. During that same period, his closest rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, has seen his support drop to the point where he now lags Mr. Trump nationally by more than 30 percentage points and is far behind in all the early voting states.\n\nTo understand the depths of frustration that Mr. Trump’s presidential rivals are wallowing in as they helplessly watch a Republican electorate in thrall to the former president, consider a single data point from this week’s New York Times/Siena College poll.\n\n“In a head-to-head contest with Mr. DeSantis,” The Times wrote, “Mr. Trump still received 22 percent among voters who believe he has committed serious federal crimes — a greater share than the 17 percent that Mr. DeSantis earned from the entire G.O.P. electorate.”\n\nIf Mr. Trump does well among Republican voters who already think he’s a criminal, what hope do his G.O.P. opponents have of exploiting this latest indictment?\n\nIn New York, he is accused of falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment while the special counsel, Jack Smith, also previously accused Mr. Trump of mishandling national security secrets.\n\nWere a federal case to still be pending on Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump could simply use his power as president to force the Justice Department to drop the matter, as he has suggested he might do.\n\n(It is not yet clear when a trial over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election will start. The classified documents case, which will be tried in Florida, has a date set for May, but that could change depending on how pretrial arguments unfold.)\n\nBut the Constitution does not give presidents supervisory authority over state prosecutors, so that would not work for the state inquiries in New York and Georgia, where the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, has indicated she is nearing a decision on charges in her own election-interference investigation.\n\nThe most Mr. Trump could probably do is try to delay a trial over any state charges that may be pending. In the past, the Justice Department has taken the position that criminal legal proceedings against a president while he is in office would be unconstitutional because it would interfere with his ability to perform his duties.\n\nThere is no definitive Supreme Court ruling on the matter because the issue has never arisen before. In 1997, the Supreme Court allowed a federal lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed while he was in office — but that was a civil case, not a criminal one.\n\nMr. Trump’s trial in New York on charges of bookkeeping fraud is scheduled to begin in March. The timing of any trial in Georgia is an open question.\n\nIf Mr. Trump were to be convicted in one or more cases, he is almost certain to pursue appeals, delaying any sentencing and all but ensuring he is not incarcerated by Inauguration Day. The question would then arise of what would happen if he took office for a second term.\n\nShould Mr. Trump be convicted in a federal case, he would likely then move to pardon himself, a power he claimed in 2018 that he had the “absolute right” to wield. It is not clear whether a self-pardon would be legitimate.\n\nNo text in the Constitution bars a president from doing so. But in 1974, the Justice Department issued a terse legal opinion stating that President Richard Nixon did not appear to have the authority to pardon himself “under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.”\n\nBut the opinion did not explain what transformed that principle into an unwritten limit on the power the Constitution bestows on presidents. Legal experts have disagreed on that question, but no president has ever claimed he was pardoning himself, so it has never been tested in court.\n\nIn such a scenario, Mr. Trump is almost certain to use his control of the Justice Department to ensure that it sides with him on whether a self-pardon is legitimate. If prosecutors do not challenge a self-pardon, it is not clear who else would have legal standing to pursue the matter.\n\nShould Mr. Trump be convicted in New York or Georgia, he could not pardon himself because the Constitution does not empower a president to forgive state offenses. That is instead a power wielded by governors. If the relevant governor did not pardon him, he could seek a federal court order delaying any incarceration — or requiring his release from prison — while he is the sitting president, on constitutional grounds.\n\nYet another possibility is that if he is incarcerated, upon the start of his second term, he could be removed from office under the 25th Amendment as “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”\n\nBut that outcome would require the majority of a president’s cabinet, along with the vice president, to make such a determination. Among the questions that possibility would raise is who would qualify as a cabinet member if the Senate has not confirmed any new political appointees by Mr. Trump.\n\n“These un-American witch hunts will fail and President Trump will be re-elected to the White House so he can save our country from the abuse, incompetence and corruption that is running through the veins of our country at levels never seen before,” the Trump campaign said in the statement.\n\nThe line of attack by Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner for president, was a familiar one. It dates back to at least 2017, when he began alluding to a “deep state” plot by the Justice Department.\n\nBack then, he was fixated on Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server to store classified material and questioned why his opponent in the 2016 election had not been criminally charged.\n\n“Why aren’t our deep State authorities looking at this?” Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Twitter in November 2017, tagging Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. “Rigged & corrupt?”\n\nThe term “deep state” had appeared to be a riff on remarks that Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, made just after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Mr. Bannon, at a conservative gathering, said that the “deconstruction of the administrative state” was underway.\n\nBut as Mr. Trump’s own grip on power became threatened — by his first impeachment in 2019 and a two-year investigation into Russian election meddling — he broadened the narrative. His campaign speeches became peppered with accusations that career civil servants had conspired to undermine his presidency. His rhetoric became more vitriolic, calling those officials “absolute scum” and comparing them to Nazis. His campaign invoked “Nazi Germany” again on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Trump was so consumed with conspiracy theories about the “deep state” that his administration weeded out Cabinet members and career civil servants it deemed to be disloyal at prolific rates. Scores left under their own volition.\n\nBy one account, the Trump administration had lost nearly 1,200 senior career service employees in its first 18 months — roughly 40 percent more than during President Barack Obama’s first 18 months in office.\n\nHe relied on the narrative again when he was impeached a second time after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAnd now, with criminal indictments against him piling up as he seeks to return to the White House, he has further demonized the federal government. He has characterized each successive indictment as examples of the Justice Department being weaponized against him, pivoting from the broader “deep state” conspiracy to one aimed squarely at the Democrats now in power.\n\nHis Republican rivals have largely echoed his narrative. “As President, I will end the weaponization of government,” Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Mr. Trump’s top 2024 rival, said on Twitter moments after the third indictment was announced on Tuesday.\n\nAnd his allies in Congress and conservative media have always been quick to adopt his talking points. At times, they also cast themselves as victims of the “deep state.”\n\nAn example: In 2018, Representative Jim Jordan, the House Freedom Caucus firebrand, blamed liberal bureaucrats in the government amid criticism that he had failed to report sexual misconduct at Ohio State University while he was a wrestling coach there.\n\nMr. Jordan is now chairman of a House subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government, which Republicans created this year.\n\nThough none have gone as far as him, Mr. Trump is not the first politician who has sought to discredit the Justice Department, which includes the F.B.I., often as the walls of justice closed in on them.\n\nAs his presidency began to unravel in 1974, Richard M. Nixon warned the Justice Department to back off its investigation into Watergate, when a White House “plumbers” unit broke into the Democratic National Committee’s offices in Washington, D.C. He resigned about four months later.\n\nRepublicans cried foul when, four days before the 1992 presidential election, a special prosecutor brought an additional one-count indictment against Caspar W. Weinberger, the former defense secretary, accusing him of lying to Congress about the Iran-contra Affair. President George H.W. Bush’s G.O.P. allies blamed the timing of the indictment for his defeat by the Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. Mr. Bush had been vice president in the Reagan administration during the scandal.\n\nDemocrats and President Bill Clinton’s lawyer relentlessly attacked the impartiality of Ken Starr, the independent counsel who led the investigation into the president’s affair with Monica Lewinsky, during impeachment proceedings in 1998. They accused him of “overkill” and claimed he was leaking information to the news media. At the request of the Justice Department, his oversight role had been expanded from beyond his initial inquiry into the Whitewater deal. Mr. Clinton was impeached mostly along party lines in the House, but acquitted by the Senate.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/07/22/1112323797/jan-6-hearing-recap-187-minutes', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 panel details what Trump did — and did not do - NPR', 'Snippet': ""Here's every word from the 8th Jan. 6 committee on its investigation. ... earlier that day and did not comment on the violence. ...

Elaine Luria, D-Va., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., used witness testimony to piece together Trump\'s actions the afternoon of Jan. 6, as there was not an official call log from the White House that afternoon and nothing included in the presidential daily diary.\n\n""The chief White House photographer wanted to take pictures because it was, in her words, \'very important for his archives and for history.\' But she was told: \'no photographs\',"" Luria said.\n\nWhite House counsel and White House officials testified that Trump did not make any calls to the secretary of defense, the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security during the siege.\n\nAlthough the White House call logs are empty, Trump lawyer and ally Rudy Giuliani\'s call logs show at least two calls between him and the president that day. The committee also noted that other Trump calls that day are known, including several to Republican senators to urge them to delay the certification of Biden\'s win.\n\n\'I\'ve seen the impact that his words have on his supporters\'\n\nA major theme from the hearing was how much television the former president consumed as the chaos and violence unfolded.\n\n""President Trump sat in his dining room and watched the attack on television while his senior-most staff closest advisers and family members begged him to do what is expected of any American president,"" Luria said. ""When lives and our democracy hung in the balance, President Trump refused to act because of his selfish desire to stay in power.""\n\nThe committee played video clips of news coverage from Fox News, to show what Trump watched in real time as he tuned in from his dining room, just off from the Oval Office. He watched as his supporters, donning red caps and chanting his name, overwhelmed and outnumbered police as they flooded the Capitol grounds and attempted to breach the Capitol.\n\nAt 1:49 p.m. ET, just as D.C. police were declaring a riot at the Capitol, Trump tweeted out a video of his speech at the Ellipse earlier that day and did not comment on the violence.\n\nKizinger noted that between 1:49 and 2:24, when Trump posted a subsequent tweet, ""staff repeatedly came into the room to see him and plead that he make a strong public statement condemning the violence and instructing the mob to leave the Capitol.""\n\nThe panel shared video testimony from top advisers and his children imploring Trump to call off the attack.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, a former White House staffer, has previously testified to a conversation between White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\n""I remember [Cipollone] saying something to the effect of, \'Mark we need to do something more.

""They truly latch on to every word and every tweet that he says, and so I think that in that moment for him to tweet out the message about Mike Pence, it was him pouring gasoline on the fire,"" she said.\n\nMatthews said White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her ""in a hushed tone"" that Trump ""did not want to include any sort of mention of peace in that tweet.""\n\nShe said McEnany told her ""it took some convincing on their part those who were in the room and she said that there was a back and forth going over different phrases to find something that he was comfortable with, and it wasn\'t until Ivanka Trump suggested the phrase \'stay peaceful\', that he finally agreed to include it.""\n\nPottinger said he was ""disturbed"" by Trump\'s tweet attacking Pence and that it was ""the opposite of what we really needed in that moment which was a de-escalation.""\n\nThe panel described one of Trump\'s final interactions on Jan. 6, as he departed the White House dining room at 6:27 p.m. ET to go to the residence.\n\n""As he was gathering his things in the dining room to leave, President Trump reflected on the day\'s events with an unnamed White House employee,"" Kinzinger said, adding the employee recalled Trump saying: ""Mike Pence let me down.""\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIn his closing statement, Kinzinger said Trump abandoned his responsibilities as commander-in-chief on Jan. 6.\n\n""Whatever your politics, whatever you think about the outcome of the election, we as Americans must all agree on this: Donald Trump\'s conduct on Jan. 6 was a supreme violation of his oath of office and a complete dereliction of his duty to our nation,"" he said.

Here are some of the key takeaways:', 'Full_text': 'These are the key takeaways from the Jan. 6 committee\'s final public session\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee used its final public meeting Monday to summarize its 17-month investigation with a simple closing statement: All roads lead to Donald Trump.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\n\nThe committee refers Trump to the DOJ\n\nFor months, the committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. On Monday, the committee didn’t equivocate.\n\nThe committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary, released after the meeting, it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nIn practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nBut the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department’s court.\n\nAll roads lead to Trump\n\nCommittee members repeatedly pointed to Trump’s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6.\n\nMonday’s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break “the foundation of American democracy.” Members stressed that Trump knew the election was not stolen but continued to push baseless claims about widespread voter fraud in an effort to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory.\n\nVisually reinforcing their argument\n\nThe committee relied once again on video — an effective and memorable tool the panel has used throughout its hearings with closed-door witness testimony and harrowing scenes from the violent attack on the Capitol, to make an its case against Trump.\n\nThe montage went step-by-step through Trump’s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters.\n\nA bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor\n\nThough GOP lawmakers have called the committee partisan, the panel is, in fact, bipartisan.\n\nTwo Republicans who volunteered to join the committee: Rep. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. They both brought GOP staff members along with them who worked for the committee.\n\nTo be sure, Cheney and Kinzinger are outliers in their caucus because they are anti-Trump. And that is the core of Trump’s critiques of the committee — that it stacked with Trump haters. Still, even if they oppose Trump, Cheney and Kinzinger are still deeply conservative Republicans.\n\nNo matter what Trump and his allies say, Democrats will forever be able to accurately assert that the panel’s findings, conclusions, its final report and its criminal referrals are bipartisan.\n\nRead more takeaways here\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee had its last public meeting today. Here\'s what happens next.\n\nThe end is near — at least for the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nThe panel held its final public session Monday where it voted on its final report and approved a criminal referral for several charges against former President Donald Trump.\n\nSo here’s what happens next: Committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the full report will come out Wednesday. This will be a historical document that will be studied for generations — never before has a sitting president tried to steal a second term.\n\nAdditional “transcripts and documents” will be released before the end of the year, Thompson said.\n\nThe sheer volume of this material can’t be overstated. The panel interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, likely generating tens of thousands of pages of transcripts. Many of these interviews were filmed, which means the panel has hundreds of hours of footage that it might release very soon.\n\nThese upcoming releases will provide fodder to Trump’s critics. But it will also grant a key demand from some of Trump’s allies — that the panel disclose the full context of its interviews. Up until this point, the panel has been very selective about which snippets of witness interviews got played at public hearings.\n\nThe current Congress ends on January 3, 2023, and that’s when the committee will cease to exist. But the Justice Department investigation, overseen by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by US Attorney General Merrick Garland, continues.\n\nOf the committee’s nine members, four won’t be returning to Congress. Besides Republican vice-chair Rep. Liz Cheney and Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida is retiring, and Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia was one of the handful of House Democratic incumbents who lost their seats in the 2022 midterms last month.\n\n""We ended up in the middle"": Rep. Jamie Raskin explains how the committee made criminal referral selections\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who serves on the subcommittee of the Jan. 6 select committee responsible for presenting criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, laid out how panel members arrived at the decisions presented during Monday’s final public session.\n\nAsked about process offenses, such as witness tampering or perjury, Raskin said “as evidence is assembled about that, I hope that those will be charged as well. You cannot suborn perjury, you cannot obstruct justice, you cannot interfere with a congressional proceeding.” However, Raskin did not specify who these potential charges related to in the panel’s investigation.\n\nIn terms of unanswered questions left by the committee, Raskin was asked if the panel ever solved the situation with the pipe bombs on Jan. 6 and said, “I don’t believe there have been any updates since we first looked int to. Those are unsolved crimes.”\n\nIn pictures: Scenes from the last public Jan. 6 committee meeting\n\nCheck out photos from the last Jan. 6 hearings here.\n\nCommittee members Schiff and Raskin explain why more Trump associates were not referred to the DOJ\n\nJan. 6 committee members, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Adam Schiff, explained that more associates of former President Donald Trump were not directly referred to the Department of Justice because the committee wanted to focus on those with “abundant evidence” against them.\n\nRaskin noted that the DOJ will receive the full report and can decide if anyone else discussed merits further investigation.\n\n“We wanted to proceed in such a way that we could all feel certain that these were people where evidence exists that they engaged in criminal offenses against our country,” he added.\n\nSchiff said, “The long and the short of it is we possess evidence that up until this release, the Justice Department may not have, they possess evidence that we don’t have, and the cumulative impact of all that evidence will hopefully lead to justice for those that have broken the law here.”\n\nRaskin promised that they would cooperate with the Justice Department “quickly,” while Schiff added that the committee expects evidence will start to be made available to both the DOJ and the public starting Wednesday.\n\nAsked to explain why those four House Republicans were referred to House Ethics in particular, Schiff pointed out that these four failed to comply with a congressional subpoena, which is easier to prove.\n\nHere\'s a recap of what happened at the Jan. 6 committee\'s final public session\n\nAfter extensive investigation, the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol held its final public meeting Monday where they voted on their final report and approved a series of criminal referrals — including against former President Donald Trump and others in his orbit.\n\nThe final report is expected to be released publicly Wednesday.\n\nHere are the key things that happened at the committee’s last public session:\n\nTrump’s role in the events of Jan. 6: The committee announced it will refer several criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including obstructing an official proceeding, defrauding the United States, making false statements and assisting or aiding an insurrection.The DOJ special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into Jan. 6. The referrals are largely symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes.\n\nFinal report: Members voted to approve their final report, which will include a bulk of results from the 17-month investigation, chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said during his opening remarks. An executive summary of the report was released after Monday’s meeting, but the full report won’t be available to the public until Wednesday.\n\nA spanning investigation: During the meeting, the committee played a video summarizing its investigation. Since its formation in July 2021, the panel conducted more than 1,000 interviews as well as issued subpoenas and court battles to obtain hundreds of thousands of documents. The committee said the evidence shows that Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nClosing remarks from the committee: Though its investigation is coming to a close, Thompson reiterated the importance of preventing another insurrection from happening again, for the sake of American democracy. “I believe nearly two years later, this is still a time of reflection and reckoning,” he said. “If we are to survive as a nation of laws and democracy, this can never happen again.” Thompson said the most important thing in preventing another event like Jan. 6 is accountability. The committee’s vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, said Trump was “unfit for any office.”\n\nOfficers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 were sitting in the front row during committee meeting\n\nAs the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 riot held its last public meeting, the room was packed.\n\nLaw enforcement officers who testified at the panel’s first public hearing last July about the violence they experienced defending the US Capitol on Jan. 6 sat in the front row, as they have for every public event the committee has had.\n\nThose officers include: US Capitol Police (USCP) officer Harry Dunn, former Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, former USCP Sgt. Aquilino Gonell and Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges.\n\nFanone sat in the audience as the panel replayed his testimony about being attacked as the riot unfolded.\n\nA number of committee staff and investigators — and even former GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, who has publicly supported the panel’s work — were in the audience as well.\n\nThe meeting took place in the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caucus Room which was recently renamed to honor House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who stepping down as speaker at the end of the this Congress.\n\nIn previous hearings, it was typical to see a committee staffer sitting at the dais with the members. But for today’s meeting, it was just the nine committee members at the dais, each taking turns speaking.\n\nJan. 6 committee chair says he\'s ""convinced"" Trump will be charged by DOJ with help of panel\'s evidence\n\nJan. 6 committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the evidence that supports the panel’s decision to refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for several criminal charges is “clear,” adding that he is “convinced” that the DOJ will ultimately charge Trump.\n\n“The committee looked at it long and hard, and from my vantage point, we couldn’t do anything except make the referral,” Thompson told CNN after Monday’s meeting, acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the referral.\n\n“It was clear in the evaluation of the evidence uncovered by our committee that those actions taken by the president… former President Trump, clearly created a problem for this country,” he added.\n\nThe committee also voted to approve its final report which will be released to the public Wednesday. That report will contain most of the evidence from the 17-month long investigation — including full transcripts from more than 1,000 interviews.\n\n“We think it’s important for the Justice Department to look at that body of information that we put together,” he said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n1c447b21-7492-487d-bf20-bbd9f8559559.mp4\n\n01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nKellyanne Conway testified that Trump described rioters as ""upset"" the day after the attack\n\nTrump “minimized the seriousness of the attack” in the days following the riot, Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Elaine Luria said, specifically citing testimony that Trump’s former senior adviser Kellyanne Conway gave to the committee.\n\nAsked to describe her conversation with Trump the day after the riot, Conway, said she didn’t think it was very long. “I don’t think it was very long. I just said that was just a terrible day.”\n\nTrump, Conway said, responded to her saying, “These people are upset. They’re very upset.”\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump similarly described rioters as being “upset” during a heated phone call he had with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy while the insurrection was underway, claiming the rioters cared more about the election results than the California Republican did.\n\n“Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,” Trump said, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call afterward by McCarthy.\n\nTrump’s comment set off what GOP lawmakers familiar with the call described as a shouting match between the two men. A furious McCarthy told Trump the rioters were breaking into his office through the windows, and asked, “Who the f–k do you think you are talking to?” according to a Republican lawmaker familiar with the call.\n\nTrump was warned of violence before Jan. 6, but refused to encourage peaceful protest\n\nIn the lead up to Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Donald Trump ignored warnings from advisors about the potential for violence and rejected any suggestion that he should explicitly tell supporters to be peaceful, Rep. Stephanie Murphy said Monday.\n\nMurphy pointed to a text message exchange provided to the committee by Hope Hicks, Trump’s former communications director. In the exchange, Hicks and then White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley discussed getting Trump to tweet out a message to his supporters. Gidley texted Hicks that Trump “really should tweet something about Being NON-violent.”\n\nHicks responded that she had already “suggested it several times” without success.\n\n“Mr. Herschmann said that he had made the same recommendation directly to the President and that he had refused,” Hicks said in her interview with the committee, a video of which was played Monday.\n\nDespite his staff’s warnings, Murphy said, Trump took to the stage on Jan. 6, 2021, and encouraged his supporters to “fight like hell,” and sent them marching to the Capitol building.\n\nNOW: Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral against Trump and other officials\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral it plans to make against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department and other officials.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee would refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the committee, told CNN last week that a subcommittee of members would make recommendations to the full committee about various referrals.\n\nThe full committee is now expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nRemember: A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case. With the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nJan. 6 committee concerned lawyer took part in attempt to keep truth from them, Lofgren says\n\nHouse Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren revealed during Monday’s public meeting that an unnamed lawyer appeared to have attempted to shape the testimony of one witness in a way that could help Donald Trump.\n\nLofgren noted a lawyer suggested that the witness not share some memories during her testimony to the committee, that she couldn’t learn who was paying for her lawyer, and that Trump-allied entities offered to keep her under their wing as her testimony neared.\n\nAs it became clear what the witness would say, Lofgren added, the job offers evaporated.\n\nLofgren didn’t name the lawyer or the female witness, and it’s not clear if all of the examples are about one witness.\n\nIt’s not unusual or illegal for lawyers to take money from motivated backers to pay for witnesses to be represented. But lawyers must follow strict ethics guidelines, governed by their state bars and enforced by the courts. The House select committee previously shared their concerns about potential witness influence with the Justice Department.\n\nFormer Trump aide Hope Hicks describes conversation with Trump saying the only thing that matters is winning\n\nIn a new video clip played by the House Jan. 6 committee, Hope Hicks, who previously served as a top aide to former President Donald Trump, referenced the baseless claims of election fraud and said: “I was becoming increasingly concerned that … we were damaging his legacy.”\n\nTrump “said something along the lines of, you know, ‘Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,’” Hicks said in the clip.\n\nThe committee played the clip after Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren said Trump was repeatedly told there was no evidence to back up his false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, and the panel “has obtained testimony from new witnesses who have come forward to tell us about their conversations with ex-President Trump on this topic.”\n\n“Donald Trump knowingly and corruptly repeated election fraud lies, which incited his supporters to violence on Jan. 6. He continues to repeat his meritless claim that the election was stolen even today, and continues to erode our most cherished and shared belief in free and fair elections,” Lofgren later continued.\n\nKinzinger calls out fellow Republicans for their role in Trump’s DOJ schemes\n\nGOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the two Republicans on the the Jan. 6 committee, accused former president Donald Trump of trying to abuse the powers of the Justice Department so he could stay in office.\n\nKinzinger described how Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to publicly endorse his false claims about massive voter fraud. As part of the plan, Trump wanted them to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,” according to committee testimony.\n\nA retiring Republican, Kinzinger called out his fellow GOP lawmakers. He also specifically name-dropped Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, who was involved with some of Trump’s scheming at the Justice Department.\n\nWhen then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to go along with Trump’s plan, Trump almost fired him and replaced him with Jeffrey Clark, a Trump loyalist at DOJ who embraced his election lies.\n\n“It was only after the threat of mass resignations that President Trump rescinded his offer to Mr. Clark,” Kinzinger said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\ncc4283b8-e6ad-44ea-8cac-93d9dcbf8029.mp4\n\n04:42 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump ""oversaw"" legally dubious fake electors plot, Jan. 6 committee says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump “oversaw” an effort to obtain and transmit false Electoral College certificates, tying him directly to a core tenet of the broader plot to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory in key swing states, the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection said Monday.\n\nThe panel highlighted Trump’s personal involvement in the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost, arguing that the evidence shows he actively worked to “transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives.”\n\nThose certificates, which surfaced publicly earlier this year, helped spark criminal investigations into the Trump team’s attempt to subvert the Electoral College.\n\nAs part of its closing message Monday, the select committee emphasized that these “false ballots” were created despite concerns among Trump’s election lawyers and White House counsel that doing so may be “unlawful.”\n\n“In spite of these concerns, and the concerns of individuals in the White House Counsel’s Office, President Trump and others proceeded with this plan,” he added.\n\nThe committee has evidence that shows these “intentionally false” Electoral College certificates were “transmitted to multiple officers of the federal government,” according to Schiff.\n\nEvidence collected by the committee also shows these documents “were intended to interfere with the proper conduct of the joint session, where the existence of so-called ‘competing slates’ of electors would serve as a pretext for legitimate electoral votes to be rejected,” he added.\n\nCheney: Trump ""is unfit for any office""\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the committee, issued a scathing rebuke of former President Donald Trump during her opening remarks on Monday, saying he is unfit for office based on his actions regarding Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\n“At the beginning of our investigation, we understood that tens of millions of Americans had been persuaded by President Trump that the 2020 election was stolen by overwhelming fraud. And we also knew this was flatly false. We knew that dozens of state and federal judges had addressed and resolved all manner of allegations about the election,” Cheney said. “Our legal system functioned as it should. But our president would not accept the outcome. Among the most shameful of this committee’s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television.”\n\nShe went on to describe how Trump was unmoved by “urgent pleas” from people around him to “issue a public statement instructing his supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol,” even as rioters attacked law enforcement officials and halted the electoral count.\n\n“In addition to being unlawful as described in our report, this was an utter moral failure, and a clear dereliction of duty,” Cheney added.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney: ""At the heart of our Republic is the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power""\n\nGOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection on the US Capitol, said the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power is “at the heart of our Republic.”\n\nShe added: “Trumbull called this ‘one of the highest moral lessons ever given the world.’ With this noble act, George Washington established the indispensable example of the peace transfer of power in our nation.”\n\nShe traced this orderly transfer of power through every president of the United States until former President Donald Trump refused his constitutional duty.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nfb900dba-c57b-4545-9654-1fd8f5848d90.mp4\n\n05:07 - Source: CNN\n\nThompson: It\'s up to the people of America to decide who deserves the public\'s trust\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said that the future of democracy rests on the hands of the American public during his opening statement at Monday’s public meeting.\n\nHe also thanked the American public for tuning into the committee’s hearings and said that he hoped that the evidence presented lived up to their expectations.\n\n“I’m grateful to the millions of you who followed this committee’s work. I hope we lived up to our commitment to present the facts — and let the facts speak for themselves,” Thompson said.\n\nHe continued, “Let me say in closing, the women and men seated around me on this dais are public servants in the most genuine sense. They put aside politician and partisanship, to ensure the success of this committee, and providing answers to the American people.”\n\nThompson specifically thanked Republican Rep. Liz Cheney for her participation. “I especially want to thank and acknowledge our vice chair, who has become a true partner in this bipartisan effort, Ms. Cheney of Wyoming.”\n\nAmerica is still in a time of ""reflection and reckoning"" nearly 2 years after Jan. 6, chairman says\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said the panel’s findings show that former President Donald Trump was responsible for the insurrection at the US Capitol and that there is still “reckoning” left to do, nearly two years later.\n\n“We remain in strange and uncharted waters,” Thompson said, as the committee comes to the close.\n\nIn opening statements to the committee’s final public session, Thompson said Americans show faith in elected officials that they will abide by laws and uphold elected results.\n\n“If the faith is broken, so is our democracy,” he said. “Donald Trump broke that faith. He lost the 2020 election and knew it, but he chose to try to stay in office through a multi-part scheme to overturn the results and block the transfer of power.”\n\n“In the end, he summoned a mob to Washington,” he said, adding that their findings show Trump knew they were “armed and angry.”\n\nThompson said the committee intends to make the bulk of its results public in the form of its final report, expected to be released Wednesday.\n\nAlong with adopting its final report on Monday, the committee is also expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, CNN previously reported.\n\n“So, today, beyond our findings, we will also show that evidence we’ve gathered points to further action beyond the power of this committee, or the Congress, to help ensure accountability under law,” he added.\n\n“Accountability that can only be found in the criminal justice system. We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a roadmap to justice,” he said.\n\nThompson didn’t announce the criminal referrals in his opening statement but said that the panel has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nCNN’s Jeremy Herb contributed reporting to this post.\n\nNOW: The Jan. 6 committee has started its final public meeting\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has begun its final public meeting.\n\nThe panel is expected to announce criminal referrals to the Justice Department and Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, has said the panel will approve its final report at the meeting. It won’t be made public until Wednesday. Members of the committee have promised to release the report before the end of the year since Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nThe meeting — which, unlike previous gatherings of the committee, is not a hearing with witnesses — will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals, Thompson said last week.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies.\n\nThe committee has been investigating the events on and leading up to the insurrection since the panel was formed in July 2021.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee’s final public session is starting soon. Here are key things to watch for.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, will soon hold its last public meeting, marking the end of an expansive investigation that has spanned more than 17 months, encompassed more than 1,000 interviews and culminated in accusations that former President Donald Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nThrough blockbuster hearings, interviews with some of the former president’s closest allies and court battles to free up documents, the committee sought to tell the definitive narrative of what happened in the lead up to and on Jan. 6.\n\nOn Monday, members are expected to vote on its final report – spanning hundreds of pages and encapsulating its key findings, which will be released to the public on Wednesday – as well as present criminal referrals it plans to make to the Justice Department. This meeting will be the panel’s last message to the public, and members are seeking to end on a powerful note.\n\nThe charges the panel is considering asking DOJ to pursue include multiple against Trump, such as obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe recommendations match the allegations the House select committee made against Trump and his elections attorney John Eastman in a previous court proceeding seeking Eastman’s emails.\n\nThe final House report could include additional charges proposed for Trump, according to the source. It will provide justification from the committee investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nThe panel is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to Trump, CNN has reported: former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Eastman, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who leads the Jan. 6 subcommittee tasked with presenting recommendations on criminal referrals to the full panel, recently said that “the gravest offense in constitutional terms is the attempt to overthrow a presidential election and bypass the constitutional order. Subsidiary to all of that are a whole host of statutory offenses, which support the gravity and magnitude of that violent assault on America.”\n\nRaskin, along with Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, both of California, and the panel’s vice chair, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, comprised the subcommittee tasked with providing the full panel with referral recommendations that will be adopted on Monday.\n\nTrump\'s team braces for criminal referrals while he lashes out on social media, sources say\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s team huddled together multiple times since they learned the committee would be issuing criminal referrals — attempting to prepare for what they believed going to happen —a criminal referral from the House Select Committee to the Department of Justice.\n\nSources close to Trump said much of his inner circle were not ignoring the committee’s actions, despite many around the former president brushing it off as political.\n\nMany of his top advisers spent time on the phone with legal counsel, trying to get a deeper understanding of what exactly criminal referrals would mean and how to plan a response.\n\nWhile some aides said Trump was unbothered by the committee, the former president spent the weekend fixated on their actions.\n\nIn a flurry of social media posts on Truth Social, Trump called the committee names, accused them of “illegally leaking confidential info” and hitting individuals sitting on the committee.\n\nHe also posted copies of tweets from the afternoon on Jan. 6, calling for protestors to be “peaceful.” During the Jan. 6 hearings, former White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews testified that she was told Trump did not want to include any mention of “peace” in his tweets, but ultimately gave in to White House officials and advisers urged the former president to do more as the violent attack was unfolding.\n\nThe criminal referrals are just the latest in a long line of legal battles Trump is facing as he ramps up his third presidential campaign.\n\nToday\'s committee meeting is expected to have a ""simple and sober"" tone\n\nAs the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection lays out its evidence and criminal referrals today, lawmakers are expected to hit a sober tone, sources say.\n\nToday’s meeting is expected to be relatively brief with some multimedia presentations.\n\nUnlike previous hearings that relied on compelling witness testimony and splashy video montages, today’s event is designed to drive home the key evidence the committee uncovered and the gravity of what transpired in the run up and on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Nobody’s spiking the football here,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat and Jan. 6 committee member, told CNN just ahead of the committee meeting.\n\nJan. 6 committee treating release of executive summary and today\'s meeting as a roadmap for DOJ, sources say\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is treating today’s public meeting and the release of its executive summary as a “roadmap” for the Department of Justice, sources tell CNN.\n\nThe committee intends to lay out its body of evidence and drive home its conclusion that former President Donald Trump was culpable for the events that transpired on Jan. 6, 2021 — the basis for its plans to refer Trump to DOJ on at least three criminal charges.\n\nLawmakers are primarily focused on laying out their case for DOJ, but their wide-ranging investigation has uncovered information that congressional investigators believe could be relevant to various bodies — from state bars to the House ethics committee.\n\nCongressional investigators have already provided what they believe is evidence of criminal activity to an Atlanta-area district attorney leading a criminal investigation into Trump and his allies, according to someone familiar with the investigation.\n\nTrump legal team mired in disagreements as he faces criminal referral\n\nAs the Jan. 6 committee is expected to issue a criminal referral for former President Donald Trump, his legal team has continued to be bogged down in internal disagreements about the many probes facing him.\n\nTrump’s team has met to talk about what to expect from the committee today, but they are much more focused and concerned with the other investigations facing him, including the federal grand jury on Jan. 6, the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation and the special grand jury in Georgia, multiple people familiar with the workings of the team say.\n\nDespite the many probes facing Trump, his team is not acting as a unified front, but has often been locked in serious disagreement over how to proceed on several of the investigations, mainly when it comes to the documents one.\n\nOne thing Trump’s advisers will watch for today is how deep the referrals from the committee go and whether it mentions obstruction of the investigation when it pertains to Trump.\n\nTrump advisers and aides will be watching the meeting today closely, however sources close to Trump said the former President has told them he does not plan on watching.\n\nHowever, he will be updated by people around him, as he has been for all of the public hearings thus far.\n\nAs of now, Trump’s legal team will not be engaging in the response to the committee today, however sources stress that this could change as the public meeting unfolds.\n\nThese are the crimes the Jan. 6 committee is said to be considering for a Trump referral\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is eyeing multiple alleged crimes for a referral of former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, CNN reported last week.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the matter, they include:\n\nInsurrection\n\nObstruction of an official proceeding\n\nConspiracy to defraud the federal government\n\nFor the latter two, the lawmakers can rely on an opinion from a federal judge in California, who wrote earlier this year that there was evidence that Trump and his allies were plotting to defraud the US government and to obstruct an official proceeding. The opinion was handed down by US District Judge David O. Carter in a dispute over whether the House could access certain emails sent to and from former Trump attorney John Eastman.\n\nThe judge cited emails discussing Trump’s awareness that certain voter fraud claims being made in court were inaccurate as evidence of a plot to defraud the federal government. To explain his finding of evidence of obstruction, the judge pointed to emails that showed that the Trump team was contemplating filing lawsuits not to obtain legitimate legal relief, but to meddle in congressional proceedings.\n\nA House referral for an insurrection charge would be a more aggressive move. It’s a crime to assist or engage in “in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws.” Judges have used the term “insurrection” to describe the January 6 attack on Congress’ certification of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut the Justice Department has not opted to bring the charge in its hundreds of US Capitol riot cases. Instead, prosecutors have relied on criminal statutes related to violence, obstruction of an official proceeding, and, in some limited cases, seditious conspiracy.\n\nWho else could be referred? The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies including, Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, multiple sources told CNN earlier this month.\n\nAnother source cautioned at the time that while names were being considered, there was still discussion to be had before they were finalized.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nRep. Schiff: Jan. 6 committee considering how to handle uncooperative GOP lawmakers\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, said Sunday the panel is considering how to hold accountable the GOP lawmakers who defied their subpoenas.\n\nSchiff said the committee would be considering this on Monday, noting that the panel has weighed whether it is better to criminally refer members of Congress to other parts of the federal government or if Congress should “police its own.” Such congressional mechanisms could include censure and referrals to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nFive House Republicans have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 panel: GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe select committee is set to hold its final public hearing today and release its full report on Wednesday. The panel is expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe impact House referrals could have remains unclear because the Department of Justice special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut in addition to criminal referrals, Jan. 6 committee Chairman Bennie Thompson told reporters that the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\n“Censure was something that we have considered. Ethics referrals is something we have considered,” Schiff said Sunday, noting that the committee will disclose its decision Monday.\n\nCNN previously reported that the panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies, including former Trump attorney John Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark and former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to multiple sources.\n\nWhy today\'s Jan. 6 committee session is a meeting and not a hearing\n\nNearly two years removed from the violent attack on the US Capitol, the House select committee tasked with finding out exactly what happened is about to show its hand.\n\nThe panel will hold its final public meeting on Monday, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday.\n\nUnlike previous gatherings of the committee, Monday’s is a business meeting rather than a hearing as no witnesses are set to testify.\n\nWhat to expect from the session: The public meeting, scheduled for 1:00 p.m. ET, is expected to see the panel announce that it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department.\n\nThe committee will release an executive summary of the investigation’s report on Monday after the meeting, a committee aide said Sunday. The final report, to be released two days later, will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nWhy now? Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nA recap of what unfolded in the Jan. 6 committee\'s hearing in October\n\nThe House select committee’s October hearing on the Capitol Hill insurrection used testimony and evidence to demonstrate how former President Donald Trump knew he had lost the election but still went forward with efforts to overturn the results, leading to the attack on the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHere’s a recap of what unfolded at the hearing:\n\nThe committee voted to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony.\n\nPreviously unseen footage aired from the DC-area Army base where congressional leaders took refuge during the insurrection.\n\nElaine Chao, who resigned from her post as Trump’s secretary of Transportation a day after the insurrection, spoke in personal terms about her disgust toward the attack when she testified. “I think the events at the Capitol, however they occurred, were shocking,” she said.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, provided new testimony to the committee relaying anecdotes of Trump acknowledging he had lost the election.\n\nThe panel revealed some of what they had learned from the 1 million Secret Service records obtained within roughly three months since the last January 6 committee hearing.\n\nThe committee revealed new evidence that Trump had devised a plan, well before any votes were counted, to declare victory no matter what the election results were.\n\nCommittee members interviewed Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, last month but ultimately her testimony was not featured as part of the panel’s hearing in October.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHere\'s what the Jan. 6 committee chair said about the referrals the panel will announce Monday\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters last week that the panel will make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department in Monday’s meeting.\n\nWhat this means: Criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack ongoing.\n\nCommittee members see criminal referrals as a critical part of their work, putting their views on the record in order to complete their investigation – not as a way to pressure DOJ, sources have told CNN.\n\nThompson told CNN that the panel is looking at five to six categories of referrals beyond those deemed criminal, but has not decided on the specific number of individuals.\n\nThompson said that in addition to criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, there could be other categories of referrals the committee makes such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nThompson told reporters last Tuesday that Monday’s public meeting will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals.\n\nA subcommittee of members has made recommendations to the full committee about various referrals. During the public meeting, the full committee is expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nCNN reported earlier this month that the committee is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to former President Donald Trump,\n\nA reminder of the key events that unfolded during the Jan. 6 insurrection\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is set to lay out its findings in a final report. When and how the events occurred that day have been a key part of the committee’s probe since the panel formed in July 2021.\n\nSupporters of then-President Trump breached the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, engulfing the building in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to protest against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to certify President Biden’s win.\n\nHere’s how key events unfolded throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump’s speech:\n\nAt 1:10 p.m. ET, while Congress began the process of affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, Trump encouraged his supporters to protest at the US Capitol. Despite promising he would join them, Trump retreated to the White House in his SUV and watched on television as the violence unfolded on Capitol Hill.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. ET, hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers “traitors” for doing their jobs.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Then-Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.\n\nAn armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.\n\nThe Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they had successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they were removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.\n\nThe US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building.\n\nWith about 30 minutes to go before Washington, DC’s 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds. It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.\n\nLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business — namely, confirming Biden’s win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.\n\nProceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence — who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary — bringing the Senate session back into order.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier on the evening of Jan. 6 that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session that night.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the “United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.”\n\nIt took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning (Jan. 7, 2021), but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden’s election win.\n\nSee the full timeline of events here.\n\nWhy the committee is wrapping up its investigation\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters the committee will hold its final public meeting on Monday and that the panel’s full report will come out December 21.\n\nThompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said the committee will approve the panel’s final report on Dec. 19 and make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department, but the public will not see the final report until two days later.\n\n“We will do all of the business of the committee on the 19th,” Thompson said, which includes voting on the final report.\n\nMembers of the committee have promised to have the committee’s report released before the end of the year, as Republicans are expected to dissolve the committee when they take over the chamber in the next Congress.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe other notable investigations Trump faces\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, whose third White House bid has already become mired in controversy, is facing a myriad of legal issues, alongside his business and allies.\n\nAside from the Jan. 6 committee’s probe, here are some other notable investigations involving Trump:\n\nTax returns.The House Ways and Means Committee finally got access to the former president’s tax returns after the Supreme Court dealt a massive defeat to Trump, paving the way for the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the documents to the Democratic-led House. The committee’s chairman, Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sought the tax returns from the IRS in 2019, and the agency, under the Trump administration, initially resisted turning them over.\n\nMar-a-Lago documents. Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed special counsel Jack Smith to oversee the Justice Department criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were brought to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury in Washington has been empaneled and has interviewed potential witnesses to how Trump handled the documents.\n\n2020 Election. The Justice Department has an investigation of its own into the post-2020 election period. While DOJ has not acted publicly during the so-called quiet period leading up to the midterms, a grand jury in Washington has been hearing from witnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is overseeing a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. The probe was launched following Trump’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.\n\nTrump Organization. New York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation, sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\nJames alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.\n\nRead more about other investigations here.\n\nThese are the 9 members on the Jan. 6 committee\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report.\n\nThe committee is made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nChair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California\n\nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California\n\nRepublicans\n\nVice chair: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nHere\'s what a criminal referral is — and what it means for the Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection is set to make announcements at its final public meeting on Monday about criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\nSo what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case.\n\nWith the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nBut whether the department brings charges will depend on whether the facts and the evidence support a prosecution, Attorney General Merrick Garland has said. Garland will make the ultimate call on charging decisions.\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chair of the Jan. 6 committee, has said the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nEx-police officer who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 says he wants to see DOJ indict Trump\n\nMichael Fanone, a former DC police officer and CNN law enforcement analyst, told CNN he would like to see the referrals from the Jan. 6 committee lead to an indictment of former President Donald Trump.\n\nFanone was beaten by rioters during the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.\n\n“I would like to see those individuals put on trial and then again, as I’ve said many times, as Americans we should accept the results of those trials, even if it includes a guilty verdict for former President Donald Trump and jail time,” he said.\n\nFanone also said he is “hopeful” the Justice Department will bring an indictment against Trump.\n\nThe White House is expected to watch quietly as Jan. 6 committee delivers final report this week\n\nWhen the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol delivers its ultimate conclusion to the public this week – holding a final public meeting on Monday and announcing expected criminal referrals to the Justice Department, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday – the White House is expected to watch quietly and decline to offer judgment on any recommendations that the panel may make to the Justice Department.\n\nFor much of the year, top White House officials have made painstaking efforts to avoid delivering specific commentary on the panel’s work. There was one goal in particular of utmost urgency: staying clear of any moves that might suggest that the White House was trying to exert influence on the DOJ.\n\nAnd those efforts are likely to become even more imperative for the Biden White House after the committee refers at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, as a source familiar with the matter said the committee was expected to do this week.\n\nOne White House official told CNN ahead of the committee’s upcoming last meeting on Monday that it would continue to not weigh in on any potential referrals or actions that the panel may take. Another official said this would be in line with the White House’s efforts this year to avoid “running pundit” on the panel’s work.\n\nBut officials also noted that President Biden himself has been clear in his public remarks about the significance of what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, the importance of the committee’s work, not to mention his rejection of last year’s insurrection and the threats to the country’s democratic systems.\n\nIndeed, Biden made that a central theme of his political message in the lead-up to the midterm elections – that decision drew criticism from some fellow Democrats who argued he needed to have a nearly singular focus on the economy, but ultimately left the White House feeling vindicated after Democrats far outperformed expectations.\n\nAnd in the rare moments that Biden did directly comment on the committee, he made clear that he believes the members are doing work critical to documenting history.\n\n“It’s important the American people understand what truly happened and to understand that the same forces that led January 6 remain at work today,” Biden said this summer.\n\nIn October, following a hearing that revealed evidence and testimony from former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchison who said Trump continued efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election even though he knew he had lost reelection, Biden described the testimony and video as “absolutely devastating.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/20/1144303656/5-takeaways-from-the-final-jan-6-committee-hearing', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump referred for criminal charges in final Jan. 6 hearing : NPR', 'Snippet': 'Al Drago/AP. The congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol referred former President Donald Trump for four criminal charges related to an insurrection that ...', 'Full_text': 'The congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol referred former President Donald Trump for four criminal charges related to an insurrection that he inspired because he couldn\'t publicly accept that he\'d lost an election.\n\nIn the face of it all, that former president already announced he is running again to win back the job.\n\nThat\'s the state of American politics, with a divided populace and millions purposely not paying attention to the evidence presented by the committee, just two weeks ahead of the two-year anniversary of the riot.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is out of time. Republicans are set to take control of the House, and the committee is expected to dissolve. So the legal ball will now be in the Justice Department\'s court, while the political one rests with the voters.\n\n""Accountability that can only be found in the criminal justice system,"" committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said. ""We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a roadmap to justice and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we\'ve provided to aid in their work.""\n\nHere are five takeaways of what we learned from the committee\'s last hearing on Monday:\n\n1. Trump — and others — will be referred to the Justice Department for criminal charges.\n\nThe big news out of the final hearing was that after a lengthy investigation, the members of the committee were convinced there was enough evidence to charge Trump on four things:\n\nObstruction of an official proceeding;\n\nConspiracy to defraud the United States;\n\nConspiracy to make a false statement; and\n\nConspiracy to defraud the U.S. by assisting, aiding or comforting those involved in an insurrection\n\nNow, that doesn\'t mean Trump will be charged. The committee has no power over what the Justice Department does. The Justice Department has its own investigation of Trump that\'s been ongoing and currently run by special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith once Trump announced he was running for president again as a way to show independence from the investigation.\n\n""Ours is not a system of justice, where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass,"" said committee member Jamie Raskin, D-Md., announcing the referrals.\n\n2. Members of Congress were referred to the House ethics committee.\n\nThe committee also announced that four members of Congress, who never complied with subpoenas, were referred to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nThey are Republican congressmen:\n\nKevin McCarthy of California;\n\nJim Jordan of Ohio;\n\nScott Perry of Pennsylvania; and\n\nAndy Biggs of Arizona\n\nAll are close allies of Trump, and their resistance in the face of the rules has been emblematic of the antagonistic style of U.S. politics that was growing even before Trump came on the scene.\n\nWhether anything happens to them, though, is unclear since Republicans will control the iteration of the ethics committee in the next Congress and McCarthy is in line to be the next speaker.\n\n3. There\'s lots of evidence Trump knew the truth, but just didn\'t want to be seen as a loser.\n\nAll of what occurred Jan. 6 likely happened simply because Trump didn\'t have an exit ramp, a way to save face after his 2020 election loss.\n\nThat\'s been evident to those of us who\'ve covered Trump for a while, but it was affirmed by Hope Hicks, a former communications adviser in the Trump White House, someone who was very close to Trump.\n\nHicks, whom we heard from for the first time Monday in the course of these hearings, said in taped testimony that she told Trump she was becoming concerned that these false claims of fraud were damaging his legacy.\n\nThis was Trump\'s response:\n\n""He said something along the lines of, \'You know nobody will care about my legacy if I lose,\' "" Hicks said, "" \'So that won\'t matter, the only thing that matters is winning.\' ""\n\nThere is plenty of evidence Trump — and his team — knew he lost, that the allegations of fraud were baseless and that he knew what he was doing, according to testimony from multiple former Trump administration officials.\n\n""He was—he had—usually he had pretty clear eyes,"" said Bill Stepien, the Trump 2020 campaign manager, according to written testimony released in a report by the committee. ""Like, he understood, you know — you know, we told him where we thought the race was, and I think he was pretty realistic with our viewpoint, in agreement with our viewpoint of kind of the forecast and the uphill climb we thought he had.""\n\nStepien added: ""We\'d have to, you know, relay the news that, yeah, that tip that someone told you about those votes or that fraud or, you know, nothing came of it. That would be our job as, you know, the truth telling squad and, you know, not — not a fun job to be, you know, much — it\'s an easier job to be telling the president about, you know, wild allegations. It\'s a harder job to be telling him on the back end that, yeah, that wasn\'t true.""\n\nOne of Trump\'s campaign lawyers, Alex Cannon, in a mid-to-late November phone call with former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, said, per the report, that he found nothing ""sufficient to change the results in any of the key States.""\n\nMeadows responded saying, ""So there is no there, there?""\n\nEven Trump counsel Rudy Giuliani admitted during his deposition to the committee: ""I do not think the machines stole the election.""\n\nA federal judge noted that Trump was told by email ""that the specific numbers of voter fraud were wrong but continued to tout those numbers, both in court and in public."" And he ""signed a verification swearing under oath that the incorporated, inaccurate numbers \'are true and correct\' or \'believed to be true and correct\' to the best of his knowledge and belief.""\n\nThese aren\'t people who are aligned with Democrats or were ""Never Trump"" or ""Trump Haters,"" as the former president likes to say. In fact, the opposite is true in most of the testimony that\'s been aired by the committee.\n\nIt\'s up to rank-and-file Trump voters whether they can bring themselves to acknowledge the realities without lapsing into baseless conspiracies.\n\n4. Whether the findings will matter politically is unclear.\n\nIt\'s no secret that the country is divided politically and partisanship, particularly among Republicans, has become entrenched. So despite the primary evidence — with testimony from Republicans who were aligned with Trump — people have been watching selectively.\n\nThe committee in its report recognized this:\n\n""Although the Committee\'s hearings were viewed live by tens of millions of Americans and widely publicized in nearly every major news source, the Committee also recognizes that other news outlets and commentators have actively discouraged viewers from watching, and that millions of other Americans have not yet seen the actual evidence addressed by this Report.""\n\nSo the committee said it\'s releasing video summaries with each relevant piece of evidence. And it\'s likely why the beginning of the hearing included so many clips of previously seen testimony from past hearings, almost like the recap of a prior season of a series on Netflix.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest those who watched were moved. Before the hearings, just 48% of independents in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll said they thought Trump was to blame a ""great deal"" or ""good amount"" for what happened that day. After several hearings, the July survey found that the percentage blaming Trump spiked to 57%.\n\nRepublicans were only up marginally — and still fewer than 1-in-5 said Trump was responsible for what happened.\n\nEighty percent of Democrats and 55% of independents said they were paying ""a lot"" or ""some"" attention to the hearings. But 56% of Republicans said they were not.\n\nIt\'s not hard to draw a straight line between the numbers of those paying attention and the movement — or lack thereof — in the survey.\n\n5. The ball is in DOJ\'s — and the public\'s — court.\n\nProgressives have been irritated with Garland\'s methodical (read: slow) pace of pursuing charges against Trump. But it\'s going to be up to the special counsel whether to bring charges or what they are.\n\nThey do not have to act on what the Jan. 6 committee recommends, though investigators are paying close attention to the details of its findings. But don\'t expect to hear much about the special counsel\'s progress, as the DOJ tends to stay pretty quiet, if not wholly silent, on the details of ongoing investigations until they present them in court.\n\nPolitically, it\'s going to be up to voters to choose. Trump will likely retain support with his base. As we noted, Republicans have been the least likely to be paying close attention to these hearings. In a multi-candidate primary, Trump remains the front-runner for the GOP nomination.\n\nBut he\'s in legal trouble in multiple states, not just federally, and many of his preferred candidates — and election deniers — lost in swing states. So whether it\'s because of the chaos that often surrounds him, the threat he presents to U.S. democracy and faith in its elections, or simply because his brand is not a winner in competitive states where Republicans likely need to win to take over the White House and Congress, Trump is at his most vulnerable point since winning the presidency six years ago.\n\nAnd the members of this committee — some of whom won\'t be returning to Congress because of the wrath, or potential wrath, of Trump\'s base — certainly hope voters respond.\n\n""The future of our democracy rests in your hands,"" Thompson said. ""It\'s up to the people to decide who is deserving of the public trust.""'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/jan-6-committee-final-report/index.html', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 committee releases first transcripts from interviews - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The House Jan. 6 committee released the first of hundreds of interview transcripts it compiled during its investigation into the insurrection at the US Capitol and former President Donald Trump ...', 'Full_text': 'Roger Stone’s interview with the Jan. 6 select committee lasted 51 minutes and pleaded with Fifth Amendment for every question that was asked, the panel’s transcripts show.\n\nStone did not comment on anything the panel put in front of him, including photographs, public statements, video clips of interviews, and text messages. He also took the Fifth when asked basic questions like his age.\n\nStone did not reveal who paid for his private flight from Florida to Washington, DC, in the days before Jan. 6, or who paid for his hotel room at the Willard InterContinental, which is where Stone and other Trump allies set a “war room” on Jan. 6. He also would not confirm which events he was invited to speak at on Jan. 5 and 6, by whom, or if he even attended them at all.\n\nHe was previously convicted of lying to Congress during its investigation into Russian meddling in 2016. Prosecutors argued that he lied to protect then-President Donald Trump, who pardoned him in 2020, before leaving office.\n\nThrough its questioning, the select committee investigators delved into how the Oath Keepers coordinated to protect Stone when he was in Washington, DC, on Jan. 5 and 6, 2021. A group chat through the encrypted messaging app Signal included Stone and Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes, who has been convicted of seditious conspiracy. Stone wrote, “this group is for all event organizers and VIP speakers who need Oath Keepers PSD or event security on Jan 5/6 so they can talk to me and my top OK team leaders all in one place.” Rhodes later messaged that Kelly Meggs from Florida would be Stone’s protection.\n\nThe select committee asked about text exchanges between Stone and “Stop the Steal” rally organizer Ali Alexander, who also was interviewed by the panel, from Jan. 6 where the pair discuss logistics about the rallies that day.\n\n“As I expected, no speaking spot, no VIP entrance for any of my people” Stone said to Alexander at approximately 10:02 a.m. A few hours later, Alexander wrote to stone, “get your ass to the US Capitol” and added “we have a stage & the presidents order.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s one-time national security adviser, Michael Flynn, asserted his Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination to nearly every question asked by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection during his interview with the panel, the transcript of his testimony released Wednesday confirms.\n\nFlynn answered a series of initial questions about his background and military career, acknowledging for example that he joined a group called “The America Project,” which was founded by former Overstock CEO and known election denier Patrick Byrne.\n\nHe also answered when the committee asked if he knew the reason Trump pardoned him.\n\n“Because I think he saw my whole case as a travesty of justice,” Flynn said.\n\nBut when asked why he failed to produce any documents pursuant to the committee’s subpoena, Flynn invoked the Fifth Amendment, ultimately doing so for every other question during the course of his March deposition.\n\nFlynn’s lawyer noted during the interview that his client was appearing before the committee while a lawsuit to quash the panel’s subpoena was still pending.\n\nAmong the questions Flynn responded to by invoking his Fifth Amendment protections, were about his communications with Trump, White House staff, officials at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, officials at the Department of Justice and attorneys representing the former president about election fraud or other irregularities.\n\nMore background: CNN has previously reported that Flynn played a central role in not only spreading baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud and pushed US officials to investigate claims about foreign manipulation of voting machines.\n\nDuring an Oval Office meeting with Trump in mid-December 2020, Flynn also proposed using the federal government to seize voting machines, sources previously told CNN.\n\nHouse Republicans released a report Wednesday focused on security failures at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, highlighting well-documented breakdowns in intelligence sharing, Capitol security and coordination between various law enforcement agencies that responded that day.\n\nTheir primary recommendation centers around reforming the Capitol Police Board and bolstering congressional oversight of the Capitol police force – two issues that were identified by lawmakers of both parties in the wake of Jan. 6.\n\nBut the GOP report is silent on other efforts to disrupt the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election and selective in its criticism of political leaders and their culpability in the security breakdowns on Jan. 6. The report resurfaces largely unfounded allegations to cast blame on Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while glossing over former President Donald Trump’s own role.\n\nRepublicans cast the report as a rebuttal to the House select committee’s investigation into Jan. 6 as they are set to take control of the chamber and endeavor to take back the narrative. Republican lawmakers have said the security failures are paramount and that the select committee overstepped its mandate in its 17-month probe.\n\nThe Democrat-led select committee had planned to release its final report on Wednesday but has delayed the rollout until Thursday. An executive summary released on Monday lays blame for the insurrection squarely on Trump.\n\nMore on the report: The GOP report comes from the five Republicans who Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy initially appointed to serve on the select committee before deciding members of his party would not participate.\n\nIt includes a timeline of events that occurred on Jan. 6, making no mention of the fact that Trump waited hours before calling on the rioters to leave the US Capitol that day and omitting incendiary remarks he made at the rally preceding the attack.\n\nInstead, the report paints Trump as only encouraging his supporters at the White House Ellipse to march to the US Capitol and demonstrate “peacefully,” noticeably omitting other parts of the speech, including when he encouraged rally goers to “fight light hell.”\n\nSimilarly, the timeline includes a tweet Trump sent after the Capitol had been breached, saying: “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”\n\nMissing from the report is Trump’s tweet in which he eventually told the rioters to leave the Capitol – several hours after the deadly riot began.\n\nThe select committee has revealed witness testimony from several former White House officials saying Trump repeatedly refused to call off the rioters despite being asked to do so by a number of his closest advisers.\n\nThe GOP report also doesn’t address Trump’s claim that he issued a directive prior to Jan. 6 to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to the Capitol that day.\n\nTrump’s former Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, in an interview with the select committee, denied Trump gave him formal orders authorizing the deployment of National Guard troops to the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report expected to be released Wednesday.\n\nThe committee is made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nChair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California\n\nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\n\nRep.

Adam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nThe final report the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack is set to release Wednesday launches a new era for criminal investigators, politicians, and members of the public who have been eager to see the nuts and bolts of its work.\n\nHere’s what to watch for:\n\nDetail on possible obstruction of the investigation\n\nIn the summary of its report released earlier this week, the panel revealed it is aware of “multiple efforts by President Donald Trump to contact Select Committee witnesses,” adding that DOJ is aware “of at least one of those circumstances.”\n\nThe summary released Monday also claimed the panel has a “range of evidence suggesting specific efforts to obstruct the Committee’s investigation.” That includes concerns that attorneys paid by Trump’s political committee or allied groups “have specific incentives to defend President Trump rather than zealously represent their own clients.”\n\nDetails of Trump’s effort to visit the Capitol\n\nThe summary details that the panel was ultimately unable to get former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato to corroborate a bombshell moment during the public hearings, in which Hutchinson recalled Ornato describing Trump’s altercation with the head of his security detail when he was told he would not be taken to the Capitol following his speech on the Ellipse.\n\nThe committee summary said both Hutchinson and a White House employee testified to the panel about the Ornato conversation. But “Ornato professed that he did not recall either communication, and that he had no knowledge at all about the President’s anger.”\n\nThe committee wrote that it “has significant concerns about the credibility of this testimony” and vowed to release his transcript publicly.\n\nFundraising efforts\n\nIn terms of financing after the 2020 presidential election and through the Jan. 6 rallies, the committee says it gathered evidence indicating that Trump “raised roughly one quarter of a billion dollars in fundraising efforts between the election and January 6th.”\n\n“Those solicitations persistently claimed and referred to election fraud that did not exist,” the panel wrote.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, has said the panel has evidence that members of the Trump family and inner circle – including Kimberly Guilfoyle – personally benefited from money that was raised based on the former president’s false election claims, but the panel has never gone as far to say a financial crime has been committed.\n\nRead more on what to watch for here.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee made a startling allegation on Monday, claiming it had evidence that a Trump-backed attorney urged a key witness to mislead the committee about details they recalled. In the executive summary of the final report, the committee revisited the issue in its handoff of the investigation to the Justice Department.\n\nAccording to the report, “the lawyer had advised the witness that the witness could, in certain circumstances, tell the Committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them.” The committee declined to identify the people.\n\nWhat we know: However, CNN has learned that Stefan Passantino, the top ethics attorney in the Trump White House, is the lawyer who allegedly advised his then-client, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, to tell the committee that she did not recall details that she did, sources familiar with the committee’s work tell CNN. Before her public testimony, Hutchinson dropped Passantino and got a new lawyer.\n\nTrump’s Save America political action committee funded Passantino and his law firm Elections LLC, including paying for his representation of Hutchinson, other sources tell CNN. The committee report notes the lawyer did not tell his client who was paying for the legal services.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Passantino said he didn’t advise Hutchinson to mislead the committee. “I represented Ms. Hutchinson honorably, ethically, and fully consistent with her sole interests as she communicated them to me. I believed Ms. Hutchinson was being truthful and cooperative with the Committee throughout the several interview sessions in which I represented her.”\n\nPassantino pointed out it’s not uncommon for people to change lawyers “because their interests or strategies change,” according to his statement. He also said political committees sometimes cover client fees “at the client’s request.”\n\nBy Tuesday, Passantino’s professional biography had been removed from the website of a midwestern-based law firm where he was a partner – and he acknowledged in his statement he was on a leave of absence from the firm “given the distraction of this matter.” He remains a partner at Elections LLC.\n\nLawyers must follow extensive ethics guidelines as part of their profession, including avoiding conflicts of interest that could compromise their representation of a client. According to legal ethics experts, a lawyer swaying their client’s testimony in a way that wouldn’t be entirely truthful could be looked at as possible obstruction of an investigation.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has started handing over evidence — documents and transcripts — to the Justice Department in the last week, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith had sent a letter to the committee on Dec. 5, requesting all of the information from the panel’s investigation, another source told CNN.\n\nThe information transfer focuses specifically on former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s former election lawyer John Eastman, the source added. The DOJ also received Meadows text messages from the committee.\n\nThe panel also has started to share transcripts of witness interviews pertaining to the false slates of electors and the pressure campaign by the former president and his allies on certain states to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\n“We’ve actually given some transcripts to the Department of Justice during the last month,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the select committee, told CNN Monday.\n\nThe committee also is slated to release its full final report today.\n\nSpokespersons for the committee and for the special counsel did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nThe final report from the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, will include information about Republican National Committee fundraising directly after the 2020 presidential election, what Secret Service knew ahead of the attack and the response by the National Guard, committee member Rep. Pete Aguilar said earlier this month.\n\nThe comments from Aguilar expand on themes the committee has presented in its previous hearings and detail to a new level what is expected to appear in the final report. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, has previously told CNN the panel’s final report will contain eight chapters.\n\nSome information in the report will be redacted due to security concerns, according to Aguilar.\n\nHe added that “there have been some conversations with people who came before us, where we indicated we would redact some small pieces,” such as current workplaces, that are important to protect.\n\nWith its mic drop finale, the House committee investigating the US Capitol insurrection left a fateful question hanging over Washington, Donald Trump and the 2024 presidential campaign: will the ex-president be charged with a crime?\n\nThe committee announced in its final public meeting on Monday it was recommending to the Justice Department that Trump be prosecuted on at least four charges, carefully matching the panel’s catalog of violence, lies, insurrection and dereliction of duty up to and on January 6, 2021, with specific legal statutes.\n\nYet the panel, despite delivering what it called a “roadmap to justice,” has no power to try Trump and its decisions are not binding on the Justice Department.\n\nThe DOJ has its own investigation and faces prosecutorial decisions that require a higher bar than the committee’s political gambits. The potential charges concerned also have little case law precedent.\n\nAnd while both Attorney General Merrick Garland and the House committee have long argued that every American should be subject to equal justice, the gravity of indicting an ex-president and current White House candidate who has already used violence as a political tool means the department’s dilemma is among the most fateful in American history.\n\nMore broadly, the committee has now sketched the most urgent framing of a perennial question about Trump’s riotous careers in business and politics: Will he ever face accountability for his rule-breaking conduct?\n\nThe question is especially acute given that the norm crushed this time almost toppled US democracy.\n\nRead the full analysis here.\n\nFor months, the Jan. 6 committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. On Monday, the committee didn’t equivocate.\n\nThe committee referred Trump to the DOJ on at least four criminal charges, including:\n\nObstructing an official proceeding\n\nDefrauding the United States\n\nMaking false statements\n\nAssisting or aiding an insurrection\n\nThe panel said in its executive summary that it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nSo what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nIn practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nBut the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department’s court.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said during Monday’s meeting that he has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nAfter the panel’s meeting, Thompson told CNN that the evidence that supports the panel’s decision to refer Trump to the DOJ is “clear,” adding that he is “convinced” that the department will ultimately charge Trump.\n\nCNN’s Tierney Sneed contributed reporting to this post.\n\nOn Monday, the January 6 committee released an executive summary of its report, and it plans to release the full report on Wednesday, as well as transcripts of committee interviews.\n\nHere are takeaways from the committee’s final public meeting:\n\nCommittee refers Trump to DOJ. The committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nAll roads lead to Trump. Committee members repeatedly pointed to Trump’s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on January 6. Monday’s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break “the foundation of American democracy.”\n\nCommittee uses video to illustrate case. The committee showed a video montage laying out all of its allegations against Trump, from witnesses saying that Trump was told he lost the election by his aides to the former president’s failure to act on January 6 as the violence at the Capitol was unfolding. The montage went step-by-step through Trump’s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters.\n\nA bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois described how his House GOP colleagues were complicit in Trump’s efforts to overturn the election. He highlighted evidence that Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to “put the facade of legitimacy” on his voter fraud claims so “Republican congressmen … can distort and destroy and create doubt” about the 2020 election results.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has concluded that former President Donald Trump was ultimately responsible for the insurrection, laying out for the public and the Justice Department a trove of evidence for why he should be prosecuted for multiple crimes.\n\nThe summary describes in extensive detail how Trump tried to overpower, pressure and cajole anyone who wasn’t willing to help him overturn his election defeat — while knowing that many of his schemes were unlawful. His relentless arm-twisting included election administrators in key states, senior Justice Department leaders, state lawmakers, and others. The report even suggests possible witness tampering with the committee’s investigation.\n\nThe full report, based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation by the nine-member bipartisan committee, will be released Wednesday, along with along with transcripts and other materials collected in the investigation.\n\nHere are some key things from the report summary:\n\nCommittee referring Trump and others to DOJ: The House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Trump attorney John Eastman and “others.” The report summary says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nTrump’s false victory was “premeditated”: The committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\nTrump’s belief that the election is stolen is no excuse, lawmakers say: Sources familiar with Trump’s legal strategy in the Justice Department probe have told CNN that his attorneys believe prosecutors face an uphill battle in proving he did not believe the election was stolen despite being told as much by senior members of his own administration.\n\nIn making its case for a Justice Department prosecution of Trump, the House committee took aim at that possible defense.\n\nSeveral members of Congress being referred to House Ethics Committee: The select committee is referring several Republican lawmakers who refused to cooperate with the investigation to the House Ethics Committee. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona, could all face possible sanctions for their refusal to comply with committee subpoenas.\n\nTrump and others may try this again, committee warns: The summary’s section outlining the referrals makes a case for why the Justice Department’s prosecutions should extend beyond the rioters who physically breached the Capitol.\n\nThe committee says that Trump “believed then, and continues to believe now, that he is above the law, not bound by our Constitution and its explicit checks on Presidential authority.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/jan-6-final-report-capitol-1.6696232', 'Headline': ""Jan. 6 committee's final report finds Trump was 'central cause' of ..."", 'Snippet': 'The House Jan. 6 committee\'s final report asserts that Donald Trump criminally engaged in a ""multi-part conspiracy"" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election and failed to ...', 'Full_text': 'The House Jan. 6 committee\'s final report asserts that Donald Trump criminally engaged in a ""multi-part conspiracy"" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the U.S. Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection almost two years ago.\n\nThe 845-page report released Thursday comes after the panel interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, held 10 hearings and obtained millions of pages of documents.\n\nThe witnesses — ranging from many of Trump\'s closest aides to law enforcement to some of the rioters themselves — detailed Trump\'s actions in the weeks ahead of the insurrection and how his wide-ranging pressure campaign to overturn his defeat directly influenced those who brutally pushed past the police and smashed through the windows and doors of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n""The central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump,"" reads the report. ""None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him.""\n\nThe insurrection gravely threatened democracy and ""put the lives of American lawmakers at risk,"" the nine-member panel concluded.\n\nTrump facing multiple investigations\n\nIn a foreword to the report, outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the findings should be a ""clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defence of our constitution.""\n\nThe report\'s eight chapters of findings tell the story largely as the panel\'s hearings did this summer — describing the many facets of the remarkable plan that Trump and his advisers devised to try to void U.S. President Joe Biden\'s victory. The lawmakers describe his pressure on states, federal officials, lawmakers and former vice-president Mike Pence to game the system or break the law.\n\nIn the two months between the election and the insurrection, the report says, ""President Trump or his inner circle engaged in at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation, targeting either State legislators or State or local election administrators, to overturn State election results.""\n\nTrump\'s repeated, false claims of widespread voter fraud resonated with his supporters, the committee said, and were amplified on social media, building on the distrust of government he had fostered for his four years in office. And he did little to stop them when they resorted to violence and stormed the Capitol.\n\nThe massive, damning report comes as Trump is running again for the presidency and also facing multiple federal investigations, including probes of his role in the insurrection and the presence of classified documents at his Florida estate.\n\nThis week is particularly fraught for him, as a House committee is expected to release his tax returns after he has fought for years to keep them private. And Trump has been blamed by Republicans for a worse-than-expected showing in November\'s midterm elections, leaving him in his most politically vulnerable state since he won the 2016 election.\n\nPosting on his social media site, Trump called the report ""highly partisan"" and falsely claimed it didn\'t include his statement on Jan. 6 that his supporters should protest ""peacefully and patriotically."" The committee noted he followed that comment with election falsehoods and charged language exhorting the crowd to ""fight like hell.""\n\nThe report details a multitude of failings by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But it makes an emphatic point that security failures are not what led to the insurrection.\n\n187 minutes\n\n""The President of the United States inciting a mob to march on the Capitol and impede the work of Congress is not a scenario our intelligence and law enforcement communities envisioned for this country,"" the committee\'s chairman, Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, writes in a separate foreword.\n\nThe report details Trump\'s inaction as his loyalists were violently storming the building. Returning to the White House from his fiery speech, he asked an employee if they had seen his remarks on television.\n\n""Sir, they cut it off because they\'re rioting down at the Capitol,"" the staffer said, according to the report.\n\nRead the final report from the committee:\n\nA White House photographer snapped a picture of Trump at 1:21 p.m., learning of the riot from the employee. ""By that time, if not sooner, he had been made aware of the violent riot at the Capitol,"" the report states.\n\nIn total, 187 minutes elapsed between the time Trump finished his speech at the Ellipse and his first effort to get the rioters to disperse, through an eventual video message in which he asked his supporters to go home even as he reassured them, ""We love you, you\'re very special.""\n\nDuring those hours, dozens of staffers and associates pleaded with him to make a forceful statement. But he did not.\n\nThe committee quotes some of Trump\'s most loyal supporters blaming him for the violence.\n\n""We all look like domestic terrorists now,"" longtime aide Hope Hicks texted Julie Radford, who served as Ivanka Trump\'s chief of staff, in the aftermath.\n\nHicks also texted a White House lawyer: ""I\'m so upset. Everything we worked for wiped away.""\n\nThe investigation\'s release is a final act for House Democrats, who are ceding power to Republicans in less than two weeks, and have spent much of their four years in power investigating Trump. Democrats impeached Trump twice, the second time a week after the insurrection. He was acquitted by the Senate both times. Other Democratic-led probes investigated his finances, his businesses, his foreign ties and his family.\n\nOn Monday, the panel of seven Democrats and two Republicans officially passed their investigation to the Justice Department, recommending the department investigate the former president on four crimes, including aiding an insurrection. While the criminal referrals have no legal standing, they are a final statement from the committee after its extensive, year-and-a-half-long probe.\n\nTrump has tried to discredit the report, slamming members of the committee as ""thugs and scoundrels"" as he has continued to falsely dispute his 2020 loss.\n\nIn response to the panel\'s criminal referrals, Trump said: ""These folks don\'t get it that when they come after me, people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me.""\n\nInterview transcripts released\n\nThe committee has also begun to release hundreds of transcripts of its interviews. On Thursday, the panel released transcripts of two closed-door interviews with former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who testified in person at one of the televised hearings over the summer and described in vivid detail Trump\'s efforts to influence the election results and indifference toward the violence as it occurred.\n\nIn the two interviews, both conducted after her July appearance at the hearing, she described how many of Trump\'s allies, including her lawyer, pressured her not to say too much in her committee interviews.'}}",92.91666666666667,3

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-release-counter-report-jan-6-security-failures-capitol', 'Headline': 'House Republicans release counter report on Jan. 6 security failures at ...', 'Snippet': 'The Democrat-led Jan. 6 select committee is expected release its final report on the Capitol riot Thursday.

It said changes to USCP intelligence protocols in the lead-up to Jan. 6 ""caused confusion and rendered a key USCP component ineffective"" during the mob violence.\n\nRepublicans accused former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving of being ""compromised by politics,"" coordinating closely with Pelosi and her staff but leaving GOP lawmakers out of discussions about security. The report said Democratic leaders were concerned over the ""optics"" of deploying the National Guard in response to the riot, given the Black Lives Matter riots that took place in the summer of 2020. The GOP lawmakers alleged these concerns prevented early deployment of the National Guard.\n\n""To make matters worse, systemic issues have crippled the security apparatus for years. USCP line officers were under-trained and ill-equipped to protect the Capitol complex,"" the report said. ""One officer testified to investigators that he went into the fight on January 6, 2021 with nothing but his USCP-issued baseball cap. Even if every USCP officer had been at work that day, their numbers would still have been insufficient to hold off the rioters due to a lack of training and equipment. The USCP was set up to fail, and there have been scant signs of progress toward addressing these weaknesses.""\n\nRepublicans said the evidence gathered in their report came from witnesses and USCP sources whose identities are protected for fear of retaliation. Additionally, the House investigators interviewed USCP Chief Tom Manger, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker, and the Assistant Director of the Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division Julie Farnam. The investigation also relied on public documents and news reports to supplement their findings.\n\nDEMOCRATS RELEASE REPORT ON TRUMP TAX RETURNS, REVEALING INCOME, TAXES PAID, IRS AUDIT\n\nThe GOP report is meant to supplement a bipartisan report released by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and the Committee on Rules and Administration last year. That report identified several security, planning and response failures leading up to the riot, including FBI and Homeland Security intelligence officials neglecting to warn of potential violence and USPC unpreparedness.\n\n""The intelligence failures, coupled with the Capitol Police Board’s failure to request National Guard assistance prior to January 6th, meant the District of Columbia National Guard (DCNG) was not activated, staged, and prepared to quickly respond to an attack on the Capitol,"" the Senate report found.\n\nPelosi has repeatedly denied GOP allegations that she or her office prevented the National Guard from deploying, or otherwise ignored threats of violence leading up to the riot.\n\nThe Democrat-led Jan. 6 select committee is expected release its final report on the Capitol riot Thursday. Seven Democrats and the two anti-Trump Republicans on the committee, Reps. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., have for months alleged that the ""insurrection"" mounted by former President Trump\'s supporters was the final step in his plan to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nNAACP PRESIDENT TWEETS ALL HE WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS IS ‘DONALD TRUMP IN HANDCUFFS’\n\nThe committee released a 154-page executive summary of their findings on Monday and referred criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department.\n\n""What Donald Trump proceeded to do after the 2020 election is something no president had done before in our country,"" said Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. ""In a staggering betrayal of his oath, Donald Trump attempted a plan that led to an attack on a pillar of our democracy.""\n\nThe panel argued during the committee\'s final meeting that Trump\'s conduct before and after Jan. 6 was ""unlawful."" Lawmakers say they have sufficient evidence that Trump obstructed an official proceeding of Congress, conspired to defraud the federal government, made a false statement, and incited, assisted or aided an insurrection.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOver its 18-month tenure, the committee obtained access to tens of thousands of documents and conducted nearly 1,000 interviews related to the Capitol protests.\n\nRead the GOP report:'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/10/13/pelosi-congressional-leaders-capitol-january-6-hearing-vpx.cnn', 'Headline': '‘Do you believe this?’: New video shows Pelosi’s reaction to Capitol ...', 'Snippet': 'The House January 6 select committee revealed never-before-seen footage of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders reacting to the Capitol attack from a secure location.', 'Full_text': ""Video player was slow to load content Video content never loaded Ad froze or did not finish loading Video content did not start after ad Audio on ad was too loud Other issues\n\nAd never loaded Ad prevented/slowed the page from loading Content moved around while ad loaded Ad was repetitive to ads I've seen previously Other issues""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/10/nancy-pelosi-january-6-video-trump-capitol-riot.html', 'Headline': 'What the Nancy Pelosi Jan. 6 Footage Revealed - Slate Magazine', 'Snippet': 'Alex Wong/Getty Images.

All the while Donald Trump sat mesmerized by the television in the White House dining room. As committee member Jamie Raskin spelled out, referring to Pelosi and her colleagues, “All of them did what President Trump was not doing, what he simply refused to do.” (That the tape came from the speaker’s daughter has sparked a familiar conspiracy theory, if you’re so inclined.)\n\nThe footage serves as a reminder that much of the real work of a legislative leader like Pelosi is conducted off screen and on the phone: berating, cajoling, huddling with colleagues, as well as bargaining with opponents. A president needs to look like a forceful leader for the camera, but a speaker of the house must be the real thing behind the scenes. While Pelosi has a reputation for being a somewhat stiff public speaker and a middling communicator with the press—and, particularly among the leftward wing of the party, for peddling outdated politics—what’s much more central to her job is formulating priorities (“We have got to finish the proceedings, or else they will have a complete victory”) and wrangling other public officials to pitch in (“Imagine this was the Pentagon or the White House under siege”). Even if you believe that Pelosi is very, very good at all this, we just don’t often get to see her do it very often.\n\nThe committee intercut scenes of Pelosi and Chuck Schumer coping with the crisis with shots of rioters baying for Pelosi to be brought out and delivered to the mob along with Mike Pence. Who knows what they would have done if they’d actually got their hands on either one. Pelosi, like the rest of us, surely didn’t see that chilling footage until later, but she knew the rioters were rampaging through the Capitol, ransacking offices and smearing feces. She was aware that even after most of them were ejected, a tenacious straggler could still be hiding on the premises, capable of violence, and favoring her as his target. She certainly knows how much such people really, really hate her, and that may be the most sincere testimonial to her competence.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/video-nancy-pelosi-january-6-trump-pelosis-power-documentary/', 'Headline': 'How Nancy Pelosi Responded as Jan. 6 and Its Aftermath Unfolded - PBS', 'Snippet': 'On Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election, Nancy Pelosi was among their targets. In scenes ...', 'Full_text': 'On Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election, Nancy Pelosi was among their targets.\n\nIn scenes from Pelosi’s Power, the first documentary on the life and legacy of the first woman speaker of the House, rioters chant Pelosi’s name as they move through the Capitol building. Footage captures them shouting, “Where are you, Nancy? We’re looking for you,” and “Yeah, we’re coming, bitch,” before entering her office.\n\nSusan Page, author of the Pelosi biography Madam Speaker, later asked Pelosi if she’d been afraid.\n\n“Nancy said that they would’ve had a fight on their hands. They would’ve had a battle on their hands, because she’s a street fighter,” Page tells FRONTLINE in the opening moments of Pelosi’s Power, embedded above. “And then she lifts up her foot. And, you know, she always wears those 4-inch stiletto heels. And she points at her shoe and says, ‘Besides, I could’ve used these as weapons.’”\n\nIn the hours and days to come, Pelosi would fight — not against the rioters but against the leader who had fueled the insurrection through false claims about a stolen election.\n\n“She really saw [then-President Donald Trump] as so reckless and dangerous,” says Molly Ball, author of Pelosi and a reporter on the new FRONTLINE documentary. “It was such a white-knuckle moment that, whatever the rules said, you just had to hold down the fort and make sure that things didn’t get further out of hand.”\n\nOn Jan. 7, as the above excerpt recounts, Pelosi called the Pentagon’s top general, Mark Milley, and asked about safeguards to prevent “an unstable president” from initiating any rash actions. Then Pelosi went to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and with him called Vice President Mike Pence, another target of the mob, to ask Pence to invoke the 25th amendment. When Pence didn’t take the call, Pelosi moved toward impeachment.\n\n“There was a total void of leadership in our country at that moment,” Judy Lemons, Pelosi’s chief of staff from 1987 to 2002, says in the above excerpt. “Nancy Pelosi was the one leading the country in that moment. She had to be the one dealing with this crisis. And that’s what she did.”\n\n“She found herself in a singular position of power, with a singular responsibility, at this crucial and dangerous moment, and that was not an accident,” Washington Post columnist Matt Bai says at the end of the clip. “That was a long time coming.”\n\nPelosi’s Power, premiering Tuesday, March 22 at 9/8c on PBS, is the first documentary to explore Pelosi’s journey from her 1987 election as a freshman representative (D-Calif.) to the highest-ranking member of the U.S. House of Representatives. The 90-minute film draws on dozens of in-depth interviews: with Pelosi herself; with her family; with her staffers, Congressional colleagues and fierce opponents; with White House insiders; and with journalists and biographers who have chronicled the career of the woman who is now second in line to the presidency.\n\nWhat emerges is a vivid portrait of one of America’s most powerful and polarizing political figures.\n\n“She’s a no-holds-barred politician that was about partisan warfare 100% of the time,” former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) says in the film.\n\nSays Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post, “Nancy Pelosi has never been accused of bringing a knife to a gunfight.”\n\nThe documentary traces Pelosi’s approach to wielding power back to her childhood in Baltimore, where her father was mayor and a U.S. representative. It explores how Pelosi navigated what Lemons calls “entrenched paternalism and crude sexism” after being elected to Congress in 1987 as one of only 23 women in the 435-person chamber. And it investigates her ascent to the speakership as she fought for policies in support of her self-described lifelong ambition: creating a better future for “the children.”\n\n“Nancy Pelosi came up in a historical era where you increasingly did see politics as combat,” Ball says in the documentary. “So she always said, ‘Every morning, I put on a suit of armor, eat nails for breakfast, and go out and do battle.’”\n\nIncluding, as the documentary shows, with Donald Trump.\n\nAs the U.S. continues to navigate fallout from Jan. 6, and as questions swirl about whether Democrats and Pelosi will maintain control of the House in the 2022 midterms, Pelosi’s Power offers an illuminating window into the speaker: who she is, what drives her and why she believes democracy itself is at stake.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-63250182', 'Headline': 'US Capitol riots: Footage shows Nancy Pelosi seeking help - BBC', 'Snippet': 'In previously unseen footage, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is seen calling for more help to be sent to the US Capitol as riots break outside.

Startled, Pelosi asked the woman to repeat what she said.\n\n“Do you believe this?” Pelosi said in disbelief to another Democratic leader, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.\n\nIt was around 2:45 p.m. and the violent cacophony had already disrupted the planned certification of the 2020 presidential election results. It would be hours before the building was secure.\n\nAt one point, Pelosi said of President Donald Trump, “I\'m gonna punch him out.”\n\nNever-before-seen video footage played Thursday by the House Jan. 6 committee, and later on CNN, showed Pelosi and other leaders, including Republican allies of Trump, responding anxiously — and angrily — to the insurrection.\n\nThe recordings offer a rare glimpse into the real-time reactions of the most powerful members of Congress as they scrambled to drum up support from all parts of the government, including from agencies seemingly ill prepared for the chaos, and vented anger over a president whose conduct they felt had endangered their lives.\n\nIn the videos, Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer negotiate with governors and defense officials to try to get the National Guard to the Capitol as police were being brutally beaten outside the building.\n\nThe deployment of the Guard was delayed for hours as Trump stood by and did little to stop the violence of his supporters.\n\nThe footage, recorded by Pelosi\'s daughter, Alexandra, a documentary filmmaker, was shown during the committee\'s 10th hearing as an illustration of the president\'s inaction in the face of grave danger posed by the rioters to the lawmakers forced into hiding inside.\n\n“As the president watched the bloody attack unfold on Fox News from his dining room, members of Congress and other government officials stepped into the gigantic leadership void created by the president\'s chilling and steady passivity that day,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a committee member.\n\nThe concerns were not theoretical. Around 3 p.m., as a Trump loyalist outside Pelosi\'s office pointed her finger and shouted, “We\'re coming in if you don\'t bring her out,"" the speaker was huddled somewhere else in a room with Schumer, who said, “I\'m gonna call up the effin\' secretary of DoD.”\n\nAnd so he did, telling acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller on speakerphone that there were senators still in hideaway spaces and imploring him to send in the Maryland National Guard. Pelosi chimed in that she was going to call the mayor of Washington, D.C., for help as well.\n\nAs the violence persisted outside — “Officer down, get him up,” a voice could be heard bellowing in one clip shown by the committee — the leaders kept making calls inside. One went to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam about the possibility of help from the Virginia National Guard, with Pelosi narrating the events based on what she saw from television news footage.\n\nAn angrier call followed with Jeffrey Rosen, the then-acting attorney general. Days earlier, and unbeknownst at the time to Congress or to the public, Rosen and colleagues had fended off a slapdash attempt by Trump to replace him with a subordinate eager to challenge the election results.\n\nOn that day, though, Schumer and Pelosi sat shoulder-to-shoulder on the couch and laid bare their frustrations with the country\'s top law enforcement official.\n\n“They\'re breaking the law in many different ways,” Pelosi said. “And quite frankly, much of it at the instigation of the president of the United States.”\n\nSchumer weighed in too, shaking his head to the side for emphasis: “Yeah, why don\'t you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility? A public statement they should all leave.”\n\nIn a clip that aired later on CNN, Pelosi was told that the Secret Service had dissuaded Trump from going to the Capitol.\n\n“If he comes, I’m gonna punch him out,” Pelosi responded. “I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m gonna punch him out. And I’m gonna go to jail, and I’m gonna be happy.”\n\nIt wasn\'t until the evening that the Capitol would be cleared and work would resume. The news that Congress would be able to reconvene to finish its work in certifying the election results was delivered to the congressional leaders not by Trump but by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nAfter a very bad day, Schumer had two words: “Good news.”\n\n____\n\nFollow Eric Tucker at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/us/politics/jan-6-video-pelosi-schumer-capitol.html', 'Headline': 'New Jan. 6 Video Shows Pelosi and Schumer Scrambling to Secure the ...', 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — Huddling with congressional leaders in a secure location as the Capitol was under siege on Jan. 6, 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was emphatic: There had to be a way to show the public ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Huddling with congressional leaders in a secure location as the Capitol was under siege on Jan. 6, 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was emphatic: There had to be a way to show the public that the government could function and the transfer of power could continue.\n\nShe asked: Was there a way to return to the Capitol and continue the ceremonial counting of electoral votes to certify the election that had been disrupted as a mob of President Donald J.

I can do the things I’ve done and any executive action I can take, I’ll continue to take. But I can’t outlaw a weapon. I can’t, you know, change the background checks. I can’t do that.”\n\nBiden’s statements about 9mm pistols are in keeping with his rhetoric before entering the White House. At a 2019 fundraiser in Seattle, for example, then-candidate Biden asked his audience: “Why should we allow people to have military-style weapons including pistols with 9mm bullets and can hold 10 or more rounds?”\n\nAccording to Shooting Industry magazine, 9mm pistols accounted for 56.8% of all handguns made in the US during 2019. In all, more than 15.1 million 9mm guns were produced in this country during the 2010s. The possibility of outlawing or otherwise regulating such weapons is likely to be a non-starter among conservatives and gun rights advocates.\n\n“Remember, the Constitution, the Second Amendment, was never absolute,” Biden said. “You couldn’t buy a cannon when the Second Amendment was passed. You couldn’t go out and purchase a lot of weapons.”\n\nBiden has made that claim before, most recently when he announced new regulations to stop the spread of so-called “ghost guns,” and they have been repeatedly declared false by fact-checkers.\n\n“The Second Amendment did not place limits on individual ownership of cannons,” PolitiFact stated in April when it rated his claim false.\n\nThe website pointed out the text of the Constitution: “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”\u200b\n\nDespite widespread public outrage over Tuesday’s massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and the racially motivated May 14 mass shooting at a Buffalo grocery store, Biden said he had not yet spoken with any Republicans about potential gun control legislation, but expressed hope for a compromise.\n\n“I think things have gotten so bad that everybody is getting more rational about it,” he said. “At least, that’s my hope and prayer.”\n\nAsked whether Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) authorizing Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) to work with Democrats could lead to results, Biden said, “I don’t know.”\n\n“I think Senator McConnell is a rational Republican. I think Cornyn is as well,” he added. “I think there’s a recognition in their part that they — we can’t continue like this. We can’t do this.”\n\nWithout Republican support, Democrats are powerless to pass any gun legislation in the 50-50 Senate unless they manage to temporarily set aside the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold for passing most bills.\n\nBiden’s comments came less than 48 hours after Vice President Kamala Harris called for an assault weapons ban after attending a funeral for Buffalo shooting victim Ruth Whitfield, 86.\n\n“You know what an assault weapon is? You know how an assault weapon was designed?” Harris said Saturday. “It was designed for a specific purpose — to kill a lot of human beings quickly. An assault weapon is a weapon of war with no place, no place in a civil society.”'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/14-house-republicans-bipartisan-senate-gun-bill-restrictions-2022-6', 'Headline': 'Here Are the 14 House Republicans Who Voted for New Gun Restrictions ...', 'Snippet': '14 Republicans joined every Democrat in supporting new gun restrictions in the wake of several mass shootings.

Under the proposed rule, Biden’s ATF would go well beyond statutory authority to fabricate presumptions of when an individual needs be an FFL, and the rule itself acknowledges its unlawfulness.\n\nBiden's ATF is using the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (“BSCA”) that was signed into law in 2022 as the impetus for the proposed rule. For background, the BSCA amended the definition of “Engaged in the Business” to read:\n\n“a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business to predominantly earn a profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms,” (18 U.S.C 921(a)21)\n\nand further defined “to predominantly earn a profit” to mean:\n\n“that the intent underlying the sale or disposition of firearms is predominantly one of obtaining pecuniary gain, as opposed to other intents, such as improving or liquidating a personal firearms collection.” (18 U.S.C. 921(a)(22).\n\nATF’s recently proposed rule now aims to create several presumptions when a person is “engaged in the business,” despite the abovementioned definition that contains no such presumptions.\n\nThe law is clear that a person “who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms” is not “engaged in the business.” Despite these clear allowances, the proposed rule contains a presumption regarding renting a table at a gun show, collector show, or other swap meet. This conduct is clearly protected under federal statute if the person is only making “occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases” or if the person is using the table to sell all or part of a collection of firearms.\n\nThe presumptions go even further, and some would deter what many would consider responsible behavior when selling a firearm. There are presumptions of being “engaged in the business” where a person includes the factory packaging with “like new” firearms or where a person keeps detailed records regarding their firearm sales.\n\nOf course, “factory packaging” could include the instruction manual, the included factory lock, and the case (which is likely suitable for safely transporting or storing the firearm). All of these items could be helpful to a new buyer (especially if the buyer is a first time gun owner), but the proposed rule would effectively punish including these items with a firearm.\n\nAnd, treating detailed records regarding sales as evidence of a person being “engaged in business” just incentivizes sellers to keep no records at all. Apparently, the government is fine with making firearm tracing all that more difficult.\n\nRemarkably, the government doesn’t even believe these made-up presumptions are lawful. The proposed rule itself notes that “[t]he rebuttable presumptions [] shall not apply to any criminal case, although they may be useful to courts in criminal cases, for example, when instructing juries regarding permissible inferences.” One might wonder why a new proposed definition of a term that is used in federal criminal statutes cannot be used in criminal cases. The answer is likely that the government knows their own position is unlawful and they do not believe the regulation has any chance of surviving the application of the rule of lenity in a criminal case, where the accused is given the benefit of the doubt when a statutory term is ambiguous.\n\nBeyond the tacit admission of the unlawfulness of the rule, the government does get one thing right. They correctly admit that the statute does not give them the authority to set a limit on the number of firearm transactions that a person can engage in before needing to be licensed. However, in true government form, after making this admission, the rule goes on to describe how even a single transaction could trigger the need to be licensed. So much for the statutory requirement that a person engage in “repetitive purchase and resale” before needing a license.\n\nThe Biden Administration claims that these changes can help move federal law towards so-called “universal background checks,” but that is potentially a trap for law-abiding gun owners. Transferring a firearm through a licensed dealer to run a background check does nothing to help a seller if they meet the government’s new expanded definition of “engaged in the business.” In fact, doing so could provide more evidence to the ATF to use against a seller that they claim is dealing in firearms without an FFL.\n\nMoreover, it’s important to note that this proposed rule and push to require more people become licensed dealers is occurring under the backdrop of the Biden Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, where the ATF is shutting down licensed dealers at an unprecedented pace. The irony that Biden wants to require as many individuals as possible become licensed dealers, while at the same time making it as difficult as possible be an FFL.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nraila.org/articles/20230315/bidens-executive-order-targeting-gun-ownership', 'Headline': 'Biden’s Executive Order Targeting Gun Ownership - NRA-ILA', 'Snippet': 'The good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done.', 'Full_text': 'On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nMedia and gun control groups that beforehand had been salivating over the idea that the measure would impose “universal background checks” for firearm transfers had to content themselves with a vague directive for Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop a “plan” to move in that direction.\n\nAnd while the order’s other provisions were similarly vague and insubstantial, there is no doubt what it all adds up to: antagonism toward gun ownership is now the official policy of the U.S. government’s Executive Branch.\n\nThe good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done. Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them.

A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts.

It has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points. There were 445 Republicans interviewed, 389 independents and 183 Democrats. (Five people declined to answer.)\n\nSupport for some gun-control measures\n\nMore than 8 in 10 gun owners said they are in favor of universal background checks for all gun sales, including private sales and at gun shows. That\'s similar to the almost 9 in 10 of all Americans who say so in other surveys.\n\nRoughly two-thirds or more are in favor of raising the minimum age to buy an assault-style weapon to 21 (72%), raising the age to buy any kind of gun to 21 (67%) and red flag laws (65%).\n\n""As a gun owner myself, both pistols and hunting rifles, I feel that it\'s important that background checks, red flag laws and raising the age should be something that we as a country should be doing,"" said poll respondent Christopher Montes of Connecticut.\n\nMontes, a self-declared independent, said there are simply too many guns in the wrong hands.\n\nRecently passed legislation expanded background checks on those between the ages of 18 and 21 looking to purchase a gun, offered incentives for states to pass red flag laws and eliminated the so-called ""boyfriend loophole,"" which expanded on a law that prevented spouses convicted of domestic abuse from owning a gun.\n\n""While this bill doesn\'t do everything I want, it does include actions I\'ve long called for that are going to save lives,"" President Biden said before signing the legislation.\n\nAmong other things, Biden wanted to see a return to a ban on AR-15-style semi-automatic weapons, the kind seen in recent mass shootings that can fire many rounds quickly.\n\nBut there is less support for an outright assault-style weapons ban among gun owners as opposed to other gun-control measures, with 55% opposed to such a ban. There was a sharp split by party, with 72% of Republican gun owners and a slim majority of independents (53%) opposed, and 84% of Democratic gun owners in favor.\n\nOther surveys, including ones conducted for NPR, have found majority support for this kind of measure when non-gun owners are factored in. There was a ban on such weapons for 10 years beginning in the mid-1990s. When it expired, mass shootings increased threefold.\n\n""I do support that [an assault-style weapons ban] because I think that we should be protecting our kids,"" said poll participant Lizzie, a 45 year old self-described conservative who lives in West Texas. She didn\'t want her last name used.\n\nShe said she\'s fed up with the horrific stream of mass shootings — at elementary schools, grocery stores, and Fourth of July parades.\n\n""We don\'t need to be losing kids like that,"" she added. ""They should grow up and be who they want to, and fulfill their dreams. You know, they\'re just too innocent to die so young.""\n\nFred, a 73 year old Republican gun owner in Bakersfield, Calif., agreed.\n\n""Get rid of the AR-15s, get rid of all of that kind of stuff, and do better background checks,"" he said. ""It\'s made for war. It is not made to hunt with, it is made to kill, okay? Regular people have no business owning them. That\'s part of the problem we have.""\n\nBut others disagree.\n\n""I\'m not for banning any of them,"" said Montes, the independent gun owner from Connecticut, who supports some gun-control measures. ""If they\'re going to ban again just ARs, that doesn\'t make sense. There are other high-powered, fairly high capacity guns that don\'t look like ARs. And so are you going to not ban those?""\n\nAmber, a Republican police officer from Pennsylvania, sees any AR-style ban as unnecessary and unconstitutional.\n\n""I don\'t believe in banning them because I believe that everyone should have the right to bear arms, who legally owns arms in the United States. I don\'t think we should take the right from American citizens who own guns legally, who should have guns.""\n\nWeapons, like machine guns and rocket launchers and other ""destructive devices,"" are technically legal at a federal level, but highly regulated and require strict background checks.\n\nAbout one in five gun owners say they own AR-15 style semi-automatic rifles, including a quarter of Republicans. When asked if ""people like me"" need to own such weapons, 45% of gun owners said no, while 35% said yes. But there was a big partisan split. Three-quarters of Democrats said no, but only about half of independents and a third of Republicans said no.\n\nThe numbers highlight the sharp partisan lines that emerge when it comes to more high-powered types of guns – and the difficulty in getting broad support to restrict them.\n\nBy far, pistols are what most respondents own (73%), followed by rifles (57%) and shotguns (56%). Most gun owners (70%) say they own more than one gun with a quarter saying they own six or more.\n\nPeople said they own guns mostly for their own protection (79%) or to protect their families (78%) and because they enjoy shooting for sport (54%).\n\nLess than half (46%) said it\'s because they\'re exercising their constitutional right to do so, though there was a partisan split on that with six in 10 Republicans saying that\'s why they do versus just 17% of Democrats. Democrats were also less likely to say they own a gun for sport (34%).\n\nDistrust of government\n\nDespite the potential support for some gun-control measures among gun owners, when you dig deeper there is a clear distrust of government, especially among Republicans, who make up the plurality of gun owners in the survey.\n\nJust a quarter of gun owners overall said they have trust in the federal government to look out for their best interests. (An even lower 16% said so of the news media.)\n\nA slim majority believe passing new gun control laws is a slippery slope toward taking away all guns. Three-quarters of Republicans thought so as did about half of independents.\n\nSixty percent of Republican gun owners said the government wants to take away all guns, and 55% of them said passing new gun control laws goes against their Second Amendment rights.\n\nNotably, the National Rifle Association doesn\'t have as much sway with gun owners as the group\'s power in Washington might suggest. Gun owners are largely split on the gun lobbying group, with 53% saying they have not very much or no trust at all in the NRA.\n\nAgain, there\'s a big partisan divide with three-quarters of Republicans saying they trust the NRA versus just a third of independents and 12% of Democrats.\n\nThe NRA has seen its share of troubles over the past couple of years, from internal strife to a lawsuit alleging self-dealing to filing for bankruptcy. Still, the group seems to control the narrative in response to mass shootings, from former President Trump on down to congressional Republicans.\n\nOverall, 61% think passing new gun laws won\'t do anything to stop mass shootings, including almost 8 in 10 Republicans and 56% of independents.\n\nNot surprisingly, most gun owners say it\'s more important to protect gun rights (56%) than control gun violence (43%), though there is a major partisan split – eight in 10 Republicans say it\'s more important to protect gun rights, while almost nine in 10 Democrats who own guns say the priority should be controlling gun violence.\n\nTheir top concern is like other Americans – inflation. Sixty percent said so. Political extremism and polarization were second (33%), followed by government budget and debt (27%), crime or gun violence, immigration and climate change (26% each).'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61591236', 'Headline': 'Where does US gun control go from here? - BBC', 'Snippet': 'Every recent mass shooting in America has been followed by an increasingly familiar political drama: Democrats call for new gun-control measures, such as a ban on assault-style weapons, and point out how the US is alone among industrialised nations in its high levels of gun violence.', 'Full_text': 'Every recent mass shooting in America has been followed by an increasingly familiar political drama: Democrats call for new gun-control measures, such as a ban on assault-style weapons, and point out how the US is alone among industrialised nations in its high levels of gun violence.\n\nRepublicans counter that the right to possess firearms is enshrined in the US Constitution and that new gun-control legislation would be counterproductive.\n\nThen, because of the nature of US government, little changes on a national level.\n\n""We have to do more to stop gun violence,"" US President Joe Biden said after the April mass shooting that killed six at a school in Nashville, Tennessee. ""It\'s ripping our communities apart.""\n\nBut doing more, at least on the national level, faces a number of serious obstacles.\n\nHere\'s a look at some of those challenges.\n\nOld roadblocks in Congress\n\nIn the weeks after 20 children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut in 2012, a majority of US senators supported passing legislation requiring expanded background checks for gun purchases.\n\nBut because of the filibuster - a parliamentary procedure that requires at least 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to pass most legislation - a simple majority was not enough.\n\nAfter another school tragedy in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022, the House of Representatives, then controlled by the Democrats, approved an assault-weapons ban but the measure stalled in the Senate.\n\nAlthough polls indicate majorities of Americans support such an effort, many Republican senators represent states with large pro-gun communities.\n\nAnd the Republican voters whose support lawmakers need to win primary elections (the selection process within each party) are even more opposed to reform. So unless sentiment shifts among that constituency, the Republicans are unlikely to change course.\n\nWith the House of Representatives back in Republican hands, it is more probable that the chamber will try to expand gun rights, not limit them.\n\nAt the state level\n\nAlthough congressional efforts at sweeping gun control were stymied in 2015, gun-control activists made substantive progress in passing new laws at the state level.\n\nIn Connecticut, for instance, there was overwhelming support for reform from the communities still reeling from the brutality of the Sandy Hook attack. Other Democratic-controlled states - like New York, Maryland and California - passed their own legislation, closing gun-show loopholes, limiting magazine sizes and prohibiting the sale of certain types of firearms.\n\nBut the states that have the political majorities to pass gun-control regulations have already done so. And in many Republican controlled states, the momentum on the gun issue is towards less regulation, not more. In April, Florida became the 26th state - all Republican - to allow its residents to carry a concealed handgun without a government licence.\n\nDemocratic politicians in those states, frustrated by the lack of progress, have cited recent school shootings as reason to act. Nashville Mayor John Cooper denounced what he called the ""cult of the gun"" in comments made shortly after his city\'s violence.\n\n""The country needs to pick itself up and say no to an assault weapons lobby that again is making it too available and too convenient and too first-of-mind for people to go out and commit terrible acts,"" he said.\n\nTennessee is one of the states with broad protections for permitless gun ownership - a fact that the state\'s national politicians have celebrated. In 2021, Nashville\'s congressional representative Andy Ogles sent a Christmas photo of his family in which all but the youngest child was carrying some type of firearm.\n\n""The very atmosphere of firearms anywhere and everywhere restrains evil interference - they deserve a place of honour with all that\'s good,"" the congressman said in a holiday message accompanying the photo online.\n\nCourts are another battleground\n\nEven if the political calculus changes in Congress or among states hostile to enacting gun-control legislation, there is a significant and growing obstacle to any attempts at reform - the courts.\n\nIn 2008, a narrow 5-to-4 majority in the US Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which says ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed"", guarantees a personal right to possess a handgun.\n\nThat interpretation, although subject to furious debate, has embedded gun ownership rights in the text of the Constitution itself. And since that decision, the courts have only become more supportive.\n\nOne of President Donald Trump\'s lasting legacies was to appoint hundreds of conservative judges to the federal courts, including naming three new Supreme Court justices.\n\nLast year, two Trump-appointed appellate court judges in California struck down a state law prohibiting the sale of assault rifles to those under the age of 21.\n\nThat opinion, if upheld by the Supreme Court, could be of particular relevance given that the perpetrators in Uvalde and Sandy Hook fall into that category.\n\n""America would not exist without the heroism of the young adults who fought and died in our revolutionary army,"" one of the judges wrote. ""Today we reaffirm that our constitution still protects the right that enabled their sacrifice - the right of young adults to keep and bear arms.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Biden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://news.gallup.com/poll/470588/dissatisfaction-gun-laws-hits-new-high.aspx', 'Headline': 'Dissatisfaction With U.S. Gun Laws Hits New High - Gallup.com', 'Snippet': 'Biden spoke about the need to pass further restrictions on gun ownership, including an assault weapons ban, in his State of the Union address earlier this month.

At the same time, satisfaction with gun policy has fallen by the same amount to 34%, tying the lowest reading on record.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nGallup has tracked Americans’ satisfaction with the nation’s gun policies in January of most years since 2001 as part of its Mood of the Nation poll, which also gauges satisfaction with a variety of aspects of policy and life issues. This year’s poll, which was conducted Jan. 2-22, found subpar satisfaction ratings across many of the measures, in addition to gun laws.\n\nIn 2001, Americans were only slightly more satisfied with U.S. gun laws than they are now, but in 2002 and 2003, they were evenly divided, and from 2004 through January 2012, more Americans were satisfied than dissatisfied. Attitudes shifted after the December 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, which claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults. Since 2013, majorities of U.S. adults have been dissatisfied, as mass shootings have continued in the U.S.\n\nIn 2016, the public’s satisfaction with gun laws dropped eight points to the 34% record low, while 62% were dissatisfied. (Most of the dissatisfied wanted stricter laws.) That 28-point gap was the largest for the trend until this year’s 29-point gap.\n\nThe latest increase in dissatisfaction comes in the wake of 2022, a year marked by the second-highest number of mass shootings in recent U.S. history, including two in May -- in a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, and an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. These two massacres were the impetus behind the passage of the first significant federal gun legislation in nearly three decades. The law is aimed at keeping firearms out of the hands of people who are a threat to public safety and provides funding for mental health services, school security and crisis intervention programs.\n\nThe bill passed with unanimous Democratic support in both houses of Congress along with 14 Republicans in the U.S. House and 15 Republicans in the U.S. Senate. Most congressional Republicans opposed the bill on the grounds that it would restrict Second Amendment rights. At the same time, President Joe Biden and many congressional Democrats said it didn’t go far enough in restricting guns.\n\nMass shootings in the U.S. continued through the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. Several occurred during the latest poll’s field period, including two in Half Moon Bay and Monterey Park, California. The massacre at Michigan State University occurred after the poll ended.\n\nSlim Majority of Republicans Satisfied, Most Democrats Dissatisfied With Gun Laws\n\nA majority of rank-and-file Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are very (17%) or somewhat (37%) satisfied with U.S. gun laws, while an 84% majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners are very (59%) or somewhat (25%) dissatisfied.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nSince 2001, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have been much more satisfied than Democrats and Democratic leaners with the nation’s gun policies. That gulf persists today, as 54% of Republicans and a record-low 14% of Democrats are satisfied. Republicans’ satisfaction has edged down five points over the past year, while Democrats’ has fallen nine points.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nBottom Line\n\nAmericans today are as dissatisfied with the nation’s gun laws as they have been in the past 23 years. That dissatisfaction is driven largely by Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, who likely agree with the president and many Democrats in Congress that the gun legislation passed last year didn’t go far enough.\n\nA majority of Americans continue to support stricter laws covering the sale of firearms, which has been the case for most years since the Sandy Hook School shooting, in contrast to opinions in the four years preceding it. Biden spoke about the need to pass further restrictions on gun ownership, including an assault weapons ban, in his State of the Union address earlier this month. Yet, the possibility of passing such a law in the near future seems remote. For now, any changes to gun laws are more likely to come from individual states, as they did in 2022.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on Twitter.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/26/politics/cnn-poll-gun-laws/index.html', 'Headline': 'CNN Poll: Most Americans want stricter gun control, but they’re divided ...', 'Snippet': 'Americans living in gun-owning households are more than twice as likely as those in non-gun owning households to say allowing owners to carry guns in public places would increase public safety, 47 ...', 'Full_text': 'Most Americans continue to say gun control laws should be generally stricter, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, which finds broad support for preventing people under the age of 21 from buying any type of gun. At the same time, the country remains closely divided about how the availability of guns affects public safety, with sharp differences in views across partisan and demographic lines.\n\nOverall, 64% say they favor stricter gun control laws, with 36% opposed, little changed since a survey taken last summer in the wake of a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.\n\nAbout one-third of Americans, 36%, say that the presence of guns makes public places less safe, while 32% say that allowing gun owners to carry their guns in public makes those places safer and the rest that it makes no difference to safety.\n\nJust over half the public, 54%, say they believe having stricter gun control laws would reduce the number of gun-related deaths in the country.\n\nPublic appetite for stricter gun laws has often tended to spike in the aftermath of high-profile mass shootings – but with the frequency of such incidents, that elevated support may have become somewhat more durable. CNN’s polling has found consistent majority backing for stricter guns laws since 2016, with 60% or more favoring tighter restrictions in every survey to ask the question since the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThere’s also been a sustained shift over the past decade in the intensity of opinions, which now consistently and substantially favor gun control advocates. In CNN polls conducted between 2013 and 2017, strong support for stricter gun laws outpaced strong opposition by an average margin of only 5 percentage points. In the years following the Parkland shooting, that margin has surged to an average of 30 points.\n\nIn the latest survey, strong support for gun control laws among the full public stands at 46%, while strong opposition stands at 20%. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to hold intensely felt views: 80% say they strongly support stricter laws, nearly doubling the 42% of strong opposition among Republicans.\n\nViews on enacting stricter gun control laws are also sharply polarized overall. A majority of Democrats (92%) and independents (65%) support new restrictions compared with 36% of Republicans. By contrast, there’s relatively little of an age divide, with 67% of adults younger than 45 and 62% of older adults in favor.\n\nGun ownership also divides views, with 76% of those living in households without guns saying they support stronger laws, compared with 45% among those who live in a gun-owning household. Americans living in gun-owning households are more than twice as likely as those in non-gun owning households to say allowing owners to carry guns in public places would increase public safety, 47% to 22%.\n\nRepublican men also stand out for their perspectives. Nearly three-quarters, 72%, say they believe guns make public places safer, a view shared by just under half of Republican women (48%), and one-third or fewer of Democrats or independents of either gender. And 73% of Republican men oppose stricter gun laws, compared with 55% of GOP women, and fewer than half of any other group.\n\nMost Americans, 58%, say the government can take actions that would be effective in preventing mass shootings, compared with 42% who say shootings will happen regardless of what action the government takes. Opinions on this question divide along both partisan and age lines: 66% of Republicans and 51% of adults age 45 and older see mass shootings as inevitable, while fewer than one-third of Democrats or those younger than 45 say the same. Both Republicans and independents younger than 45 are significantly more bullish than their older counterparts about the potential for government action, while there’s effectively no divide between older and younger Democrats.\n\nThe White House gets low marks for its approach to gun policy. Just 30% of Americans approve of President Joe Biden’s handling of the issue, down 7 points from March and significantly below his current overall 40% job approval rating.\n\nThe poll finds near-universal public support, at 94%, for a proposal to prevent certain people, such as convicted felons or people with mental health problems, from owning guns, up 7 points from 2018. Support for a proposal to prevent people younger than 21 from buying any type of gun stands at 80%, up 9 points from five years ago. A smaller 59% majority of Americans favor a ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of rifles capable of semi-automatic fire, such as the AR-15, a number that’s relatively unchanged from 2018 – but up 10 points from the year prior.\n\nMost Republicans oppose a ban on rifles capable of semi-automatic fire, while most Democrats support it. Support for the other two proposals crosses partisan lines, with 94% of Democrats, 80% of independents and 66% of Republicans all favoring a ban on gun sales to people under 21. More than 9 in 10 of Democrats, independents and Republicans alike support bans on gun ownership for felons and people with mental health problems.\n\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from May 17-20 among a random national sample of 1,227 adults drawn from a probability-based panel.

In most of these places, Biden’s ratings are higher than those of his predecessor in the White House, Donald Trump, but lower than his own ratings in 2021.\n\nHere are six charts on what people in surveyed countries think of Biden, based on polls conducted in each nation in the spring of 2022.\n\nA median of 58% of adults across 18 countries say they have confidence in Joe Biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs.\n\nConfidence in Biden varies widely by region and country. In Europe alone, the share of adults who offer a positive rating of Biden ranges from 82% in Poland to just under a third (31%) in Hungary. In the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea and Japan stand out with 70% and 62% of adults, respectively, saying they have confidence in the U.S. president. Opinion is more divided in Malaysia, Australia and Singapore.\n\nIn Israel, six-in-ten adults say they have confidence in Biden, though fewer than half attach positive descriptors to him like “strong leader” (41% say this about him), “caring about ordinary people” (36%) and “charismatic” (27%).\n\nConfidence in Biden has dropped significantly in most places surveyed in 2021 and 2022. The share of adults who have confidence in Biden on the world stage has decreased by double digits in 13 of the 14 countries surveyed in both years. In Italy, Greece, Spain and Singapore, half or more now have little or no confidence in the U.S. president. Still, in most places – including key European countries – confidence in Biden remains higher than confidence in Trump. Israel is the one exception: While 60% of Israelis have confidence in Biden, 71% said the same about Trump in 2019.\n\nOlder adults generally have more confidence in Biden than younger adults. In most countries surveyed, adults ages 50 and older are more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to have confidence in Biden. For example, nearly three-quarters of Belgians ages 50 and older give Biden positive ratings on the world stage, compared with roughly half of Belgians ages 18 to 29. Double-digit differences also exist in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, South Korea, Sweden, Japan and France.\n\nIn Hungary, Italy and Poland, the opposite pattern appears: Younger adults are more likely than older adults to have confidence in Biden.\n\nThere is more public approval than disapproval of Biden’s choice to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan – but low ratings of the withdrawal itself. A median of 52% of adults across 18 countries surveyed say it was the right decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while 39% say it was the wrong decision. Responses vary by region, and in Poland, Israel, Japan and Hungary, roughly two-in-ten do not offer a response.\n\nAcross all 18 countries, a median of just a third of adults (33%) say the withdrawal was handled well. Far more (median of 56%) say it was not handled well.\n\nAmericans’ views of the decision to withdraw troops, as well as the execution of the plan, are largely aligned with views from around the world. Six-in-ten Americans say it was the right decision, while 38% hold the opposite view. And roughly a third (32%) say the withdrawal was handled well, whereas two-thirds (66%) say it was not.\n\nIn places where the U.S. is seen more favorably, so is Biden. For example, the two countries surveyed where people have the most favorable views of the United States – Poland and South Korea – are also among the countries where people have the most confidence in Biden.\n\nIn nearly all countries surveyed, more people express a favorable view of the U.S. than confidence in Biden – though the opposite is true in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and Malaysia. In Germany and Australia, the share of adults with a positive view of the U.S. and confidence in Biden are roughly the same. This pattern holds at the individual level as well: Favorable views of the U.S. correlate with positive ratings of Biden.\n\nConfidence in Biden is similar to confidence in other Western leaders. A median of 58% of adults across the 18 surveyed countries have confidence in Biden’s handling of global affairs, just a few points lower than the median share who say the same about French President Emmanuel Macron (61%) and equal to positive ratings of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (58%). Larger shares, however, say they are not confident in Biden than say the same of his German counterpart.\n\nWithin specific countries, there are greater differences in ratings of the three leaders. In Poland and Israel, for instance, larger shares are more confident in Biden than either of his European counterparts, while in Greece, it is Macron who receives the highest ratings.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/20/politics/joe-biden-birthday-81/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden’s birthday prompts debate about age and wisdom of America’s ...', 'Snippet': 'John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, suggested that Biden’s experience – particularly in the foreign policy realm – is a positive.', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden is marking his 81st birthday milestone Monday with a low-key family celebration as he braces for a strenuous election year ahead.\n\nBut even as the first family keeps the celebrations muted and out-of-sight, the moment nevertheless highlights his greatest campaign liability – his advanced age and, along with it, perceptions among voters that his physical and mental fitness have declined.\n\nOn Monday morning, as he presided over the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon, Biden seemingly confused pop stars Britney Spears and Taylor Swift.\n\nBeing the national Thanksgiving turkey, he said, is “harder than getting a ticket to the Renaissance tour or Britney’s tour she on -– it’s kind of warm in Brazil right now,” appearing to confuse Spears with Swift, who is currently on the South America leg of her Eras tour.\n\nHe also offered multiple jokes about his age.\n\n“I just want you to know it’s difficult turning 60 – difficult,” he told the turkey pardon audience, laughing. And as he noted the 76th anniversary of the event, he joked that he “wasn’t there” at the first edition. Later, a picture on Biden’s Instagram feed showed him posing with a birthday cake ablaze with candles. “Turns out on your 146th birthday, you run out of space for candles!” the president said in the post.\n\nOfficials at the White House and the campaign privately acknowledge age is a vulnerability, and they work both to eliminate potential gaffes and project vigor. Biden was prescribed custom orthotics to help with his feet this year, after his annual physical determined that he experiences a “stiff gait.” In recent months, when Biden flies on Air Force One, he has started using a smaller, shorter set of stairs more frequently to board and deplane.\n\nBiden has also made an effort to pass reporters on bike rides during vacations in Delaware, occasionally stopping to take questions while clad in his helmet. (The president is an avid user of Peloton at the White House.)\n\nStill, the age liability comes into sharper focus almost by the day. A spate of recent polling, including a new CNN poll, indicates it’s a chronic issue with voters. And critics raise it every chance they get. On Saturday, former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, called Biden “a stupid person” who “can’t get off this stage … by the time whatever it is he’s taking wears off,” prompting cheers from a crowd in Fort Dodge, Iowa. On Sunday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, 45, remarked that “Father Time is undefeated,” naming age as an issue for both Biden and Trump, 77, in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nBiden already is the oldest president in history, ahead of Ronald Reagan, who was 77 at the end of his second term. If elected in 2024, Biden would be 86 at the end of his second term. Trump, who would be approaching 83 at the same point, would take the baton for oldest president in history if elected.\n\nBiden advisers argue – and grumble – that there’s a double standard, with media coverage more focused on Biden’s age than Trump’s. Still, they insist that voters are focused on other issues and that age won’t be a deciding factor next November.\n\n“I don’t think the campaign should be focused on anything but the winning record,” said Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California, a member of the Biden campaign’s national advisory board. “Everything else about people’s biographies or when their birthdays are – that doesn’t matter. People want to know, what did they do, and what are they going to do?”\n\nOn Monday, Biden’s birthday milestone will pass with little fanfare. His day is set to include the time-honored pre-Thanksgiving tradition of the annual turkey pardon. He is also expected to receive briefings from his national security advisers on global crises.\n\nThe campaign isn’t ignoring Biden’s birthday, aides told CNN. A Democratic National Committee official tells CNN there are plans to commemorate the occasion with a post to social media, as the party has done every year since 2011, except in the three years when he was a candidate or prospective candidate.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is also urging supporters to sign a virtual birthday card for the president.\n\nBiden and Trump both try to finesse the question of age\n\nThe former president, who has openly criticized Biden on just about everything, has shown unusual restraint when it comes to directly attacking the president’s age.\n\nIt’s a topic of sensitivity for both men, and Trump seems aware of the perils of contrasting himself with Biden over their exact age difference – which is three years and five months. In a recent interview, Trump avoided attacking Biden’s age directly.\n\n“He’s not too old, he’s incompetent,” Trump told Megyn Kelly in an interview on her eponymous Sirius XM show last month.\n\n“Age is interesting because some people are very sharp and some people do lose it, but you lose it at 40 and 50 also,” he went on. “But no, he’s not too old at all. He’s grossly incompetent.”\n\nIn turn, the Biden campaign has begun to signal it’s not afraid to go there, too.\n\n“Is Donald Trump okay?” an official Biden campaign account said in a post to social media platform X earlier this month. It featured a mash-up video of Trump gaffes, including confusing the city he was in, calling former President Barack Obama his “leading political opponent” and mixing up the home country of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.\n\nFor his own part, Biden sometimes laughs off his age.\n\n“I don’t look it, but I’m 180 years old. I’ve been around a long time,” he joked to donors at a recent fundraiser.\n\nBut mostly, he and other officials frame his age as a source of wisdom and experience.\n\n“I have more experience than any president has in the history of the United States,” he said at another fundraiser. “One of the things that comes with age, hopefully, is wisdom.”\n\nJohn Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, suggested that Biden’s experience – particularly in the foreign policy realm – is a positive.\n\n“I’ve never seen the world more turbulent, and at a time like this, when things are as turbulent and uncertain and in some cases – frightening – as they are right now, you want somebody at the helm who has seen the world, who has developed the relationships with world leaders, who has experienced problems akin to these over and over and over again, and who understands the history behind where we are today,” Kirby told CNN.\n\nBiden “brings to the foreign policy helm a steady hand and wisdom and experience,” Kirby said. “That is irreplaceable.”\n\nWhite House aides also point to the president’s capacity to participate in strenuous trips and high-stakes meetings with world leaders as evidence of his stamina. He often leaves his colleagues exhausted, they say.\n\nKirby pointed to instances of Biden pressing his colleagues to add events or engagements to jam-packed schedules. He added a call with the Emir of Qatar Friday morning ahead of meetings at the APEC summit in California. He also added an impromptu gaggle with reporters on Air Force One following a grueling trip to Tel Aviv, Israel, last month.\n\nPolling woes and ‘Father Time’\n\nPolls show the question persists. In an August AP-NORC Poll, 77% of respondents agreed with the assessment that Biden is too old to effectively serve another four-year term as president, while 51% of respondents said the same of Trump.\n\nIn a national CNN poll conducted by SSRS earlier this month, just 25% of registered voters say Biden has the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president, while 53% feel Trump does.\n\nAnd in the newer CNN poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire, 56% of likely Democratic voters in the Granite State mentioned the president’s age when asked to name their biggest concern about Biden as a candidate.\n\nWhen New Hampshire adults more broadly were polled on a list of the candidates’ personal attributes, Trump fared worse on each (temperament, honesty and integrity, policy positions, decision-making abilities) than Biden – except physical and mental fitness.\n\nA majority of voters – 58% – offered a poor assessment of Biden’s physical and mental fitness, compared with 53% who gave Trump poor marks. Still, those numbers reflect clear concerns from voters on the issue for both candidates.\n\nThere is, of course, the possibility that Biden could square off with a different opponent in the general election. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is in second place in the New Hampshire GOP primary poll, has proposed “mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old.”\n\nThe view from a younger generation\n\nThe president’s age is often one of the first topics to come up in conversations with young voters – often as a subject of questions about whether he’s up to the job.\n\n“I don’t want to say it’s his age alone that could be a deterrent for young voters,” said Kerry Singleton, a senior at Morehouse College in Atlanta. “I will say it’s the delivery on the promises that were given to a lot of the young voters.”\n\nRachael Carroll, who graduated last year from Clark Atlanta University, said she believes Biden is from another era, where he doesn’t understand the progressive views of many Democratic voters.\n\n“No offense, but yes, it’s a little old to me,” Carroll said, adding that Trump’s age should be of equal concern to Americans. “They don’t understand what we’re going through now because we’re living in two completely different times.”\n\nNabilah Islam Parkes, who last fall became the youngest woman elected to the Georgia state Senate, said she doesn’t believe age is the overriding concern about Biden. She said questions about the administration’s handling of the Middle East – and his worldview – are far more pressing.\n\n“As long as we feel like he reflects our values,” she said, “age shouldn’t be an issue.”\n\nAnd progressive groups working to mobilize young voters said that they do not think Biden’s age will ultimately be a significant factor in whether young voters show up for him at the polls.\n\n“It’s so low on the list of things we think about it and things that are actually impacting our lives,” said Jack Lobel, national press secretary for Voters of Tomorrow, an organization that focuses on Gen Z voters. “It’s not a primary concern.”\n\nCNN’s Jeff Zeleny, Camila DeChalus, Kristen Holmes, and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2023/06/27/international-views-of-biden-and-u-s-largely-positive/', 'Headline': 'International Views of Biden and U.S. Largely Positive', 'Snippet': 'Overwhelmingly, people believe the U.S. interferes in the affairs of other countries (82%), but most also believe the U.S. contributes to peace and stability around the world (61%). U.S. President Joe Biden receives mostly positive reviews from publics around the world with 54% expressing confidence in Biden, while 39% say they lack confidence in him.', 'Full_text': 'Most say U.S. interferes in affairs of other countries, but also contributes to peace and stability\n\nIn the third year of his presidency, U.S. President Joe Biden receives mostly positive reviews from publics around the world. Across 23 countries in a new Pew Research Center survey, a median of 54% express confidence in Biden, while 39% say they lack confidence in him.\n\nSimilarly, overall views of the United States are largely positive: A median of 59% give the U.S. a favorable rating, including around seven-in-ten or more in Poland, Israel, South Korea, Nigeria, Japan and Kenya. Hungary is the only country surveyed where fewer than half see the U.S. favorably.\n\nAmerica’s actions on the world stage have often shaped its global image, and as the survey highlights, public opinion about U.S. foreign policy is often complex, with people seeing both positive and negative sides to American power. Overwhelmingly, people believe the U.S. interferes in the affairs of other countries – a median of 82% say it does this a great deal or fair amount – but most also believe the U.S. contributes to peace and stability around the world.\n\nInternational public opinion is essentially divided over how much the U.S. considers the interests of other countries when it is making foreign policy decisions. However, in roughly half of the nations surveyed, the share of the public that thinks the U.S. does consider other countries is higher than it has ever been since Pew Research Center started asking this question more than two decades ago.\n\nThe survey also explores other aspects of American power, including elements of U.S. soft power. America’s technology, universities, military and entertainment are all seen as being the best or above average when compared with other wealthy nations, although the U.S. receives mixed reviews for its standard of living.\n\nPerceptions of American economic power have increased in several countries over the past few years, and respondents tend to name the U.S., rather than China, as the world’s leading economic power. However, in a number of European countries, as well as Australia, China is considered the top global economy.\n\nThese findings come from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted from Feb. 20 to May 22, 2023, among 27,285 people in 23 countries, many of which are key U.S. allies. Below are some of the other findings regarding America’s overall image, ratings of Biden, views of U.S. foreign policy, American soft power and American economic power.\n\nOverall ratings for the U.S.\n\nAmong the countries surveyed, Poland, where positive views of the U.S. have increased substantially since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, gives the U.S. its highest rating: 93% of Poles express a favorable opinion. The U.S. gets its lowest marks in another central European country: Hungary, where just 44% of adults offer a positive view, down from 55% in 2022.\n\nElsewhere, views of the U.S. have mostly remained stable since last year, although favorable ratings have declined somewhat in Sweden, South Korea, Canada and Germany.\n\nThe current study includes eight middle-income nations that Pew Research Center has not surveyed since 2019, before the outbreak of COVID-19, due to the challenges of conducting face-to-face interviews during the pandemic. In all eight countries, there has been a significant increase in U.S. favorability since 2019. This is similar to the pattern found in Pew Research Center surveys over the past several years, which documented a decline in America’s global image during Donald Trump’s presidency and a rebound in ratings for the U.S. following the election of Joe Biden.\n\nAttitudes toward Biden\n\nAs with ratings for the U.S. overall, Biden gets his highest marks in Poland, where 83% voice confidence in his leadership of world affairs. Roughly seven-in-ten or more also express confidence in Biden in Sweden, Kenya, Nigeria, Israel, the Netherlands and Germany. Majorities in about half of the countries polled give Biden positive ratings, although opinion of Biden is, on balance, more negative than positive in NATO allies Italy, Greece, France and Spain. And he gets his lowest ratings in Hungary.\n\nIn middle-income nations in Latin America, Africa and Asia, Biden receives significantly higher marks than his predecessor. For instance, 44% of Brazilians have confidence in Biden, compared with 28% for Trump in 2019. And in some countries where Trump was relatively popular, ratings for Biden are higher. For example, 71% of Nigerians say they have confidence in Biden, up from 58% for Trump four years ago. And 64% of Indians give Biden positive marks, compared with the 56% voicing confidence for Trump in 2019.\n\nAmerica’s role on the world stage\n\nSince 2002, we have periodically included a question asking respondents whether they believe the U.S. takes into account the interests of countries like theirs when making foreign policy decisions. And typically we’ve found that people do not think the U.S. considers their interests.\n\nViews are divided in the current survey, with a median of 49% across 23 countries saying the U.S. takes into account their interests a great deal or fair amount, and 50% saying it considers their interests not very much or not at all.\n\nHowever, in many nations, the share of the public that thinks the U.S. listens to countries like theirs has been on the rise, and in 12 countries, it is at the highest point we’ve seen in any of our surveys. For instance, in Poland, Germany and the United Kingdom – three key NATO allies of the U.S. – the share saying the U.S. considers their interests is larger now than at any point over the past two decades.\n\nIn addition to the question on whether the U.S. considers other countries’ interests, the survey included two other questions about America’s role in global politics. First, we asked about how much the U.S. interferes in the affairs of other countries. Second, we asked about how much the U.S. contributes to peace and stability around the world.\n\nLooking at the two questions together highlights the complex views people often hold about the U.S. and the ways in which people see both positive and negative aspects to the role America plays on the world stage.\n\nA median of 50% across the 23 nations surveyed say both that the U.S. interferes a great deal or fair amount in the affairs of other countries and that it contributes a great deal or fair amount to peace and stability around the world.\n\nAbout one-in-three believe the U.S. interferes but does not contribute to global peace and stability. Half or more have this position in Greece, Hungary and Italy.\n\nRelatively few believe the U.S. does not meddle in the politics of other nations.\n\nAmerican soft power\n\nThe survey included a number of questions on social, political and economic aspects of America’s image – things that are often considered a part of U.S. “soft power.”\n\nFor instance, when asked how politically stable, dangerous, democratic, religious and tolerant the U.S. is, respondents generally say it is about the same as other affluent nations. But a sizable number believe the U.S. is more politically stable, including half or more in Poland, Nigeria and Israel. Still, four-in-ten or more see the U.S. as less stable in Australia, Sweden and the Netherlands.\n\nWhile on the negative side, many think it is a less tolerant and more dangerous place to live compared with other wealthy countries. Nearly two-thirds of Australians believe the U.S. is a more dangerous place to live, and at least half hold this view in the UK, Spain and Germany.\n\nRespondents generally think America’s technology, entertainment, universities and military are the best or above average when compared with other affluent nations.\n\nThe U.S. receives lower marks for its standard of living, although 51% say it is the best or better than average.\n\nAs a separate analysis shows, only 44% of Americans think the United States’ standard of living is the best or above average. Americans are also less likely than others around the world to praise their technological achievements and universities.\n\nYounger adults are especially likely to embrace U.S. popular culture. In 18 nations, adults ages 18 to 39 are more likely than older adults to say American movies, music and television are the best or above average.\n\nFor instance, 84% of Greeks under 40 say American entertainment is the best or better than average, compared with 62% of those ages 40 and older.\n\nWhile young people are more positive than older adults about American entertainment, they express greater concerns about safety in the U.S.\n\nIn 12 nations, those under 40 are particularly likely to say the U.S. is a more dangerous place to live than other wealthy nations. In the Netherlands, for example, 61% of 18- to 39-year-olds say the U.S. is more dangerous, while just 34% of those 40 and older agree.\n\nU.S. economic power\n\nThe global economy has experienced a number of severe shocks in recent years, with many nations suffering recessions after the outbreak of COVID-19, followed by high inflation as the world emerged from the pandemic. There has also been a shift over the past few years in perceptions of global economic power. In several countries, people have become more likely to name the U.S., rather than China, as the world’s top economy.\n\nOverall, a median of 41% across the 23 nations polled believe the U.S. is the world’s leading economic power, while 33% name China. The share who say the U.S. is the world’s leading economic power has increased significantly since 2020 in Germany, Sweden, Japan, France, Canada and the Netherlands.\n\nIt has also increased in Indonesia, Hungary, Poland and Nigeria since 2019, the last time the question was asked in those countries.\n\nThe survey also includes a question in middle-income nations about American investment in their countries. Across eight nations, a median of 68% say U.S. investment has benefited their countries’ economies a great deal or a fair amount. Assessments are especially positive in Nigeria, Kenya, India and Mexico, where seven-in-ten or more hold this view. Argentina is the only nation polled where a majority believe U.S. investment has been bad for their country.\n\nSpotlight: America’s image improves in Mexico\n\nSince we last surveyed Mexico in 2019, there has been a sharp turnaround in Mexican attitudes toward the U.S. During Trump’s presidency, ratings for the U.S. declined significantly in many nations across the globe, including Mexico, where Trump and his policies – especially his proposal to build a wall on the border with Mexico – were extremely unpopular. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the share of the Mexican public that expressed confidence in Trump was in the single digits and the lowest rating for Trump each year in our annual cross-national survey was in Mexico.\n\nToday, Biden’s ratings in Mexico are not especially high – 43% have confidence in him – but they are considerably higher than Trump’s were, and they are in line with the assessments Barack Obama received when he was in the White House. Similarly, overall ratings for the U.S. have rebounded to roughly where they were during Obama’s second term.\n\nSpotlight: Differing views of the U.S. in central Europe\n\nIn recent years, Poland and Hungary have featured prominently in discussions about the rise of populism in Europe. Both countries have governments controlled by right-wing populist parties – Law and Justice (PiS) in Poland and Fidesz in Hungary – both have had tensions with the European Union over domestic policies and both have experienced a deterioration in the quality of their democracy according to research organizations such as International IDEA, the Economist Intelligence Unit and Freedom House.\n\nHowever, the two countries look very different when it comes to public opinion about international affairs, including views about the U.S. Poles have generally had relatively favorable attitudes about the U.S. in our surveys over the past two decades, but since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Polish attitudes have become even more positive. And in the current survey, Poles are consistently at or near the top of the list, in terms of expressing positive views about the U.S.\n\nHungarians, in contrast, are consistently at the bottom. They give Biden his lowest rating, and Hungary is the only country where fewer than half have a favorable opinion of the U.S. They are the least likely to think the U.S. considers their interests when making foreign policy and the most likely to believe the U.S. does not contribute to peace and stability around the world. Often, these negative views are especially common among supporters of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party.\n\nRoad map to the report\n\nThe chapters that follow discuss these findings and others in more detail:\n\nChapter 1 looks at overall opinion of the U.S. across the countries surveyed, including how perceptions have shifted over the years\n\nChapter 2 examines confidence in U.S. President Joe Biden to do the right thing in world affairs and how ratings of Biden compare with those of former presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama\n\nChapter 3 considers the negative and positive roles the U.S. plays in international affairs'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.thewrap.com/joe-biden-age-comment-cnn-interview-clip/', 'Headline': 'Joe Biden Addresses Age Concerns on CNN, Says He Has Wisdom - The Wrap', 'Snippet': ""President Joe Biden addressed concerns over his age while interviewing with CNN's ...

But two aspects of its report stand out.\n\nOne is its sedulous adherence to the “both sides do it” press narrative, in which every action by one party must be paired with an ostensibly equivalent action by the other party.\n\nThen there’s the juvenile snarkiness of the report, which takes pains to point out that the “bonus” of Biden’s taking “policy-focused presidential trips” is that “the campaign doesn’t have to cover expenses.”\n\nOf course: What better reason to take a four-day international jaunt of 15,000 miles round-trip than to save his presidential campaign a few bucks? (Does anyone doubt that if Biden skipped the G-20 summit, Axios would be asking whether his age had something to do with his staying home?)\n\nFinally, the age thing. From the level of coverage this issue is getting in the press, one would think it’s the only important consideration out there.\n\nNever mind that one of these candidates has been indicted for allegedly plotting to destroy American democracy — Axios both-sides that issue by noting that “Biden’s presidential duties and Trump’s legal battles are limiting their ability to campaign,” as if serving the public interest and undermining the public interest are merely two sides of the same coin.\n\nAlso, of course, Biden at 80 is only three years older than Trump (77), and appears to be more physically active.\n\nReportage like this makes one doubt that the political press is up to the task of responsibly covering what could be a historically pivotal presidential election. In 2024 the race won’t feature two candidates with differing, but arguably sound, policy ideas, but one whose commitment to public policy is manifest, and another whose disdain for democracy is plain.\n\nAs long ago as 1992, it became clear that American campaign coverage was becoming consumed with inanity. That was the year, it may be recalled, when a major campaign theme was tied up with George H.W. Bush’s unfamiliarity with a supermarket scanner. The nugget was exploited to paint Bush as an elitist hopelessly out of touch with the ordinary American — never mind that the episode had been misreported from the start and was not corrected until years later.\n\nSince then, campaign coverage has gotten only more stupefied. That’s because, for campaign reporters (and I’ve been one), policy is complicated and therefore boring. It’s much easier and more exciting to boil every contest down to who’s-ahead-today-and-who’s-behind horse race metrics, leavened by the memes that allow reporters to portray themselves as knowing insiders.\n\nIf a candidate’s team questions the veracity of the meme, one can always respond, “Well, that’s what your opponents are saying and you can’t blame us for reporting that.”\n\nEvery race since 1992 seems to have been reduced to a premasticated nugget. In 2000, it was Al Gore’s claim to have “invented the internet.” In truth, that’s not what he said, and in any case he had indeed played a key role in advancing the legislation and funding that made the internet happen. Too bad for Gore: The meme became shorthand for the notion that he couldn’t be trusted.\n\nIn 2016, it was the claim that Hillary Clinton had used a private email server as secretary of State, supposedly placing national security at risk. This was always a fatuous issue, but since Trump was pushing it relentlessly the press went along, even though there was much more evidence that Trump was the one whose behavior threatened national security.\n\nThis time around, the age meme is accompanied by the claim that Americans are hopelessly polarized. As I’ve written before, there’s no evidence for that, and plenty for the contrary. The truth is that Americans favor, often by a supermajority, abortion rights and stricter gun controls.\n\nBiden’s economic initiatives also are broadly popular — so much so that GOP office-holders have scurried to groundbreakings to take credit for projects funded by Biden’s 2021 infrastructure bill, even though congressional Republicans voted overwhelmingly against it.\n\nBiden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time and capped insulin prices for Medicare patients, provisions that are plainly good for consumers and broadly popular, passed without a single Republican vote in either chamber.\n\nYet the “polarization” meme is harder to kill than a television zombie. What’s worse is that the press and political commentators blame both parties equally for driving Americans apart.\n\nConsider a recent report by the American Political Science Assn., which asserted that the issue that divides Americans more than any other is race.\n\nIn the report’s preface, Mark D. Brewer of the University of Maine asserts that “today’s Republican and Democratic Parties have evolved to a place where they emphasize difference, stoke fear and animosity, and incite conflict.”\n\nThat’s a classic both-sides construction, but is it so? Not according to the report’s text. There, one finds scant evidence that the Democrats “stoke fear and animosity,” much less “incite conflict.” Do they “emphasize difference”? Given that the theme of much Democratic politicking is racial and ethnic inclusiveness and a welcoming of gender diversity, that can’t be true.\n\nIn the report itself, Zoltan Hajnal of UC San Diego writes that the Democratic Party publicly embraced “the basic goals of the Civil Rights Movement” while the GOP, through its “Southern Strategy” to exploit white resentment of Black rights in that region, “abandoned over a hundred years of racial progressivism.”\n\n(Rather churlishly, I thought, Hajnal ascribes the Democrats’ commitment to civil rights to a desire to grub votes “by giving Blacks access to the vote.” Perhaps the Democrats just thought that giving all citizens access to the vote was the right thing to do.)\n\nMore to the point, Lilliana Mason of Johns Hopkins University writes that because the GOP’s positions on policies such as abortion, gun control, healthcare and infrastructure spending “run contrary to the majority of public preferences,” the party tries to “take advantage of identity-centric rhetoric — which can motivate voters without offering them economic or practical benefits.”\n\nMason quotes the outstanding political scientists Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson as observing that “to deliver to the plutocrats yet still win elections, Republicans reached ever deeper into ... segments of the electorate where conservative economic policies failed to stir voters’ passions but divisive appeals to identity did.”\n\nThat doesn’t sound as if both sides are equally guilty of stoking fear and animosity and inciting conflict.\n\nOne other popular meme in the political press is that in Biden the Democrats are saddled with a deeply unpopular standard-carrier. This is another extremely dubious assertion beloved of lazy political commentators.\n\nAs Kevin Drum points out, Biden’s job approval (42%, according to Gallup) is right in line with those of Trump (42%), Obama (40%), Reagan (44%) and Clinton (46%) at this stage of their first terms. All of them, except Trump, went on to second terms.\n\nThe consequence of the press’ fixation on the issue of Biden’s age despite his evident capability for governing is that public opinion will be skewed in Trump’s favor, even as some of Trump’s fellow Republicans have begun to question his fitness for office (not to mention those, er, “legal battles,” as Axios would have it).\n\nThe importance of the press in reporting fairly and incisively on the issues at large in the coming presidential election is inescapable. So far, its failure has become more evident with every passing day. Time is getting short for it to turn itself around.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65389142', 'Headline': ""How Joe Biden's campaign hopes to overcome his age problem - BBC"", 'Snippet': ""And in the end, the age issue was a non-factor in Mr Biden's victory over Mr Trump.

This time around, Mr Biden will enjoy the benefits of ..."", 'Full_text': 'Time waits for no man, the saying goes - and for 80-year-old Joe Biden, that could be a problem. Can the US president convince voters that his age is not an issue?\n\nMr Biden announced on Tuesday that he wants to serve another four years in the White House. Americans, according to a recent NBC News poll, aren\'t so sure.\n\nThe survey shows that 70% of Americans - and 51% of Democrats - think he shouldn\'t seek re-election. And it identifies one major concern for about half of those who want him to stand aside in 2024: his age.\n\nMr Biden is already the oldest president in US history. If he were to win re-election, he would be inaugurated at age 82 and finish his second four-year term at 86. According to US government actuarial tables, the average life expectancy for an 82-year-old man is 6.77 years, with an 8% chance of death within the next 12 months.\n\nThe video, which broadly outlines his plan to protect ""personal freedoms"" and warns against threats posed by his Republican opponents, does not tackle the age issue head on. Instead, it intersperses cuts of an animated president - jogging here, looking engaged there - set to swelling instrumental music.\n\nThe video also repeatedly highlights Vice-President Kamala Harris, who would take over the presidency if Mr Biden were incapacitated. At 58, the Biden team may hope her presence injects a bit of life and energy into the campaign. Then Vice-President Biden, it should be noted, was missing from Barack Obama\'s 2012 re-election video.\n\nThe video is not going to be enough, according to veteran political consultant Bob Shrum, director of the Center for the Political Future and a former senior adviser to the presidential campaigns of Democrats Al Gore and John Kerry.\n\n""You answer age questions by running a vigorous campaign,"" Mr Shrum said. ""You don\'t answer it by talking about it.""\n\nHe added that the age issue will only become a problem if Mr Biden has a ""serious"" mistake or stumble on the campaign trail. And if that\'s the case, the Republicans - who are already trying to amplify every Biden gaffe - will be ready to make the case that Mr Biden is no longer fit for the presidency.\n\nLast year, 54 Republicans in the House of Representatives signed a letter to the White House expressing ""concern"" about Mr Biden\'s cognitive state and demanding that Mr Biden take a dementia test.\n\nThe letter went on to list a number of Biden missteps and misstatements during his presidency.\n\n""These recent gaffes are not isolated incidents, as they are part of a larger history of your actions which exemplify cognitive decline,"" the letter read.\n\nThese kind of pointed ""concerns"" have been echoed by Donald Trump, who is currently the leading contender for the Republican 2024 presidential nomination. At political rallies in the run-up to the midterm congressional elections last year, Mr Trump frequently played a video for the crowd of Mr Biden\'s various gaffes and stumbles.\n\n""Joe Biden can\'t speak clearly,"" Mr Trump said when introducing the video at an October rally in Arizona. ""He can\'t think clearly.""\n\nAccording to Jim Messina, who ran Barack Obama\'s 2012 re-election campaign, Democrats may be counting on Mr Trump - who is only four years younger than Mr Biden - to help defuse the age issue.\n\n""Voters say, look, they\'re both old,"" Mr Messina told the BBC Americast podcast. ""Tell me who\'s going to make my life better.""\n\n""Democrats do one thing every night,"" he continued. ""We sit down, and we get on our knees, and we pray to God that Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president.""\n\nMr Biden also faced questions about his age four years ago, although the nature of the presidential race in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic helped insulate the candidate from some of the exposure that comes with a national primary and general election campaign. And in the end, the age issue was a non-factor in Mr Biden\'s victory over Mr Trump.\n\nThis time around, Mr Biden will enjoy the benefits of campaigning as the incumbent president. That includes travel on Air Force One and attending political events that are meticulously planned not just by professional campaign staff but also by the president\'s extensive security detail.\n\nIt is a very different type of experience to what non-incumbent candidates must face. His rivals will have to battle through primaries in the snows of New Hampshire and Iowa, often running on shoestring budgets and competing in a crowded field which can take more than a year to vanquish.\n\nAnd if there were a bit of silver lining to the NBC poll showing a national reluctance to embrace Mr Biden\'s re-election bid, it\'s that if Mr Biden does run again, 88% of Democrat said they would definitely or probably support their candidate.\n\n""Biden is always underestimated,"" Mr Shrum said. ""Biden was underestimated in 2020. People wrote him off after the first couple of primaries, and then he went on to win the primaries by a landslide.""\n\nFind out more\n\nYou can hear more of Anthony\'s analysis by tuning into Americast, the BBC\'s US politics and culture podcast, on BBC Sounds or wherever you get your podcasts'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65381555', 'Headline': ""Older Americans weigh in on President Joe Biden's age - BBC"", 'Snippet': 'The US President Joe Biden is already the oldest man to serve in the office.

Most people understand that 80 (and 77) are just too old to maintain the general good health, energy, vigor, and resilience required for the job of president of the United States. It’s time for the older generation (I’m [a member] myself) to hand over leadership to younger people, while still able to provide guidance and wisdom.\n\nI have the utmost respect for Joe Biden as president and as a person. He’s an honorable, intelligent, empathetic man who works hard, understands complex policy matters, respects the rule of law, and cares about people. If he were even 70 I’d support a second term. However, 2024 is an election year with enormous implications for the future, and the Democrats need to eliminate all obvious obstacles to winning. Poll after poll tell us that a majority of voters think Biden’s age is a deterrent to a second term. If Biden were to announce his retirement now, explaining that he loves his job but wants to put country first and hand over leadership to a younger person, we could celebrate his service and properly honor him. It would be an opportunity to outline his successes and he would leave with a fine legacy as a long-serving senator, a two-term vice president, and a one-term president who saved us from a disastrous alternative. He could offer valuable guidance and support to a new candidate to carry on his agenda.\n\nThat seems like a no-brainer, win-win situation. So why are the clear preferences of the (Democratic) public being ignored? Are the Democratic Party leaders convinced that there is something shameful or embarrassing in voluntarily stepping aside after one term? Do they really believe that there are no viable candidates available, but that some will magically appear by 2028 (actually 2025, when the next cycle will really begin)?\n\nI certainly don’t want to see a chaotic, nasty primary battle. We have no time for that sideshow. My wishful thinking is for the Democrats to organize so that just three or four people run in a primary. No candidate over 62. No don’t-have-a-chance-but-love attention-pols. No self-funded-billionaire vanity candidates. Yes, this part is fantasy, but one can dream.\n\nClearly, Biden does not plan to step aside. That fact is very important to this question. Pundits like to dream of a field of new candidates energizing American voters to deliver a landslide Democratic victory. I have no problem with these dreams. But I do strongly doubt that a challenger would improve the party’s chances of success. My opinions on Biden have changed: He now has an objectively good track record in office. He passed the IRA and CHIPS. That’s quite a departure from the previous bipartisan consensus that climate change should be fought with big speeches and empty international agreements. He has avoided slip-ups and health scares much more successfully than his Republican opponents. Importantly, he now presides over a much more prosperous country than the one he took over. The labour market is stronger. Jobs that previously paid minimum wage now pay much more. Inflation has chilled out.\n\nThe argument against Biden claims to stand on two legs: polls and age. I do not think it stands at all. Polls show that a narrow majority disapproves of Biden. I believe this is because people have much more black-and-white views of politicians than they did in the past. Biden certainly upholds policies that I see as objectively evil. If you asked me the binary question of whether I approved or disapproved, I would probably choose the latter. But I still believe he has performed better than at least 3/5 of the men who came before him, and took office in the midst of a much more challenging situation than most of his recent predecessors. I suspect that years of constantly being bombarded with Important Bad News conditioned a lot of Americans who previously looked at presidents holistically to share my outlook. I don’t think that's necessarily a bad thing. It just makes “approve/disapprove” polls a bad metric for deciding whether a president is electable.\n\nThen there’s his age. I generally accept that age and mental fitness are meaningful. I do not accept that the mental difference between a 78-year-old and an 82-year-old is unfathomably large. People have spoken at length about Biden’s age, but none of their promised aneurysms and embarrassing international incidents have come to fruition. Biden seems a lot more mentally fit than the younger, fresher Republican candidates promising to dismantle the entire government. He seems a lot less embarrassing than Ron DeSantis.\n\nIt is noticeable and under-reported that American progressives have largely stopped calling for challengers. The reason is simply: Biden has listened to and implemented the “new ideas” they pushed for. Most calls for challengers no longer want those challengers to bring never-before-tried proposals to the table; they want younger challengers who will return the party to its centrist recent past. (The choice of “centrist” over “conservative” is intentionally charitable.) But their arguments about Biden’s electability do not hold water, and their certainty that a super moderate candidate can win in America is misplaced. The Democrats will not face a moderate, they will face a demagogue. They need their young, passionate base more than ever. Returning to tradition (what a silly way to describe ousting an incumbent president) is the wrong move.\n\nJoe Biden is a big-time winner and never was defeated in a national government election. He won his first election for the Senate in 1972 and went on to win his Senate seat six more times. He won as Obama’s vice president two times. Then he won his primary in 2020 and went on to win about a million more votes than his opponent. And this opponent is likely to be his adversary in 2024. Sure, people think he’s old and he is. But is he too old? It’s political suicide to think of replacing a candidate with his history.\n\nThe vice president should take one for the team and for the American people. She should find a good reason to make an honorable decline of the nomination in 2024. The outcome of this election is too risky to take a chance on someone with such low poll ratings. Find a personable, well-qualified governor or someone on that level and nominate him or her as Joe Biden’s vice president. That’s the way to make Joe Biden’s age a no-problem. As long as people know that if, God forbid, Biden should have a time when he won’t be able to fulfill his duties, there will be a strong Democrat ready to take over immediately, Biden will be able to ignore any questions about his age.\n\nDemocrats should stick with Biden for this reason: He did what I thought was impossible and made politics boring again. I can kick up my feet and enjoy my days and nights without being inundated with Biden’s latest speech or attention-grabbing hot take. He’s careful not to come out and refute or endorse whatever wacky things the left or right have to say at any given moment. Biden is old, yes, but guess what? Jimmy Carter’s still alive. And I don’t care if he flubs a line or two on some occasions––if people on the inside say he’s doing just fine handling the main duties of the presidency, that’s good enough for me. He got us out of Afghanistan. It was messy and awful, but it was done when so many before had just hand-waved and procrastinated. Unemployment is low, we have the respect of other Western nations again, and, I can’t stress this enough, I’m so glad that I can ignore the president. Let him run again and give me four more years of not waking up in the morning wondering what the president said.""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/12/politics/joe-biden-age-presidency-what-matters/index.html', 'Headline': 'People are talking about Biden’s age again | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'Beating back age questions in 2020 Biden overcame many younger Democratic candidates to win the nomination in 2020, when the top priority for many voters was simply to defeat Trump.', 'Full_text': 'A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

Biden is an outlier in the US for being a President who has lost two children, but he has a son who is 52 and a daughter who is 41.\n\n25, 30, 35\n\nThere is an arbitrary feeling to the age minimums set by the Constitution. Starting with the minimum age of 25 set for members of the House, the framers added five years for senators and five more for president.\n\nThey set no age requirements or other specific qualifications for Supreme Court justices, including length of service, which is why the new conservative majority could be ensconced for generations.\n\nThe argument to step aside\n\nWhile the Constitution allows for old presidents, political pundits are increasingly loud about questioning the wisdom of a Biden run for reelection.\n\nThe Atlantic writer Mark Leibovich wrote a plea in June titled, “Why Biden Shouldn’t Run in 2024,” for the President to bow out after one term. His argument was that the President is too old, although Leibovich was ashamed to admit it.\n\n“It all feels impolite to point this out—disrespectful, ageist, and taboo, especially given the gross Republican smears about Biden being a doddering and demented old puppet,” Leibovich wrote. “No one wants to perpetuate this garbage.”\n\nThis weekend, The New York Times writer Peter Baker took a more analytical look at Biden’s age, reporting how the President spends most weekends at home in Delaware and calibrates his schedule to avoid especially long foreign trips and to tamp down on evening appearances.\n\nMany presidents live very long lives\n\nBiden doesn’t turn 80 until November and could well have decades of life ahead of him.\n\nNo US president has lived to 100, but recent presidents have all lived very long lives.\n\nJimmy Carter is the longest-living former President, a 97-year-old cancer survivor. Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford all lived into their 90s. But all these men enjoyed long retirements: 15 years for Reagan, 25 for Bush, nearly 30 for Ford, and 41 and counting for Carter.\n\nWe’ve seen this movie before\n\nThe oldest presidents often face questions about their fitness, typically in the form of whisper campaigns from their political rivals.\n\nDonald Trump, who was in his 70s as President, frequently saw his temperament questioned. Reagan ultimately developed Alzheimer’s disease, but allegations that he showed symptoms in his final years in office have never been proven.\n\nRELATED: Reagan didn’t have Alzheimer’s while in office\n\nRunning into their 80s\n\nBiden’s old Senate colleagues routinely run for reelection in their 80s.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley of Iowa is running for reelection, and he turns 89 in September.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who is the subject of ageist questions about her fitness, recently turned 89, and her term lasts until the 2024 election.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, on the other hand, decided last year when he was 81 not to run for reelection.\n\nOther senators like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Richard Burr of North Carolina seem downright young for planning to retire from the Senate while in their 60s.\n\nDecades at the top\n\nNancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn, all in their 80s, have been top Democrats in the House since 2002.\n\nIf Democrats lose control of the House after November’s midterm elections, it would be an obvious moment for the party to begin looking to a new generation of leaders.\n\nThe facts vs. the smears\n\nWhen The Atlantic column urging Biden not to seek reelection was published in June, CNN’s John Harwood tried to separate the valid questions about aging from the false and politically damaging idea that Biden is not cogent and capable.\n\n“What’s true is the presidency is a hugely taxing job mentally and physically, and Joe Biden is old,” Harwood said on “Reliable Sources.” He added: “He doesn’t talk or walk as smoothly as he once did.”\n\nWhat is not true is the trope pushed in conservative media that Biden is not currently mentally capable of doing the job. The President is engaged and acute, Harwood said.\n\nMajorities have concerns\n\nWhen I asked CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy for recent examples of public opinion on Biden’s age, she provided multiple examples of majorities of Americans thinking Biden’s advanced age is an issue:\n\nDiscomfort with Biden’s age extends to Democrats as they look to the next presidential election:\n\nBeating back age questions in 2020\n\nBiden overcame many younger Democratic candidates to win the nomination in 2020, when the top priority for many voters was simply to defeat Trump. Voters will have other things on their minds in 2024, particularly if Trump is not a candidate or does not win the GOP nomination.\n\nEdwards-Levy also argued that people’s attitude toward politicians’ ages can often be at least partially a reflection of how they feel about that candidate more generally.\n\nIn other words, Biden’s age is a problem so long as Biden is not popular.\n\nOr, as Harwood said last month, “Joe Biden would look a little bit younger if he was at 50% (approval) than at 40%, but he’s not – and so he’s going to have to deal with these stories for some time.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/us/politics/biden-age-health.html', 'Headline': 'President Biden Is Turning 80.

If the government intervenes, the relator (the official designation of the whistleblower) can expect 15-25% of the amount the government recovers. The highest recorded payout to a whistleblower is $32 million. And if the government agrees with Jackson, her payout could be substantially more.\n\nThe Key Players\n\nPfizer Inc. - is the manufacturer of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. On August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the vaccine as safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 for individuals 12 or older. The vaccine is currently marketed under the name Comirnaty. The FDA ruled no problem with the data submitted, and no criminal fraud was committed.\n\nVentavia Research Group (VRG) - The independent lab tested the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. According to their website, they have eight locations in Texas: Houston, Fort Worth, Plano, Arlington, Keller, Burleson, Weatherford, and Grapevine. They have just under 100 employees and have performed clinical trial research since 2013.\n\nThe FDA has not taken any action against Ventavia and fully accepted the data from the vaccine testing performed at Ventavia facilities. Wouldn't it make sense if there was an actual problem that the FDA would have taken action? But they didn't.\n\nBrook Jackson - Known as The COVID-19 Pfizer Whistleblower who reported her findings to the FDA on September 25, 2020. Jackson states she has audio recordings and copies of company documents backing up her claims about how VRG conducted the vaccine trial.\n\nOne photo allegedly shows needles used in the vaccine trial had been discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of the approved sharps container box. It is unclear if the used needles were poking through the plastic bag creating a potential injury to anyone handling the bag or near it. Another photo shows the potential of unblinding the participants as the completed vaccine packing materials contained the trial participants' identification numbers, which were out in the open instead of in a secured location.\n\nDoes this sound like criminal fraud to you? Does it paint a picture of a lack of training? Yes. How about that when overworked employees often make mistakes they wouldn't under normal circumstances? That would be probable.\n\nPaul Thacker - the reporter responsible for breaking the story, is described as an American journalist who has reported on science, medicine, and the environment. He has just 16k followers on Twitter. Does that seem like a lot to you? And according to Science.org, fake news is shared 70% more often on Twitter than real news.""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9893920/', 'Headline': 'Facebook versus the BMJ: when fact checking goes wrong', 'Snippet': 'The Lead Stories article said that none of the flaws identified by The BMJ’s whistleblower, Brook Jackson, would “disqualify” the data collected from the main Pfizer vaccine trial.

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

That means all the Pfizer vaccine data should be public by the end of September rather than the year 2097, the deadline that the FDA wanted.\n\n“Here, the court recognizes the ‘unduly burdensome’ challenges that this [Freedom of Information Act] request may present to the FDA,” the court ruling noted. “But, as expressed at the scheduling conference, there may not be a ‘more important issue at the Food and Drug Administration … than the pandemic, the Pfizer vaccine, getting every American vaccinated, [and] making sure that the American public is assured that this was not rush[ed] on behalf of the United States.”\n\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION REQUESTS SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD VACCINE-OR-TEST MANDATE\n\nPittman’s ruling requires the FDA to start producing documents at an expedited pace — more than 12,000 pages before Jan. 31.

On the exact same day, pharmaceutical behemoth Pfizer announced it will raise the price on its COVID jab by about 400%. Commenting on this move by the CDC, Dr David Wiseman, a PhD research bioscientist with a background in pharmacy, pharmacology, immunology and experimental pathology, said, “Despite assurances from ACIP members that the addition of COVID-19 vaccines to the VFC and Immunisation Schedule did not constitute a mandate, there is every danger that local authorities will be emboldened by these additions to impose work or school mandates.” The ACIP’s vote is a punch to the gut given that vaccines recommended for children will receive automatic immunity from liability, including when the vaccine is administered to an adult.

Instead, they’re going to make up the difference through price hikes which, ultimately, will be paid by government and insurance companies\n\nMeanwhile, a judge is about to rule whether Pfizer and other COVID jab makers can be held accountable for fraud. In January 2022, Pfizer whistleblower Brook Jackson filed a lawsuit against Pfizer for committing fraud against the American people. In February, the judge ruled that the lawsuit could proceed to the pretrial discovery phase. It is now on the verge of potentially going to trial\n\nAccording to a legal analyst, the U.S. Congress has, over the past 30 years, paved the way for legalised tyranny and even genocide. What were once state and/or federal crimes have been legalised, and the reason the Food and Drug Administration is not protecting the public from what is clearly the most dangerous “vaccine” the world has ever seen is because it’s part of a biowarfare program run jointly by the FDA, Health and Human Services, the Defence Department, the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Pfizer, Moderna and the World Health Organisation\n\nOctober 20, 2022, the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (ACIP) unanimously (15-0) voted to add unlicensed COVID-19 shots to the U.S. childhood, adolescent and adult vaccine schedules.1\n\nBy adding the shots to the vaccine schedule, the CDC is securing Pfizer’s and Moderna’s permanent liability shield so that no one can sue them for damages for injuries and deaths occurring as a result of the shots. It also opens the door for states to mandate the jab for school children.\n\nThe very same day, Pfizer announced it will raise the price on its COVID jab by about 400%,2 from $303 per jab to somewhere between $110 and $130 once the current U.S. purchase program expires.\n\nWhile in direct opposition to how capitalism normally works, Reuters4 claims significant price hikes were predicted5 by Wall Street analysts “due to weak demand for COVID vaccines, which meant vaccine makers would need to hike prices to meet revenue forecasts for 2023 and beyond.”\n\nAs noted by comedian Jimmy Dore in the video above, normally, in a free market economy, when demand goes down, prices are reduced. Not so in this case, though.\n\nPfizer has already forecasted expected revenues into the foreseeable future, and they’re not going to let real-world market demands dictate its revenue stream. No, they’re simply going to make up the difference through price hikes which, ultimately, will be paid by government and insurance companies.\n\nBy increasing their price by 400%, Pfizer is tipping its hand that its projections for vaccine uptake will decrease by the inverse or 75% as this would allow them to continue to earn their obscene profits. In other words Pfizer believes that COVID jab uptake will only be 25% of what it was under the emergency use authorisation (EUA).\n\nIndeed, to help ensure profits keep rolling into Big Pharma’s pockets as forecasted before public demand fell off a cliff, ACIP has also added to the shots to the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program,6 which provides vaccines to children at no or low cost using federal funding.7\n\nPfizer revenue is expected to reach $101.3 billion in 2022,8 thanks to the COVID jab and Paxlovid, and with that kind of revenue stream, you can be sure they’ll lobby states to mandate the shot for school children like they’ve never lobbied before.\n\nJudge About to Rule on Pfizergate\n\nMeanwhile, a judge is about to rule whether Pfizer and other COVID jab makers can be held accountable for fraud. As reported by Becker News:9\n\n“The last shred of hope for holding Big Pharma accountable for fraud now rests on a lawsuit against vaccine manufacturer Pfizer. In an update provided to Becker News, a judge is soon expected to issue his ruling on whether or not the ‘Pfizergate’ fraud case proceeds to trial.\n\n‘The judge is deciding … whether we go to discovery or the case is dismissed,’ Pfizer whistleblower Brook Jackson tells Becker News. After the CDC this week voted to add the COVID shots to its Childhood Vaccines Schedule, under the PREP Act, it has effectively been granted legal immunity to lawsuits.\n\nThere is no legal immunity if Pfizer committed fraud, however. In September, Pfizer whistleblower Brook Jackson came forward with her explosive report about the company’s alleged malfeasance, citing ‘falsified data’ and manipulated clinical trials.10\n\nIn January, she filed a lawsuit against Pfizer for committing fraud against the American people. In February, the judge ruled that the lawsuit, being led by attorney Robert Barnes, can proceed to the pre-trial discovery phase. It is now on the verge of potentially going to trial.”\n\nPfizer has filed a motion to dismiss, which the U.S. government supports. As explained by legal analyst Katherine Watt:11\n\n“Pfizer’s core argument in its Motion to Dismiss, which the US Government has now endorsed in its Oct. 4 statement of interest, is that clinical trials and clinical data from all of the sites, including the serious adverse event reports from the very start of the trials in Summer 2020, were not ‘material’ or ‘necessary’ to the FDA’s decisions to grant Emergency Use Authorization (Dec. 11, 2020) and approval (Aug. 23, 2021) to Pfizer’s product.”\n\nJust how can clinical trial data, including adverse event reports, be immaterial and unnecessary to the FDA’s EUA decision? Is this not an admission — both by Pfizer and the U.S. government — that the FDA colluded with Pfizer to get the shots to market without regard for safety? That’s what it sounds like to me.\n\nCDC Director Contracts COVID\n\nAs you may have heard, CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky tested positive for COVID October 21, 2022, despite being up to date on her boosters. She received her fifth shot, the latest bivalent booster which has only been tested on mice, on September 22.12\n\nExactly one month later, she’s “experiencing mild symptoms” and is “isolating at home.”13 14 So, not only did the bivalent shot fail to protect Walensky, it failed in just four weeks.\n\nBack in March 2021, Walensky went on record stating that CDC data “suggest that vaccinated people do not carry the virus.”15 Four months later, a CDC investigation of an outbreak in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, which occurred July 6 through July 25, 2021, found 74% of those who received a diagnosis of COVID-19, and 80% of hospitalisations, were among the fully vaccinated.16 17\n\nThe CDC also found that fully vaccinated individuals who contracted the infection had just as high a viral load in their nasal passages as unvaccinated individuals who got infected.18 In other words, the jabbed were determined to be just as infectious as the unjabbed. At this point, the list of instances where Walensky has been proven wrong is a long one.\n\nThe More Shots You Get, the More Likely You’ll Die of COVID\n\nTo those actually analysing and paying attention to the data — which Walensky apparently must not be doing, or else she wouldn’t be going to a public pharmacy to get injected for the fifth time — her COVID diagnosis is no surprise.\n\nAs noted by Dr. Charles Hoffe in a September 15, 2022, interview with Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, “The more shots you get, the more likely you will die from COVID-19.” An excerpt from the interview is included above. You can find the full interview on Bitchute.19\n\nAccording to the latest data from Canada, summarised by Hoffe, 85% of Canadians have received at least two COVID shots, and in June 2022, 92% of all COVID deaths were in fully jabbed individuals. And, while only 34% of Canadians had received three or four doses, they made up 81% of all COVID deaths in the month of June:\n\n“This is the clearest evidence that the more shots you have, the more likely you will die of COVID,” Hoffe said. “These [shots] are severely damaging the immune system. And so, the discrimination against those who have chosen to be vaxx free is absolutely absurd because those are the people who are going to survive.”\n\nThe Legal Architecture for Genocide\n\nIn closing, many of us have wondered just how the FDA, CDC and other governmental agencies can act with impunity and get away with what is essentially murder.\n\nWell, in a June 2022 interview20 with Dr. Jane Ruby of “The Jane Ruby Show,” Watt, the paralegal whom I quoted earlier, explained how the U.S. Congress has, over the past 30 years, slowly but surely paved the way for legalised tyranny and even genocide.\n\n“According to Watt, the reason the Food and Drug Administration is not protecting the public from what is clearly the most dangerous ‘vaccine’ the world has ever seen is because it’s part of a biowarfare program run jointly by the FDA, Health and Human Services, the Defence Department, the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Pfizer, Moderna and the World Health Organisation.”\n\nIn short, what were once state and/or federal crimes or human rights violations have been legalised through statutory revisions. Watt also describes in an April 28, 2022, Substack article how this regulatory framework grew into being.21 As noted in that article:\n\n“The basic goal of the architects, which has been achieved, was to set up legal conditions in which all governing power in the United States could be automatically transferred from the citizens and the three Constitutional branches into the two hands of the Health and Human Services Secretary, effective at the moment the HHS Secretary himself declared a public health emergency, legally transforming free citizens into enslaved subjects …\n\nCongress and US Presidents legalised and funded the overthrow of the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. government and the American people, through a massive domestic bioterrorism program relabeled as a public health program, conducted by the HHS Secretary and Secretary of Defence on behalf of the World Health Organisation and its financial backers.”\n\nIn another article titled “COVID-19 Injectable Bioweapons as Case Study in Legalised, Government-Operated Domestic Bioterrorism,” Watt explains why the FDA is not protecting the public from what is clearly the most dangerous “vaccine” the world has ever seen, by any metric whatsoever:22\n\n“FDA is not pulling the EUA products from the market or stopping the ‘vaccination’ campaign because Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and FDA Commissioner Robert Califf are running the US government’s bioterrorism program jointly with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Department of Justice Attorney General Merrick Garland, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Majorkas, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel, and World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.”\n\nHow to Protect and Restore Our Rights and Freedoms\n\nIn her April 28 article,23 Watt lays out a plan for how to build a case “to prosecute members of Congress, presidents, HHS secretaries and federal judges for treason under 18 USC 2381.” Less drastic measures presented by Watt during her interview with Ruby include:24\n\nSpeaking out against and educating other about how the tyranny is being implemented to prevent it from getting worse — something professor Mattias Desmet has been recommending\n\nGetting the U.S. out of the WHO and not funding it anymore\n\nCongress could repeal the statutes that put this framework into place, or implement oversight to rein in the HHS, which is the institutional structure that is running this overthrow scheme, or dissolve the HHS altogether\n\nGiven enough political pressure the HHS could also voluntarily roll back the regulations that form the framework for legalised tyranny and bring back Nuremberg Code principles. For example, informed consent principles have been nullified, which is what has enabled mask and vaccine mandates. Those regulations need to be reversed and informed consent principles reinstated\n\nFederal judges also need to start hearing Constitutional cases, which they’ve so far rejected\n\nState legislatures can also consider secession to protect the Constitutional rights of their residents\n\n1.

This longitudinal study considered a comparative evaluation of COVID-19 containment ...', 'Full_text': 'The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic unleashed extraordinary challenges on humanity. Governments implemented various policies aimed at containing the spread of infection and stabilizing their economies. Many institutions—including the Economist Intelligence Unit1, Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)2, NLI Research Institute3, and Bloomberg4—have assessed global responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, evaluation criteria differ across these institutions (Supplementary Information 1–3), and their studies have had different focuses and produced varying evaluation results.\n\nHere, we introduce a set of criteria for assessing virus-containment effectiveness, where the aim of containment is to minimize harm to societies and economies. The proposed criteria include several previously examined indicators, namely monthly cases per 100,000 members of a population (per capita), fatality rate, and GDP loss. Additionally, because OxCGRT\'s stringency index (SI)2 cannot reflect rigor accurately based on monthly case numbers (Supplementary Information 4), we propose a lockdown efficiency (LE) parameter, which relates stringency to incidence5 (Supplementary Information 5). We include the following five OxCGRT indicators of health-system policies2: public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, facial coverings, and (from December 2020 onward) vaccination policy.\n\nTo track long-term impacts on health literacy and mental health, we collated data from Google searches for “wash hands”, “face mask”, and “insomnia” as surrogates for national population health literacy and mental health. Surveys on COVID-19–related mental health and health literacy are mostly based on self-reported, cross-sectional studies and rarely multinational6. However, population health literacy and mental health trends have been shown to be reflected in search volume trends7,8. The search engine analysis website Google Trends has been used for population mental-health surveillance as well as for long-term tracking of depression9 and suicide10.\n\nThe availability of COVID-19 vaccines cast new hope for curbing the pandemic. Until August 19, 2021, the World Health Organization had issued only emergency-use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines11. By September 12, 2021, 42% of the worldwide population had received at least one dose of a vaccine12. Therefore, we incorporate vaccine-related indicators into our research.\n\nWe propose a set of ten indices, including four government policy and hygiene education (GP&HE) indicators and six vital health and socioeconomic (VH&SE) measures. Our research is divided into pre- and post-vaccine availability phases. For the first phase (March 2020 to November 2020), we focus on evaluating the appropriateness of the LE indicator, which we developed using linear mixed models to determine how each GP&HE indicator correlates with each VH&SE measure. In the second phase during which there was ongoing vaccine distribution (December 2020 to November 2021), we added vaccine-related indicators to enable more comprehensive containment performance analyses. We compared indicator scores for 50 distinctly governed territories.\n\nOur scoring system, modified from previous studies2,3, includes GP&HE indicators and VH&SE measures. The GP&HE indicators include: LE; health-system policies; health literacy indicators; and vaccine coverage of the population (December 2020 onward). The VH&SE measures include: one-month cases per capita; infection growth rate; fatality rate; GDP loss due to the pandemic; unemployment rate; and psychological impact (Table 1)2,5,13,14,15.\n\nGP&HE indicators\n\nGovernment response is associated with COVID-19 incidence2. Our newly introduced indicator LE is calculated based on COVID-19 incidence data and the SI2, a factor that does not account for COVID-19 incidence. LE has a reasonable correlation with one-month cases per capita (Supplementary Information 4 and 5).\n\nWe developed another indicator called health-system policies, which is a simple average of the four OxCGRT indicators: public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, and facial coverings2. Each of these indicators is derived from daily data, and thus could potentially be represented with monthly means or modes. We used monthly modes as the representative score for each month. From December 2020 onward, we added OxCGRT vaccination policy2 to the calculation of the health-system policies indicator.\n\nHealth literacy is beneficial to reducing the spread of infectious diseases7. Therefore, Google Trends were used to obtain search trends for “wash hands” and “face mask”, which act as surrogate indicators of health literacy7 (Supplementary Information 6).\n\nFor the second phase of the research (December 2020–November 2021), we added the aforementioned indicator people covered by vaccines15 by modifying the calculation of health-system policies to include vaccination policy. This indicator was calculated as the ratio of the number of vaccine doses administered to the number of doses required for full vaccination. For simplicity, we assumed that every individual in each country needs only two doses of vaccine.\n\nVH&SE measures\n\nNLI Research Institute definitions of one-month cases per capita, infection growth rate, and fatality rate were adopted3. Unemployment rate and GDP loss were defined relative to the same timeframe in 2020–2021 and 2019–2020 (Table 1). We quantified change in searches for “insomnia” to indicate the extent of the pandemic’s impact on a population’s mental health. Searches for insomnia have been used to assess the mental impact of COVID-198,16,17 more commonly than searches for anxiety, panic attack17,18, depression8, or suicide8.\n\nCorrelation analyses\n\nIn phase one, linear mixed models were used to explore the relationship between each GP&HE indicator and VH&SE measure. Because these values vary over time and may affect each other, we conducted two-stage analyses (Supplementary Information 4). We tested LE and SI legitimacy2. In phase two, we calculated Spearman\'s rank correlation coefficients to determine whether the indicator “people covered by vaccines” correlates with three vital health indicators, namely one-month cases per capita, infection growth rate, and one-month case fatality rate.\n\nScoring of GP&HE indicators and VH&SE measures\n\nWe ranked the performance of 50 countries and territories according to total indicator scores (Supplementary Information 7 and 8), where a higher score implies better containment performance. We graphed the score distribution (Supplementary Figs. S11-S31) to visualize the relationship between pre-pandemic baseline risk levels and monthly containment scores. We assigned all 50 countries and territories to low, medium, or high baseline risk categories and calculated monthly average containment scores for each risk level (Supplementary Information 9).\n\nGeographic comparison\n\nWe calculated monthly average containment scores for six geographic group and conducted two-sample t-tests and Mann–Whitney U-tests to compare containment performance between Latin American and non-Latin American countries and between Asian and non-Asian countries prior to vaccine introduction (Supplementary Information 10 and 11). Additionally, we compared mean containment performance scores before versus after inclusion of vaccine indicators (Fig. 2).\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted via SAS software (version 9.4); P values were two-tailed with 0.05 significance level.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nWe conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our study results in relation to uncertainties in the indicator calculation methods and the inclusion/exclusion of Google Trends indicators. Nine scenarios were evaluated (e.g. daily score means vs. modes; see Supplementary Table S35). The results obtained with different methods of calculating indices are given in Supplementary Tables S36–S40. Revised calculations with the inclusion of Google Trends are reported in Supplementary Tables S41–S44. The results obtained with the main scenarios (as defined in Table 1) are shown in Supplementary Tables S45 and S46, with the former including Google Trends indicators and the latter excluding Google Trends indicators. For the sensitivity analysis, we compared: (1) data in each of Supplementary Tables S36–S40 to the results in Supplementary Table S46; (2) data in each of Supplementary Tables S41–S44 to the results in Supplementary Table S45; and (3) data in each of Supplementary Tables S36–S39 to data in respective Supplementary Tables S41–S44 (i.e., Supplementary Table S41 vs. Supplementary Table S36, Supplementary Table S42 vs. Supplementary Table S37; Supplementary Table S43 vs. Supplementary Table S38; Supplementary Table S44 vs. Supplementary Table S39).\n\nEthical approval\n\nThe institutional review board of the National Health Research Institutes approved this study (EC1091110-E-R1).\n\nComparison between LE and SI prior to vaccine availability\n\nTwo-stage linear mixed models revealed no reasonable relationship between OxCGRT’s SI and one-month cases per capita (Supplementary Information 4). For each unit increase in the SI in July 2020, the estimated one-month cases per capita in August 2020 increased by 7.83 people (P = 0.03; Supplementary Table S2). Similar trends are observable for other months, contradicting the expectation that an increase in government policies in month s should reduce case numbers in month s + 1.\n\nFor every unit of increase in LE (defined in Table 1) in month s, the estimated one-month cases per capita in month s + 1 decreases. For each unit of increase in LE in September and October 2020, one-month cases per capita in October and November 2020 decrease by 629.55 and 597.94 people, respectively (both P < 0.0001; Supplementary Table S3). Although the relationships between LE and one-month cases per capita are not statistically significant in other months, we observe a consistent downward trend in cases subsequent to lockdowns.\n\nFrom our analyses, we deduce that our LE indicator is legitimate, and that the SI does not have a reasonable correlation with one-month cases per capita. Therefore, we use LE as an indicator in our subsequent evaluation.\n\nTwo stage-linear mixed models also show that the health-system policy in month s does impact fatality in month s + 1 within some periods of time. For every unit of increase in health-system policies in April and May 2020, fatality rates in May and June 2020 decrease by 7.84% and 3.86%, respectively (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table S4).\n\nCOVID-19 containment effectiveness\n\nPerformance scores for citizens’ health literacy and insomnia (Google Trends data) for six territories over the 21-month study period are shown in Fig. 1. All monthly COVID-19 containment rankings and scores from March 2020 to November 2021 are shown in Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 and in Supplementary Tables S13–S33 (Supplementary Information 8 and 12). The best performing countries and territories in 2020 are located mainly in Asia and Oceania, including Taiwan, the Republic of Korea (Korea), and New Zealand.\n\nBaseline risk\n\nLow- and middle-baseline-risk territories are concentrated in Asia, including Vietnam, Korea, and Taiwan, whereas high-baseline-risk nations are located mostly in Europe, including France and the UK. Countries in the Americas span the three risk levels (Fig. 3a). In the first phase, most low- and middle-baseline-risk countries and territories achieved better containment than their high-risk counterparts. Some countries, such as New Zealand and Finland, were able to restrain COVID-19 transmission despite having high baseline risk levels (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Information 9 and Supplementary Fig. S32a).\n\nGeographical comparison prior to vaccine allocation\n\nPrior to vaccine distribution, Latin America was severely impacted by the pandemic, while Oceania and Asia had good containment (Fig. 4a). Non-Latin American nations achieved better overall containment performance than their Latin American counterparts, which were severely affected. From April 2020 to September 2020, performance differed between these two groups, with and without Google Trends data inclusion (P < 0.027; Supplementary Information 10).\n\nAsian governments outperformed their non-Asian counterparts in phase one (Supplementary Information 11). From March to November 2020, with the exception of July 2020, performance scores of Asian countries were higher than those of non-Asian countries, with and without Google Trends data inclusion (P < 0.039).\n\nAsian countries performed dramatically better than non-Asian countries in LE and health-system policies early in the pandemic (April 2020 LE scores P = 0.007; March/April 2020 health-system policy scores P < 0.003). These results suggest that Asian governments enacted effective policies early (Supplementary Information 11).\n\nScoring system robustness\n\nSensitivity analyses revealed that (1) changing indicator calculation methods and (2) adding Google Trends indicators altered overall rankings slightly (Supplementary Information 13).\n\nPerformance after vaccine distribution\n\nThe best performers in 2020 were mostly in Asia and Oceania, including Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Thailand, and New Zealand. After vaccine indicators are included, the containment performance scores of these countries decrease. Inclusion of vaccine indicators from December 2020 onward results in higher containment performance scores in Singapore, Peru, Chile, Colombia, and Argentina (Figs. 2, 3b,c and 4). Among the six geographic regions analyzed, North American countries have the highest vaccine coverage. Their containment performance improves rapidly when vaccine indicators are included. Similar improvements are observed in Europe and Latin America (Fig. 4). Most high-baseline risk countries benefit from their high vaccination coverage (Supplementary Fig. S32).\n\nVaccination coverage\n\nIn the first 6 months of vaccine distribution, one-month cases per capita in month t correlates positively with vaccine coverage in month t and subsequent months. With the exception of the relationship between one-month cases per capita in May 2021 and people covered by vaccines in August 2021, all remaining months correlated (P < 0.0246). In the first 3 months after vaccine distribution ensued (December 2020–February 2021), people covered by vaccines in month t correlated negatively with infection growth rate in the subsequent t + 3, t + 4, or t + 5 months (P < 0.0461). Starting in March 2021, people covered by vaccines correlates negatively with infection growth rate in respective subsequent months, though the relationship does not reach statistical significance for all months. A delayed negative correlation of people covered by vaccines with fatality rate can be seen. Starting from June 2021, the number of people vaccinated in month t correlated negatively with fatality rate in month t and subsequent months (P < 0.0394) (Supplementary Tables S47–S49).\n\nTo evaluate COVID-19 containment performance impartially, we developed and tested a comprehensive evaluation method that accounts for GP&HE indicators, VH&SE measures, and vaccination. LE captures a nation’s effectiveness in enacting measures according to recent incidence. As variants continue to emerge, a new normal, in which pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions are considered should be established. Because it is unreasonable to expect life to normalize completely in the short term, we did not include the global normalcy index19 in our analyses.\n\nOur sensitivity analysis showed that inclusion of the Google Trends indicator altered the overall rankings of the 50 examined countries and territories slightly. We included it for three reasons: Google Trends data reflect health literacy and impacts on mental health7,8; none of the global institutions assessing COVID-19 containment effectiveness have included public responses in their evaluation criteria; and we believe that public response is important for transmission control.\n\nPrior to vaccine allocation, some countries and territories in Asia and Oceania were more successful at suppressing COVID-19 outbreaks than their European and American counterparts. They exhibited a relative weakening of containment performance after inclusion of the vaccine indicator (since December 2020), likely due, at least in part, to their lower vaccination coverage (Supplementary Information 12, Fig. 4).\n\nNew Zealand and Singapore emerged as the most stable performers. New Zealand has been steadfast in its fight against the vexatious COVID-19, increasing its LE to overcome spikes in infection (March/April 2020) and in fatality (May 2020). Successful containment has contributed to their economic stability during the first phase of pandemic (Supplementary Information 12). After New Zealand was invaded by the Delta variant in August 202120, the number of confirmed cases and infection rates increased, and New Zealand responded with an accelerated vaccination strategy (Supplementary Information 12).\n\nAlthough Singapore did not control rapid viral spread initially, they recovered from outbreaks well. Following a 5-month period of rising cases (April–August 2020), the Singapore government improved its health-system policies and LE, leading to decreased case numbers thereafter. Since January 2021, Singapore has been administering vaccines efficiently, making it a model nation for curbing COVID-19 (Supplementary Information 12). However, the surge in coronavirus infections and confirmed cases in Singapore since September 2021 may be related to Singapore’s “coexisting with COVID-19” strategy and the Delta variant outbreak21,22. Whether Singapore can achieve the goal of ""live with the virus"" has become the focus of global attention.\n\nChanges in containment performance scores of six locations associated with notable performance, activities, or policies are shown in Fig. 1. Denmark and the UK have high vaccination coverage23. Denmark lifted restrictions on September 10, 202124. Starting on July 19, 2021, the UK lifted most of its restrictions and removed social distancing recommendations25. In all US regions, restrictions have eased and people have returned to generally normal life26. The 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games took place in Tokyo, Japan from July 23 to August 8 and from August 24 to September 5 of 2021, respectively27. Vietnam was Asia\'s top-performing economy in 202028. Taiwan has been praised for its 253-day streak without local infections29.\n\nDenmark\'s infection growth increased rapidly from September 2020 to January 2021, though their fatality rate remained low. Transmission was mitigated through strict health-system policies, improved LE, and mass vaccinations. Although the number of confirmed cases increased after May 2021, the fatality rate was low. The pandemic within Denmark appeared to be under stable control, but at the end of the study Denmark faced another new wave of outbreaks, the development of which remains to be seen (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nContainment performance in the UK was not satisfactory in phase one. The UK improved LE and health-system policies while administering vaccinations on a massive scale. These efforts enabled a gradual containment of COVID-19 transmission, which was suppressed by March 2021. There was a case/infection growth surge in June 2021 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nThe USA did not control infection well in the first phase, but its containment performance improved in the second phase. They have endured large numbers of confirmed cases with cascading regional surges (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nJapan adopted inclusive health-system policies. Although their confirmed cases increased during the 2021 Olympics, Japan had several prior waves of increased case numbers, including two in 2021 (January and May). Whether the increase in confirmed cases during the Olympics can be attributed to Olympic event gatherings remains to be clarified (Supplementary Information 12).\n\nVietnam performed well in early but experienced a short-term containment performance decline in August 2020. Vietnam controlled an outbreak that emerged in February 2021 successfully. Infection growth in Vietnam has been relatively high since May 2021, and was only slightly contained until October, but then increased again in November. Transmission in late summer 2021 may reflect Delta variant invasion under low vaccination coverage (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nTaiwan is an exemplary case. COVID-19 transmission was suppressed early owing to a rapid response by Taiwan\'s Central Epidemic Command Center with cooperation from local government agencies and the public30. Taiwan suffered a case surge under low vaccine coverage in May and June 2021. The Central Epidemic Command Center responded with intensive data gathering, expansive testing, quarantines, and stringent non-pharmaceutical policies31. Faced with the highly transmissible Delta variant, Taiwan suppressed case numbers within 2 ~ 3 months (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nWhile countries seek to increase vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness has been tested by the Delta variant and breakthrough infections. In addition to vaccination, non-pharmacological interventions, such as handwashing, masking, and physical distancing, remain important for preventing transmission.\n\nPublic health implications\n\nOur research suggests that the top performing nations tend to enact rigorous health system policies and locally-appropriate lockdown measures, especially early in the pandemic (Supplementary Information 12, and Supplementary Table S11). Asian countries’ border control policies were implemented earlier than non-Asian countries. In Asian and non-Asian countries, the median times to any border closure from the first reported case in China were 24.50 and 67.50 days, respectively (P = 0.0003), and the median times to any border closure from the first domestic case within each country were -10.50 and 8.00 days, respectively (P = 0.0027) (Supplementary Table S50, Supplementary Information 15). Notwithstanding, stringent lockdown measures should not be enacted without careful consideration, and lockdown policies should be adjusted in response to recent incidence. Flexibility in their implementation can yield containment with minimal harm to societies, economies, and mental health.\n\nLimitations\n\nSeveral methodological limitations should be noted. First, we include unemployment rate and GDP loss, but not international aid, economic stimulus packages, or other fiscal measures. Second, Google Trends data do not represent a random sampling and may exclude vulnerable groups without internet access or those not actively searching. Third, ideally, only local infection rates should be considered to obtain precise LE measurements. However, because daily local case data are not fully available, we used incidence data inclusive of imported cases to determine LE scores. Therefore, minor inaccuracies in our LE data are expected (Supplementary Information 5).'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9482299/', 'Headline': 'A cross-country comparison of Covid-19 containment measures and their ...', 'Snippet': 'Actually, around the world, countries are still seeking to limit the impact of Covid-19 on health and society after more than 2 years of fighting SARS-CoV-2.

Specifically, we estimate a cross-country regression for each week, and then calculate the average values of the weekly estimates. The primary benefit of using this model is to correct standard errors for cross-sectional correlations7. The model essentially explores cross-country variations by comparing countries in the same calendar week and allows the coefficients of country-level determinants to vary over time. We present the baseline regression results in Table 2. Specifically, we estimate the following baseline model using Fama and MacBeth’s approach3:\n\n$$Ln\\left( {{1} + Y_{i,t} } \\right) = \\, \\alpha \\, + \\, \\beta X_{i,t} + \\, \\varepsilon_{i,t} ,$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Yi,t represents the number of confirmed cases or deaths in country i in week t. X is the set of explanatory variables defined in “Variable descriptions” section and tabulated in Supplementary Information A.\n\nIn Table 2, the dependent variable in columns (1) and (2) is the number of confirmed cases (Ln(1 + Confirmed)), while the dependent variable in columns (3) and (4) is the number of deaths (Ln(1 + Death)). In contrast to columns (1) and (3), columns (2) and (4) further control for trust government and the number of COVID-19 tests conducted (N_Tests), which are unavailable for eight countries. Specifically, the proportion of people who trust the national government is missing for six countries. The number of cases tested is missing for two countries. As a result, we lose about 8% of the observations with the inclusion of the two extra explanatory variables. In untabulated analyses, we find that the mean variance inflation factor is less than 4.2, suggesting that multicollinearity is not a major issue in our setting8.\n\nBased on the signs of the estimated coefficients, we categorize country-level determinants into two groups: aggravating factors, which have positive signs in the regressions, and mitigating factors, which have negative coefficients in the regressions. We discuss the two groups of factors in “Aggravating factors” and “Mitigating factors” sections, respectively.\n\nAggravating factors\n\nPopulation\n\nTable 2 shows that a country’s population is positively and significantly correlated with total infection cases and deaths. This result is unsurprising because countries with larger populations (e.g., China, the U.S., and India) generally have more infections and deaths reported in a given week. To quantify the effect of the change in population on the number of confirmed cases in column (1), if we increase population by one standard deviation (1.571), the increase in the number of confirmed cases (Confirmed) from its mean value (211,775) is equal to 0.935 × (1 + 211,775) × 1.571 = 311,075, which amounts to 147% of the mean value of confirmed. Because d[Ln(1 + confirmed)]/d(population) = [1/(1 + confirmed)] × [d(confirmed) /d(population)], d(confirmed) = [d[Ln(1 + confirmed)]/d(population)] × (1 + confirmed) × d(Population). Similarly, a one-standard-deviation increase in population is associated with a 162% increase in the number of deaths (Death) from its mean value.\n\nIn Fig. 2, we plot the cumulative number of infections and deaths (with the y-axis on a logarithmic scale) for the three most populous countries (India, China, and the U.S.). These exhibit different trends over time: China reported the largest total coronavirus cases at the beginning of the pandemic, whereas the U.S. (India) reported drastic surges in infections and deaths from March (April) 2020 onwards. Thus, China contributes more to the positive effect of population on COVID morbidity and mortality in the early stages of the pandemic, while other populous countries (e.g., India and the U.S.) drive the population effect in more recent periods.\n\nPopulation density\n\nThe results in Table 2 show that population density has a significantly positive effect on confirmed infections and deaths, suggesting that the Coronavirus causes more infections and spreads faster in more densely populated regions. The effect of population density on COVID-19 outcomes is consistent with Dietz and Heesterbeek6 and Nace5, who document population density as playing an important role in driving how fast a virus spreads. Our finding also supports the physical distancing rule recommended by the World Health Organization, which requires people to keep a distance of at least 1 m from one another and avoid spending time in crowded places or in groups (https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/information/physical-distancing). Using the coefficients of population density in columns (2) and (4), we can infer that a one-standard-deviation (i.e., 1.085) increase in population density is associated with an increase of 34.94% (7.05%) in confirmed (death) from its mean value. The coefficient of population density is positive but statistically insignificant in column (3) (t-statistic = 1.4) where the dependent variable is Ln(1 + death). Thus, we discuss the marginal effects of population density using the coefficients in columns (2) and (4), where we include all explanatory variables.\n\nAge\n\nThe positive and significant coefficients of Age indicate that, ceteris paribus, COVID-19 infection and death rates are higher for countries with older populations. These results are consistent with Dowd et al.9, who document for Italy that the chances of infection and death are significantly higher for the elderly than for younger people. Similarly, Boehmer et al.10 and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) document consistent findings using U.S. data. For example, the CDC reports that, relative to the death rate of the control group aged 18–29 years, those of people in the age groups of 75–84 and 85 + years are about 220 times and 630 times higher, respectively (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html). We complement these country-specific studies by showing that Age consistently helps explain the variations in infections and deaths across a large number of countries. Using the coefficients of Age in columns (1) and (3), we can infer that a one-standard-deviation (i.e., 8.854) increase in age is associated with an increase of 43.4% (77.0%) in confirmed (death) from its mean value.\n\nMale\n\nThe positive coefficients of the gender ratio, defined as the number of males per 100 females, suggest that males are more prone to contracting COVID-19 and subsequent death than females. A possible explanation is that males participate more in the labor market, which requires them to interact with other people, thereby increasing their likelihood of contracting the virus. In addition, Bwire11 points out that sex-based immunological differences can also cause higher morbidity and mortality in males; in particular, males have higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE 2) than females, which is the receptor for both the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, differences in gender behavior or lifestyles can also play an important role. For instance, compared with women, men engage in higher levels of smoking and drinking, display less responsible attitudes/behaviors in undertaking preventive measures (e.g., frequent handwashing and wearing face masks), and are more likely to violate coronavirus policies (e.g., stay-at-home orders)12, thereby making themselves more vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\nUrbanization\n\nUrbanization measures the proportion of the total population living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. The ex-ante prediction regarding the effect of Urbanization on COVID-19 outcomes is ambiguous. On the one hand, people living in cities with high population densities are more likely to come into close contact with others. Hence, a higher degree of urbanization may aggravate the spread of COVID-19. On the other hand, rural areas may have less awareness of the pandemic and lack high-quality healthcare facilities, which may result in a higher chance of infection and death. Thus, the net effect of Urbanization on COVID-19 outcomes should be determined by the tension between these two opposing forces, and is best determined empirically. Our results in Table 2 show that Urbanization is significantly and positively correlated with both infected cases and deaths. This finding confirms that the greater levels of economic and social activity in urban areas facilitate congregation and render city dwellers more prone to infection than rural inhabitants. This effect dominates the plausible impact of low awareness of COVID-19 and poor medical facilities in rural areas on the spread of COVID-19. As such, our results are consistent with Rocklöv and Sjödin2, who document that contagious diseases spread more rapidly in cities than in low-density rural settings.\n\nDemocracy\n\nDemocracy measures free and fair elections and the degree of government interventions in a country. A priori, the relation between the level of democracy and a country’s success in combating the coronavirus pandemic is not immediately clear. Theoretically, democracy should boost public health because, in a democratic country, people can vote out a government that fails to improve healthcare quality and safety in favor of one that promises such improvements. In contrast, autocratic governments with poorly performing healthcare systems face no such checks. Further, democratic countries usually adopt broad-based policies and allocate resources more evenly, whereas authoritarian governments may favor certain groups. Consistent with the beneficial role of democracy in public health, Bollyky et al.13 document that the democratic experience of a country positively affects the health of its citizens. Similarly, using data on all epidemics from 1960 to February 2020, an analysis by The Economist shows that, on average, democratic countries experience lower mortality rates for epidemic diseases than their non-democratic counterparts (https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/02/18/diseases-like-covid-19-are-deadlier-in-non-democracies). The analysis further points out that “authoritarian regimes, although able to co-ordinate massive construction projects, may be poorly suited to matters that require the free flow of information and open dialogue between citizens and rulers”. Further, Chang et al.14 suggest that eight of the 10 best-performing countries in the battle against COVID-19, including New Zealand, South Korea, and Scandinavian countries (e.g., Finland, Norway, and Denmark), are democratic.\n\nConversely, democracies’ pandemic-fighting ability may be hampered by their inherent inefficiency and political division. During an interview with the BBC News on December 14, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stated: “[in the U.S.] each state has a considerable degree of independence of doing things the way they want to do … but when you are dealing with pandemic virus that knows no border or boundary between states, when you do things in a different way, it does not lead to an optimal response. Unfortunately, that is what happened.” (https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000qpcc) Cheibub et al.15 find that unlike autocratic countries, democratic countries have been slower to implement lockdown measures, which are often viewed as contrary to liberal rights. As the speed of government responses and interventions is critical for epidemic prevention and control, an authoritarian government may be able to effectively mitigate and contain the pandemic by making decisive decisions and mobilizing all its private and public institutions, as well as its entire population. In addition, democracy inevitably engenders individualism16, which has been shown by Huang et al.17 to aggravate the severity of COVID-19 by reducing the effectiveness of social distancing and mobility restriction policies.\n\nIn summary, recent studies provide contrasting predictions about the relation between democracy and a country’s performance against COVID-19. Thus, it is ultimately an empirical question to assess such relation during this pandemic. Our results in Table 2 are consistent with the view that, ceteris paribus, democratic countries have disadvantages in combating coronavirus relative to autocratic governments. The coefficients on democracy are positive and statistically significant in all regressions, indicating that, on average, more democratic countries experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality than less democratic countries. Using the coefficient in columns (1) and (3), we can infer that a one-standard-deviation (i.e., 1.382) increase in democracy is associated with an increase of 20.73% (24.47%) in confirmed (death) from its mean value.\n\nWe emphasize that our findings are context-specific and by no means serve as evidence of autocracies triumphing over democracies. While democracies have compelling advantages over autocracies in improving a country’s growth, development, human rights, life expectancy, and healthcare systems (e.g.13,18,19,20,21), the ongoing global pandemic may have exposed the weakness of democracies in combating highly contagious viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Instead of ensuring that more voices are heard during the pandemic, perhaps fast, coordinated, and collective actions are required to contain the spread of COVID-19. Having said that, it is immensely challenging for countries and governments to achieve the fine balance between control of the coronavirus outbreak and the effects of such control measures on the economy, income, education, and psychological wellbeing. The long-term and big-picture effects of both COVID-19 and related control measures are still unclear; autocratic countries and their residents may bear costs elsewhere, despite achieving short-term successes in the battle against COVID-19.\n\nCorruption\n\nCorruption measures the level of political corruption within a country’s political system, a factor that reduces government and business operational efficiency. As expected, the coefficients of corruption reveal that political corruption positively correlates with the severity of COVID-19. This finding suggests that political corruption contributes to the inefficiencies of government interventions to control the pandemic. Given the importance of being able to speedily mobilize all available resources to control and combat highly contagious diseases, curbing corruption during the COVID-19 pandemic is perhaps more important than ever.\n\nGDP\n\nConsistent with Feng et al.22, we document a positive relation between a country’s GDP per capita and the severity of COVID-19, suggesting that the pandemic results in more confirmed cases and deaths in developed countries than in developing countries. This result seems counter-intuitive, as one might expect that wealthier nations would have more resources to limit the spread of a pandemic1. However, we observe that many countries with a high GDP per capita (e.g., the U.S., Switzerland, the U.K., and France) also have high levels of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Schellekens and Sourrouille23 document that the coronavirus death toll has been concentrated in high-income countries. There are several potential explanations for these seemingly surprising results.\n\nFirst, higher GDP per capita may imply greater levels of economic activity and international trade, leading to more frequent interactions among people and hence COVID-19 transmissions. Thus, our findings suggest that economic activity could act as a major mechanism through which an epidemic spreads. Second, Abdalla et al.24 find that advancement in healthcare or medicine has no direct relation with disease prevention. Wealthy countries, such as the U.S., may have outperformed other countries in many dimensions of healthcare but have overlooked investments in promoting population health and disease prevention. Third, developed countries are usually more liberal, so their governments may encounter greater resistance from citizens when implementing restrictive measures (e.g., lockdowns). Fourth, developing countries on average have younger populations, and are thereby less vulnerable to coronaviruses than developed countries, all else constant23. Last, inequality in data quality may play a role in driving the differences in reported numbers between developing and developed countries. We discuss this issue in “Discussion and conclusions” section, although Schellekens and Sourrouille23 point out that inequality in data quality is unlikely to be a first-order reason for the observed discrepancies between wealthy and poor countries.\n\nTechnology\n\nOur technology measure focuses on three technology aspects that are highly relevant for infection prevention and control of pandemic-prone acute respiratory diseases: (1) investment in emerging technology, (2) 4G mobile network coverage, and (3) use of the virtual social network. In particular, (1) and (2) are related to technologies that enable advanced monitoring, surveillance, detection, and prevention through control measures such as contact tracing25, while (2) and (3) facilitate information dissemination, allow expeditious and coordinated data access and sharing, and promote collective actions and informed decision-making (e.g.26,27). Despite concerns over inaccurate information circulated on social media sites, Cinelli et al.27 report that the vast majority of information on mainstream social media sites is reliable (around 95% for Reddit, 93% for YouTube, and 89% for Twitter). We use the average value of these three aspects to capture the level of technological innovation.\n\nTable 2 shows that technology is significantly and positively (negatively) related to the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases (deaths). These results are particularly interesting. The positive relation between technology and confirmed cases reflects the fact that technology can facilitate infectious disease control (e.g., population surveillance, identification of infected cases, contact tracing, and evaluation of interventions) and ensure that infected people and their close contacts are identified, traced, isolated, tested, and eventually confirmed26. On the other hand, early and rapid technology-driven identification of COVID-19 cases enables infected people to obtain timely treatment, which prevents severe consequences such as death, implying a negative relation between technology and the number of deaths.\n\nInequality\n\nOur results show that income inequality, which is measured using the Gini coefficient, is significantly and positively correlated with confirmed cases and deaths. As earlier research (e.g.28,29) suggests, the poor, who are typically low-skilled workers, have a higher likelihood of being exposed to infectious diseases because they often need to be physically present at their workplaces (e.g., factories and construction sites) and use public transport. Further, the poor may prioritize daily necessities for living over their health. As such, low-income populations are more exposed to health risks and infectious diseases.\n\nTourism\n\nWe find that tourism, measured by the number of non-resident tourist arrivals, is positively associated with the number of confirmed cases and deaths, indicating that mobility between countries facilitates virus transmissions. This result also highlights the importance of travel restrictions and border controls in limiting the spread of COVID-19 (e.g.30). The time-varying coefficients of tourism in Fig. 3 indicate that the aggravating effect of tourism on COVID-19 severity mainly took place in the first half of 2020. This is consistent with the findings of the Pew Research Center, which reveal that, as of March 31, 2020, 142 countries had complete (64 countries) or partial (78 countries) border closures put in place because of the COVID-19 outbreak (https://www.pewresearch.org/?p=361112).\n\nHappiness\n\nThe coefficients of happiness indicate that the higher the perceived happiness level in a country, the more COVID-19 cases and deaths. Greater happiness is closely correlated with higher income, greater social support from relatives or friends, and greater freedom to make life choices31. Thus, higher levels of happiness may promote social interactions, leading to more infections and deaths. It is also plausible that people in happier countries may be more individualistic32, place a higher value on pleasure and freedom33, and resist restrictions and inconvenient prevention measures, such as wearing masks.\n\nMitigating factors\n\nTemperature\n\nPrior studies (e.g.34,35) document that viral respiratory diseases present seasonal cyclicity, which can be driven by seasonal changes in temperature, sunlight, absolute humidity, vitamin status, and host behavior36. In line with these scientific findings, our results show that temperature negatively correlates with the severity of a coronavirus outbreak, suggesting that high temperatures may hamper the survival and spread of coronaviruses. This result is consistent with findings in recent studies on COVID-1937,38.\n\nNote that the negative effects of temperature on confirmed cases and deaths do not imply that COVID-19 does not severely affect warm countries. Unlike SARS, which occurred during the winter months but disappeared abruptly as temperature increased, COVID-19 has hit several tropical countries hard, including India and Brazil. Thus, our findings only indicate that, all else being equal, average COVID-19 outcomes are less severe in warmer countries. Relatedly, Tushabe39 compares COVID-19 severity between tropical and temperate countries and documents that the average severity (in terms of infections or deaths) in temperate countries was six times as high as that in tropical countries.\n\nEducation\n\nWe find that a country’s education level, measured using the average number of years spent in school, is a significant factor that helps reduce confirmed cases and deaths. Using the coefficient of education in columns (1) and (3), we can infer that a one-standard-deviation (i.e., 2.772) increase in education is associated with a decrease of 14.41% (19.96%) in confirmed (death) from its mean value. This result is consistent with Cutler and Lleras-Muney40, who document a positive and persistent association between education and health, showing that different levels of education result in different thinking and decision-making patterns. In particular, better-educated people trust science more, are better informed, and exhibit higher levels of critical thinking and superior decision-making abilities. Relatedly, Zhong et al.41 conduct a knowledge, attitude, and practices survey after the coronavirus outbreak in China and find that most Chinese residents with relatively high socio-economic status are more informed about the COVID-19 situation and more proactive in prevention practices. Taken together, we believe that greater awareness and cognitive abilities associated with higher educational levels help explain the beneficial role of education in combating pandemics.\n\nReligious diversity\n\nOur measure of religious diversity (fractionalization) considers both the number and size of religions in a country. The results show that religious diversity is inversely associated with the number of infections or deaths. In additional analyses (untabulated), we examine the impact of ethnic and language diversity on the number of confirmed and death cases but find no significant results. Prior studies have documented that religion helps people cope with anxieties and trauma, develop resilience, and obtain social support from religious groups (e.g.42). Further, religion may also help discipline individuals and families, especially in countries where adherence to governments’ restrictive measures is weak.\n\nMore importantly, religious diversity reflects the differences in religious beliefs and practices in a country. Lu and Yang43 show that religious fractionalization is beneficial to self-rated health using survey data from 55 countries. They argue that diverse religious groups facilitate the accumulation of social capital toward one another, which benefits health and personal development. Alesina et al.44 document that religious fractionalization displays positive correlations with several measures of good governance across countries, and the correlation tends to be higher in more tolerant and free societies. Thus, our findings indicate that the coronavirus does not travel well across religious borders, and a tolerant and appreciative view of various religions helps curb the pandemic.\n\nMedia freedom\n\nPrior studies document that the media has external governance functions in detecting corporate fraud45, exposing violations46, and monitoring corporate managers47. Our results reveal that the degree of media freedom is negatively correlated with COVID-19 cases, suggesting that a strong and free news media can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Timely and transparent information is critical for successful pandemic control. As many people live in confinement for months during a pandemic, they become increasingly reliant on various types of media for news and information to understand the COVID-19 crisis, protect themselves, and evaluate governments’ responses and policies. Media freedom can facilitate the dissemination of critical information about COVID-19 and stop the spread of fake news and misinformation so that citizens have more time to respond to COVID-19 and obtain sufficient, trustworthy information to make informed decisions. The media also fulfills the role of checking government policies and combating corruption. As such, freedom of expression and the press, instead of information control, is much needed in pandemics and should be highly valued as a core part of the social infrastructure required to beat COVID-19.\n\nInterestingly, we find that media freedom is positively associated with the number of deaths. A plausible explanation is that countries with a free media are more truthful in counting and reporting COVID-19 deaths48. Using a machine-learning model to estimate the true death toll of the pandemic, The Economist discovers that official death tolls undercount the total number of fatalities in many parts of the world (https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker). To gain reputational benefits and avoid scrutiny and criticism, a government can curtail media freedom, monopolize access to COVID-19 information, and suppress the true scale of deaths. A few countries (e.g., Egypt, Iran, and Hungary) have banned the dissemination of pandemic-related statistics except those released by officials. In its 2021 media freedom index, Reporters Without Borders reveals a “dramatic deterioration in people’s access to information and an increase in obstacles to news coverage,” suggesting that many governments have used the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent journalists from accessing information and to restrict critical reporting (https://theconversation.com/press-freedom-how-governments-are-using-covid-as-an-excuse-to-crack-down-on-the-publics-right-to-know-159298). In contrast, an independent press can help hold governments accountable and mitigate the underreporting of COVID-19 deaths48, implying a positive effect of media freedom on reported death cases, ceteris paribus.\n\nFemale leader\n\nWe find that, other things being equal, countries with women holding the highest political position generally perform better in the coronavirus pandemic than those with male leaders. Specifically, the coefficients of female leader in columns (1) and (3) imply that, on average, female-led countries have a 25.4% (38%) lower number of confirmed cases (deaths) than male-led countries.\n\nThis finding is generally consistent with Coscieme et al.49, who analyze data from 34 developed countries and China and conclude that female leaders lead to better COVID-19 control outcomes. Their study focuses on countries that have high economic, human development, and democracy indexes, with the exception of China, which was included since it was the first country to report COVID-19 cases. Coscieme et al.49 argue that both contingent factors, such as timeliness and decisiveness of intervention policies, and structural factors, such as higher equality and social development, may explain their findings. Conversely, Aldrich and Lotito50 empirically find no evidence that female leaders introduce containment measures and information campaigns earlier.\n\nUsing a much larger sample that contains 99 developed and developing countries, our findings confirm that leadership gender helps explain cross-country performance variations in the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, female leaders have generally acted more quickly and decisively and have demonstrated greater risk aversion toward losses of human life51. In addition, they have consistently taken a broader view to consider the wider impact of coronavirus on society and have been more open to innovative thinking52, thereby managing the COVID-19 crisis better than their male counterparts.\n\nTrust government\n\nWe find that the proportion of people who trust the national government is inversely related to the number of confirmed cases and deaths. Higher levels of trust in the government boost conformance with government regulations. Siegrist and Zingg53 show that confidence in health agencies positively affects people’s willingness to adopt recommended behavior. Trust in public institutions is also vital for governments’ ability to respond rapidly and effectively and secure support during the pandemic. Chang et al.14 argue that trust in government and societal compliance can be more effective than authoritative lockdowns, as evidenced by Japan and South Korea, whose governments did not resort to large-scale lockdowns.\n\nLaw\n\nLaw measures the strength of a country’s legal system and the degree of observance of law and order. Countries that rank highly on this variable have a more law-abiding citizenry. As the vast majority of countries have adopted containment measures at least at certain points during their pandemic control, this variable reflects the degree to which the containment measures and other government interventions have been observed by the citizenry. The strength and impartiality of the legal system should directly drive the effectiveness of government interventions against COVID-19.\n\nSARS\n\nThe negative and significant coefficients of SARS indicate that countries with SARS experience have achieved better performances in combating COVID-19. This finding is consistent with Ru et al.54, who find that countries with SARS experience have responded to the pandemic in a more timely and proactive way. Their findings are supported by Google search data and evidence from containment policies enforced by central governments. Using the imprint theory, they attribute their results to memories that people have of earlier SARS outbreaks and corresponding preparations. We expect that countries/regions hit by similar viruses, especially those with more recent experiences, may be more alert and responsive. For example, South Korea’s experience with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015 has also helped the country cope with COVID-19 outbreaks. In sum, our results imply that countries with a history of epidemics have clear advantages in preparing for new health catastrophes. Interestingly, Fig. 3 shows that countries/regions with SARS experience had more confirmed COVID-19 cases in the first seven weeks (ending on March 11, 2020) of our sample. One possible explanation is that China, as a country with SARS experience and the first country to report COVID-19 cases, reported a sharp increase in confirmed cases during our early sample period.\n\nHospital beds\n\nThe number of hospital beds is an important measure of healthcare infrastructure. Our results show that this is negatively associated with both infections and deaths, confirming that the overall healthcare infrastructure and medical resources in a country are vital for combating pandemics.\n\nN_Tests\n\nThe number of people tested for COVID-19 is not a predetermined country characteristic, but it can be mechanically related to the number of infected cases reported. Thus, we include the number of cases tested as a control variable in columns (2) and (4) of Table 2. The results show that testing for coronavirus is positively related to the number of infections. This result is not surprising as the more tests conducted, the higher the discovery of confirmed cases. In other words, COVID-19 testing helps identify more infected people. In contrast, the number of cases tested is negatively related to the number of deaths, suggesting that more accurate and reliable tests significantly lower COVID-19 mortality by facilitating earlier detection, isolation, and treatment. More importantly, including the number of COVID-19 tests in regressions does not materially affect the coefficients of the predetermined country characteristics discussed above.\n\nAdditional analyses\n\nTo examine the time-varying effects of our cross-sectional country characteristics on the severity of COVID-19 outcomes, we plot the weekly coefficients of each variable over time for confirmed cases (deaths) in Fig. 3a,b. The results show that these weekly coefficients vary over time. Specifically, the coefficients estimated during the early weeks of the pandemic are more volatile and less statistically significant than those in the later weeks. In addition, the coefficient signs are generally persistent across time. Two exceptions are SARS and hospital beds, which appear to aggravate confirmed cases and deaths during the first few weeks of our sample but become mitigating factors after week 8.\n\nTo assess the relative statistical importance of the determinants in our regressions, we perform a Shapley–Owen R2 decomposition analysis and determine the dominance of one determinant over another by comparing their additional R2 contributions across all subset models. Figure 4a,b present the relative R2 contributions of all determinants in the confirmed cases and deaths regression, respectively. The relative R2 contributions are ranked in descending order. The results show that population is the most important determinant of confirmed COVID-19 cases (deaths); specifically, Population explains approximately 34.8% (37.2%) of cross-country variations in confirmed cases (deaths). The top five determinants (population, tourism, SARS, happiness, and technology) combined contribute about 62.5% of the R2 of the confirmed cases regression.\n\nNext, we summarize the marginal effects of a one-standard-deviation change for all determinants. Specifically, we vary each determinant by one standard deviation and compute the percentage change in the number of confirmed cases (deaths) from its mean value using the coefficients reported in Table 2. Figure 5a,b rank the marginal effects of all determinants in descending order based on their absolute values in the morbidity and mortality regressions, respectively. The results show that population, temperature, and age are the three determinants with the strongest marginal effects on the number of confirmed cases and deaths.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00172-6/fulltext', 'Headline': 'Pandemic preparedness and COVID-19: an exploratory analysis of ...', 'Snippet': 'To explore two potential pathways connecting the governance and social factors identified as statistically associated with COVID-19 outcomes in stage 2, we assessed the relationship between these variables—interpersonal trust, government trust, and government corruption—and the most extreme country-specific reduction in mobility observed at ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 5: {'URL': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hsr2.628', 'Headline': 'Socioeconomic status and COVID‐19‐related cases and fatalities in the ...', 'Snippet': ""The death number was zero in 10 countries because zero cannot be transformed to the common logarithm, so we added 0.00001 per inhabitants-day at risk to the mortality rate. ...

From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://eurohealthobservatory.who.int/monitors/hsrm/analyses', 'Headline': 'COVID-19 pandemic Analyses - World Health Organization', 'Snippet': 'The COVID-19 Health Systems Response Monitor (HSRM) contains information on how countries’ health systems responded to the pandemic between 2020 and early 2022.

Introduction\n\nAs of January 1, 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic had already infected 733,303,027 people, causing 6,697,563 deaths globally [1]. Either fatality or mortality has been used to measure the COVID-19 death rate around the world. Fatality is the proportion of people who die among all diagnosed with COVID-19. With underreported infected individuals in some countries due to their limited testing capacities, fatality is likely to be underestimated [2]. Mortality, isolating the effect of testing capacity, serves as a better outcome measure when assessing the effects of countries’ early COVID-19 responses [3,4]. However, mortality, computed based on reported deaths, cannot provide sufficient information on how many years or weeks of life have been lost due to the disease [5]. Years of life lost (YLL) and weeks of life lost (WLL) are two preferable indicators to assess the mortality impact of COVID-19 [6–9].\n\nA large number of studies employed the YLL method to estimate the mortality impact of COVID-19 [5–7], while the WLL method, a relatively new approach, was only used to measure the COVID-19 mortality burden in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States [8,9]. Because of the availability of data, we used early YLL rate in this study, which was measured by the number of years of life lost due to COVID-19 per 100,000 people as of January 6, 2021 [5]. What is striking is that early YLL rates varied sharply from country to country. On the one hand, the YLL rate was under 10 in Ethiopia, Cameroon, China, Burkina Faso, New Zealand, Bolivia, Iraq, Japan, and Chad; and on the other hand, above 1,000 in Peru, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Belgium, the United States, Chile, Slovenia, Ecuador, and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhy were some countries more successful than others in curbing YLL rate in the early stage of the virus? This question is a puzzle that has spawned numerous theories and speculations but no definitive answers. Studies underway around the world are looking into how 1) a delayed public-health response, 2) past epidemic experience, 3) elderly populations, 4) population density, and 5) national income per capita might have affected a wide variation in early mortality impact. Each possible explanation comes with confounding counterevidence. Different from medical research, our study focuses on these five contributors concerning public-health response policy, demographic, and economic factors.\n\n1.1 Pandemic response policy\n\nA delayed public-health response.\n\nPolicy response is a critical factor in explaining the differences in epidemic control across countries [10,11]. Early and quick public-health responses, such as social-distancing and lockdown measures, have clearly been effective [12,13]. It is believed that a delayed public-health response leads to more deaths [14,15]. Countries that locked down early, such as Singapore and New Zealand, have been able to avoid out-of-control contagions [16,17]. Counterintuitively, some countries where the authorities reacted late and the enforcement of lockdowns was uneven appear to have been spared: Cameroon and Bolivia, for instance, had low YLL rates—0.85 and 7.04 per 100,000 population respectively—even though both of these countries reacted late. An ongoing debate is whether countries should respond quickly without sufficient information or to wait until related knowledge about the virus is available [18].\n\nPast epidemic experience.\n\nExperience of handling prior epidemics, no matter success or failure, may improve countries’ policy learning capability in response to the next crisis [19]. Asian countries, such as South Korea, successfully managed the outbreak of coronavirus because they had been affected by earlier epidemics of SARS and MERS [20]. From that experience, they learned lessons, and thus they were quick to adopt different measures, such as widespread testing, proactive tracing of infected people, and treatment of infected people, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak [20]. In Africa, countries with bitter experience of HIV, drug-resistant tuberculosis, and Ebola also reacted quickly [21]. However, countries with more prior epidemic experience are also more vulnerable to subsequent outbreaks. For instance, the United States, which had previous experience with many infectious diseases, such as SARS and MERS, performed poorly in curbing the early YLL rate [6].\n\n1.2 Demographics\n\nProportion of elderly in population.\n\nDemographic factors are regarded as decisive conditions influencing the transmission and control of COVID-19 [22]. Evidence shows that COVID-19 is highly lethal in the elderly (age above 65), especially those with underlying medical conditions [23]. Many countries have escaped a high number of COVID-19 deaths due to their relatively younger populations [24]. Africa—with 42,750 reported COVID-19 deaths as of January 1, 2021, a tiny fraction of its 1.3 billion population—is the world’s youngest continent, with 60 percent of its population being under the age of 25 [25]. By contrast, the national median age in Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, is more than 45 [25]. The mean age of those who died of COVID-19 in Italy was 81 years [26], and most of these patients had at least one comorbidity before being infected [27]. Yet there are notable exceptions to this demographic theory. Japan, with the world’s oldest population, has had a lower number of casualties due to its successful protection of the elderly [28]. Ecuador has been the worst hit country in the Latin American region [29], although it is one of the youngest countries in the world, with only 7.4 percent of its residents aged over 65 years [25].\n\nPopulation density.\n\nPopulation density has been seen as a facilitator of contagion and social pathologies of many forms [30]. The sheer density of the population will be easier suffering from COVID-19 outbreak, because the risks of infections eruption from epicenters may emerge due to higher population mobility and connectivity [31]. Cross-country studies have shown that higher population density would increase the likelihood of inter-community contagion, thus causing more deaths [32,33]. However, having more people in less space does not necessarily equate risk [34]. For instance, Singapore, one of the most densely populated countries in the world, has contained the pandemic well due to its early quick response and health system resilience [35]. In contrast, Peru, with a very low population density (25.4 people per square kilometer), achieved a high YLL rate of 2,319.73. Therefore, population density plays a vital role in the transmission of COVID-19, but this role should be scrutinized under specific socioeconomic contexts [36].\n\n1.3 National wealth\n\nNational income per capita.\n\nNational wealth gap, usually measured by national income per capita, is another determinant that should be taken into account when analyzing the COVID-19 abatement among different countries [36]. It was believed that high-income countries can cope better with the pandemic because of their higher investment in medical infrastructure and financial relief [36]. However, research has demonstrated a positive relationship between economic resources and YLL in the early wave of COVID-19 [37]. For instance, while high-income countries such as the United States, Belgium, and the United Kingdom have much higher national income per capita than low-income countries including Burkina Faso, Chad, and Sierra Leone, the former witnessed one hundred times higher YLL rate than the latter [5]. The debatable relationship between economic disparities and early COVID-19 mortality impact still needs to be explored with the combination of policy and demographic factors.\n\nThese inconsistencies are largely due to the fact that there may be no single reason for some countries being hit and others being missed. The answer is likely to be some combinations of the above factors. Most studies, in particular the ones using quantitative methods, consider different factors to have independent effects on the COVID-19 mortality impact, overlooking the interaction of multiple factors [38,39]. Moreover, these factors may combine in specific ways when inducing mortality impact. This study addresses the following research question: Under what configurations of these five factors have countries encountered high or low YLL rates?\n\nThis paper aims to shed some light on these combined effects by applying a configurational approach using a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method. It has been almost three years since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic—a crisis that has profoundly affected lives and livelihoods. By reflecting on the many challenges and lessons of the past years, organizations, governments, and societies can continue the journey toward normality and emerge stronger on the other side.\n\n2. Methods\n\nThe fsQCA method is based on the principles of set theory, formal logic, and Boolean and fuzzy algebra. It uses a specific terminology: condition is used instead of independent variable, outcome instead of dependent variable, and cases instead of observations, and results are called solutions, pathways, configurations, or recipes [40]. An fsQCA allows us to study which set of conditions is necessary and sufficient to bring about a certain outcome [41]. The assessment of causal complexity in set-theoretic methods is based on three assumptions: 1) conjunctural causation—a condition only has an effect in combination with other conditions; 2) equifinality—multiple, mutually nonexclusive paths lead to the same outcome; and 3) causal asymmetry—the presence of an outcome may have other explanations than its absence (e.g., high versus low YLL rate) [40]. The fsQCA method is also highly appropriate for analyzing small-to-medium N cases [42].\n\nThe interpretation of the results is mainly based on the consistency and coverage values indicated in the solutions. Consistency shows the extent to which the involved solution path is consistent with reality, or, in other words, the extent to which this solution path leads to the outcome. Coverage, by contrast, assesses the degree to which a cause or causal combination accounts for an outcome. Hence, coverage reports the proportion of membership to the outcome explained by the overall solution term, indicating the percentage of the cases covered. The threshold for the consistency ratio is set to no less than 0.75 [41]. In this study, we set the higher consistency threshold at 0.80 and the frequency cutoff at 1 [38,43]. While fsQCA software generates three types of solution formulae (complex, parsimonious, and intermediate), we apply the intermediate solution, which is in-between the complex and most parsimonious solutions in terms of complexity [38]. The intermediate solution is suggested as the main point of reference for interpreting QCA results [41].\n\n2.1 Data collection and measurement\n\nWith data gleaned from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and the study of Pifarré i Arolas et al., we constructed a dataset of 80 countries on the basis of availability of data for a cross-country comparative configurational analysis. Our study comprises YLL rate as the outcome of interest and five explanatory conditions: a delayed public-health response, past epidemic experience, proportion of elderly in population, population density, and national income per capita. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the five conditions and the outcome, and the dataset of 80 countries is provided in S1 Table.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282617.t001\n\nYLL rate was computed as the number of years of life lost due to COVID-19 per 100,000 population as of January 6, 2021, obtained directly from the study of Pifarré i Arolas et al. [5]. With a focus on early COVID-19 mortality impact, this study used January 6, 2021 as the cutoff point to isolate the effects of vaccination rollout [44], the availability of more effective treatments, and the emergence of new virus variants on overall COVID-19 mortality impact.\n\nA delayed public-health response concerned the number of days from January 1, 2020 until a country first implemented any of nine containment and closure policies [45]. Specifically, OxCGRT provides researchers with nine indicators recording information on the enactment of containment and closure policies: school closing, workplace closing, cancel public events, restrictions on gatherings, close public transport, stay at home requirements, restrictions on internal movement, international travel controls, and facial coverings [46].\n\nPast epidemic experience was a binary condition (0 or 1) showing whether a country had experienced one of four recent epidemics: SARS, MERS, Zika, and Ebola [47]. The epidemiological records on the above four pandemics were all collected from the World Health Organization.\n\nProportion of elderly in population was computed as the population aged 65 years and above as a percentage of the total population in a country [48]. Population density was midyear population divided by land area in square kilometers [49]. National income per capita referred to the gross national income, converted to U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the midyear population [50]. All of these three conditions were obtained directly from the World Bank.\n\n2.2 Calibration\n\nIn QCA, cases receive membership scores, ranging from 0 to1, for each condition and outcome, which are all sets. These membership scores are calibrated to reflect the presence of a case in a certain set of conditions or outcomes. Calibration can be either direct or indirect, the latter needing a stronger theoretical basis than the former [38]. Considering the lack of theory and substantive knowledge guiding the key thresholds on the outcome and conditions, this study employed a direct fuzzy-set method to allow conditions and the outcome to display different degrees of membership in sets. The membership scores of cases in each set were generated in the calibration procedure based on the distribution of raw case values [40]. Three anchor points defined a set: full membership (the 95th percentile), full nonmembership (the 5th percentile), and a crossover point (the 50th percentile) [38]. Then, the raw data were transformed into the log-odds metric, with all values ranging from 0 to 1.\n\nTaking early YLL rate as an example, the thresholds of full membership (the 95th percentile), crossover point (the 50th percentile), and full nonmembership (the 5th percentile) were set at 1,428.78, 166.52, and 6.35, respectively. Any raw value above 166.52 was assigned a membership score between 1 and 0.5, whereas any raw value below 166.52 was calibrated to a membership score between 0.5 and 0. Argentina scored 1,172.82 on raw YLL rate, and its fuzzy-set membership score was calibrated as 0.921. Algeria scored 35.14 on raw YLL rate, and its fuzzy-set membership score was calibrated as 0.081. The calibration thresholds are provided in Table 2, and the fuzzy-set membership scores of the 80 countries are provided in S2 Table.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282617.t002\n\n2.3 Data analysis\n\nWe first performed an analysis of necessity to test whether any single condition and its negation was necessary for either a high or low YLL rate. The results in S3 Table show that none of the five conditions (neither in its absence nor in its presence) reached the minimum consistency benchmark of 0.9 for necessity [51], suggesting that no single condition alone can explain high or low YLL rates. This underscores the importance of exploring the combinations of conditions resulting in high and low YLL rates.\n\nWe now turn to the analysis of combinations of the five conditions sufficient for high and low YLL rates. We ran the fuzzy-set algorithm and obtained the truth tables. The truth tables displaying the configurations associated with high and low YLL rates are presented in S4 and S5 Tables. In the truth tables, we find no contradictory or deviant cases. We performed the standard analyses to generate the complex, parsimonious, and intermediate solutions.\n\nIn producing the intermediate solutions, we had to decide how each causal condition should theoretically and empirically contribute to the outcome. Specifically, based on the existing research findings, we expected that the presence of a delayed public-health response and a large proportion of elderly in the population would contribute to a high YLL rate, whereas the absence of a delayed public-health response and a small proportion of elderly in the population would contribute to a low YLL rate. When it comes to past epidemic experience, one would expect that it will lead to a low YLL rate. However, regression analysis suggests the opposite direction (regression results are provided in S6 Table). Therefore, we expected that the presence of past epidemic experience would contribute to a high YLL rate, whereas the absence of past epidemic experience would contribute to a low YLL rate.\n\nWe further discerned the core and peripheral conditions by examining the parsimonious and intermediate solutions together. Core elements indicate a strong causal relationship with the outcome, and peripheral elements indicate a weaker relationship [52]. The conditions that appear in both parsimonious and intermediate solutions are core conditions, whereas conditions that are not included in the parsimonious solutions and only appear in the intermediate solutions are peripheral conditions [52].\n\n3. Results\n\nTables 3 and 4 show the configurations for high and low YLL rates, respectively, where a black circle ● indicates the presence of a core condition; a crossed-out circle ⊗ indicates the absence of a core condition; a black square ■ indicates the presence of a peripheral condition; a crossed-out square ⌧ indicates the absence of a peripheral condition; and a blank space indicates a “don’t care” condition [52]. The “don’t care” situation indicates that the condition does not play a role in a specific configuration.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282617.t003\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282617.t004\n\n3.1 Configurations for high YLL rate\n\nTable 3 shows four configurations of conditions that are sufficient to explain a high YLL rate, representing an overall solution consistency ratio (0.79) and an overall solution coverage ratio (0.63) that accounts for a substantial proportion of the outcome. The fsQCA also estimates the empirical relevance of every solution by calculating raw and unique coverage. The raw coverage describes the amount of the outcome that is explained by a certain alternative solution, while the unique coverage describes the amount of the outcome that is exclusively explained by a certain alternative solution. The overlap across the four pathways is high, as indicated by the low unique coverage. It suggests that the four configurations are not mutually exclusive, an important feature of QCA. Many countries, for example, the United Kingdom, can fit pathways 1 and 4, whereas a few other countries (highlighted in bold in Table 3) are uniquely covered by a particular pathway (e.g., Switzerland in Configuration 1).\n\nConfiguration 1 covers nine countries, representing a combination of high population density and high national income per capita. In Configuration 2, six countries have the combination of the absence of past epidemic experience, a large proportion of elderly in the population, and high population density. In Configuration 3, three countries align with the combination of the presence of past epidemic experience, a small proportion of elderly in the population, and high national income per capita. Configuration 4 covers six countries, representing a combination of three peripheral conditions including a delayed public-health response, the presence of past epidemic experience, and high national income per capita.\n\n3.2 Configurations for low YLL rate\n\nThe analysis of low YLL rate (Table 4) generated four configurations of conditions sufficient for a low YLL rate. In comparison to the analysis of high YLL rate, it yielded similar overall solution consistency (0.80) and coverage ratio (0.67).\n\nConfiguration 5 illustrates a combination of the absence or low level of two core conditions: the absence of the past epidemic and low population density, covering four countries. In Configuration 6, nine countries fall into the combination of the inverse of one peripheral condition (low national income per capita), the opposite of one core condition (a small proportion of elderly in the population), and the presence of one core condition (high population density). Two countries share Configuration 7 composed of three core conditions (a swift public-health response, no past epidemic experience, and high national income per capita). Configuration 8 covering two countries represents a combination of four core or peripheral conditions: a quick public-health response, past epidemic experience, a large proportion of elderly in the population, and low national income per capita.\n\n3.3 Predictive validity testing and robustness analysis\n\nPredictive validity is important because the models with a good fit do not necessarily provide accurate forecasts [53]. Hence, we tested the configurations for predictive validity as a robustness check of the above findings. To assess the predictive validity, we followed the procedure proposed by Pappas & Woodside [54]. First, we randomly divided the total cases into a subsample and a holdout sample. Next, we conducted the same analysis for the subsample as we did in the previous process. After obtaining the results from the subsample (see Table 5), we used the holdout sample to test the predictive validity of each configuration generated from the subsample [54].\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282617.t005\n\nSpecifically, four configurations of the subsample for high and low YLL rates were regarded as four models, and each model was computed as a new condition in the holdout sample. Then, the new condition was used to plot against the outcome using the holdout sample. All plots are presented in S1 File. The plots provided two numbers of “consistency”: the larger number was consistency, while the other was coverage [54]. Neither of these should contradict the consistency and coverage of the corresponding configuration in the subsample [54]. For instance, S7a Fig in S1 File shows the plot of M1 (i.e., the combination of a delayed public-health response, a large proportion of elderly in population, high population density, and high national income per capita) of the subsample using data from the holdout sample. The consistency and coverage of the plot (0.80 and 0.32) resembled that of model 1 (0.96 and 0.42), indicating the good predictive validity of model 1. The other three models also had high predictive validity.\n\nTo test the robustness of our results in Tables 3 and 4, we altered the consistency threshold levels to 0.85 and 0.90 [55]. Tables 6 and 7 below show a comparison of configurations with different cut-offs for high and low YLL rates, respectively. When we used a cut-off at 0.85, only configurations 3, 6 and 7 are affected, reflecting that a small proportion of elderly in population does not play any role in predicting high YLL rate, whereas population density and national income per capita lose their importance in predicting low YLL rate. With a cut-off of 0.90, more configurations are affected. Nevertheless, all of the configurations at the 0.90 cut-off are subsets of those at 0.80, and most changes are seen in two causal conditions—population density and national income per capita—that were assumed to be neither present nor absent when we generated intermediate solution. Overall, additional robustness analyses yielded similar results.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282617.t006\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282617.t007\n\n4. Discussion\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, a great deal of research has been conducted about the factors that contribute to early COVID-19 mortality impact. Most studies have explored the net effects of the individual factors, including policy responses [10–13], demographics [22–24], and economic factors [36,37]. Without paying attention to the interplay of these factors, these studies produced mixed results. To address these inconsistencies, we conducted a cross-country comparative study to examine the contributing factors of YLL rate from a configurational perspective. The configurational findings confirm our premise that YLL rate is the outcome of five factors—a delayed public-health response, past epidemic experience, proportion of elderly in population, population density, and national income per capita—clustering into eight combinations and that none of these factors on its own is either necessary or sufficient to explain either high or low YLL rate.\n\n4.1 Interpretation of configurations\n\nThe countries associated with high early YLL rates cluster into four scenarios. In the first scenario, high-income countries with high population density experienced high YLL rates. Nine typical cases of this scenario are Belgium, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Italy, the Czech Republic, France, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, and Austria. All of these high-income countries are located in Europe and share similar demographic characteristics. A cross-country study concentrating on mortality in Europe during the first wave of COVID-19 confirmed that a 10-fold higher density was associated with 17.3 excess deaths per million habitants [56]. However, the aforementioned nine countries, even with rich economic resources, did not adopt effective policies to address the potential risks arising from the dense population, thus causing high YLL rates.\n\nIn the second scenario, a set of countries without past epidemic experience are faced with the high risks of transmission and deaths of COVID-19 due to their dense and aging populations. Six typical cases are Belgium, the Czech Republic, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Albania, and Slovenia, among which the first four countries also exist in the first scenario. These six countries did not experience mass epidemics in the past yet facing the serious problems of dense and aging populations at the same time. The absence of epidemic experience makes it hard for them to deal with the COVID-19 crisis full of uncertainty, ambiguity, and unpredictability [57]. High levels of the aging population and population density further complicated their fight against COVID-19 [32], resulting in high YLL rates.\n\nIn the third scenario, a set of countries with past epidemic experience, young demographic structure, and relatively abundant economic resources also witnessed high YLL rates. Three typical cases are Chile, Panama, and Argentina. All of these Latin American countries have experienced outbreaks of Zika and have demographic and economic advantages in curbing COVID-19. However, these advantages did not translate into state capacity. Taking Chile as an example, Chile is a high-income country with a relatively small proportion of the elderly, and it has experienced pandemics in recent years. Nevertheless, Chile reached a high YLL rate of 1,291.46.\n\nIn the fourth scenario, a set of countries delayed their response, despite past epidemic experiences and high income levels. Six typical countries are the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden, Greece, Chile, and Argentina. These countries have experienced pandemics such as SARS, MERS, Zika, and Ebola, along with adequate economic resources. However, all of them were hesitant to implement containment and closure policies in the early stage of the epidemic. Existing research has confirmed that richer countries took longer to take restriction measures [58,59]. For instance, the United Kingdom adopted the “herd immunity” strategy in the early phase, which greatly increased the risks of infection and caused a large number of deaths [60]. Similarly, Sweden preferred to adopt a “nudge” response strategy [61], which missed the optimal response time, causing a high YLL rate.\n\nAs regards the countries that saw low early YLL rates, they follow four different scenarios. The countries in the fifth category neither experienced epidemics in the past nor had high population density. Four typical cases in this path are Latvia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kenya. The population density of them is below 100 people per square kilometer [49], reducing the likelihood of transmission and thereby causing lower YLL rates. In the sixth scenario, a set of countries with high population density and low income level escaped high YLL rates due to their young demographic structure. Nine typical cases are Pakistan, El Salvador, Nigeria, Nepal, Malawi, China, Togo, Sierra Leone, and Ethiopia. All of these countries have a small proportion of elderly in their populations [48], which may weaken the high risks of population density.\n\nIn the seventh configuration, despite lacking past epidemic experience, high-income countries including Japan and Croatia responded quickly to curb the early COVID-19 mortality impact. The two countries have benefited from a combination of a quick response and abundant economic resources that compensates for their lack of prior epidemic experience. In the eighth scenario, past epidemic experience makes it easier for Cuba and Romania to take strict public-health control measures in spite of their aging populations and lack of economic resources. Different from the high-income countries in the seventh scenario, Cuba and Romania explored new avenues for countries with limited economic resources to respond to COVID-19, that is, a quick policy response in conjunction with learning from the past epidemic experience.\n\nOverall, our study finds that high-income countries with dense and aging populations and delayed responses tend to have higher YLL rates than low-income countries with lower population density, younger populations, and quicker responses. This echoes the existing studies emphasizing the policy, demographic, and economic factors in explaining the early COVID-19 mortality impact [14,24,37]. This study enriches the existing research by providing a much more nuanced configurative perspective. For instance, high-income countries such as Japan and Croatia have escaped high YLL rates because of their early quick responses, while countries with younger demographic structures such as Chile, Panama, and Argentina have faced difficulties in responding to the pandemic.\n\nThe role of past epidemic experience in the configurations is more complicated than previous studies have found. Extant studies have suggested that the lesson or experience gained from previous epidemics is conducive for a country to fight against COVID-19 [19,20]. However, we find that past epidemic experience does not necessarily lead to better performance in terms of response to COVID-19. The countries in configurations 3 and 4 have experienced epidemics at least once before, but they all performed poorly in reducing early YLL rates. In contrast, the absence of prior epidemic experience working together with other factors contributed to low YLL rates in configurations 5 and 7. Therefore, the role of prior epidemic experience needs to be examined in conjunction with other conditions.\n\n4.2 Policy implications\n\nWe highlight three policy implications derived from our configurational findings. First, a trustworthy and robust government is necessary to fight against COVID-19 [62], and governments should be held accountable for the outcome of COVID-19 [63]. To this end, governments should improve healthcare capacity, coordination capacity, and learning capacity derived from their epidemic experience. A comprehensive and holistic strategy is necessary for each country facing a pandemic like COVID-19. As is known to us all, policy capacity, social and economic profile, and demographic structure vary greatly from country to country. Thus, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for tackling COVID-19 [61], and each country should tailor its policies to its own context.\n\nSecond, previous studies have shown that a delayed policy response will lead to higher mortality impact [14,15], whereas early and quick interventions with closure and containment policies are beneficial to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and averting more deaths [16,17]. Our study goes beyond these findings and indicates that a quick first response always works well regardless of the country’s past epidemic experience and national income levels. For high-income countries, a quick response can concentrate economic resources on combating COVID-19, compensating for their lack of prior epidemic experience. For low-income countries, a speedy response can protect the elderly from risks of infection and death, compensating for their lack of economic resources.\n\nThird, more emphasis should be placed on the elderly. It is well known that the elderly populations are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than younger people [64], and many studies have demonstrated the positive relationship between the proportion of elderly in the population and COVID-19 mortality impact [23,24]. Our research further shows that a large proportion of elderly in the population in conjunction with high population density may undermine the effectiveness of a country’s policy response and result in worse consequences. Therefore, more attention should be paid to protecting the elderly from COVID-19, especially in high-income countries with high population density or past epidemic experience.\n\n4.3 Limitations\n\nThis study has three limitations. First, our sample did not cover all countries due to the availability of data, despite our efforts to construct a relatively large dataset including 80 countries, and this may constrain the generalizability of our findings. Second, through a process of model refinement, we only chose five factors of theoretical and empirical importance because the QCA method has a limitation on handling a large number of conditions under a limited number of cases. As a result, some macro or micro factors were excluded. Third, we used YLL rate rather than WLL rate as the outcome in light of the availability of data and being comparable to previous studies. When data is available, future studies should use WLL to perform a more fine-grained analysis of the mortality impact of COVID-19 [8,9].\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis study offers a configurational lens to unpack the complexity involved in multiple interacting factors that together contribute to early COVID-19 mortality impact. An fsQCA investigation of 80 countries yielded eight combinations of five factors—a delayed public-health response, past epidemic experience, proportion of elderly in population, population density, and national income per capita—leading to either high or low early YLL rates. Some countries have fared better differently, whereas other countries have fared worse differently. Understanding how these factors configurate in various manners resulting in high or low YLL rates can help policy makers calibrate more contextualized and holistic strategies for combating future epidemics.\n\nSupporting information\n\nS1 Table.

Each country and city may have its own unique circumstances that require additional considerations and adaptations [1]. China has a population of 1.41 billion. Due to this huge population base, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a scientific, gradual, and cautious approach. Preparations for the epidemic and changes in the external environment have created conditions for the reopening [2], including the evolvement of the external environment, gradual formation of the COVID-19 immune barrier, the increased awareness of virus prevention, the advancement in COVID-19 treatment, lower virulence of the Omicron variant [3], and the decreased severe COVID-19 rate and mortality rate [4].\n\nExpansion of healthcare capacity\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the reopening policy, mainly in the following aspects: First, to prepare for potential risks of medical resource overloading associated with the reopening, in the past 3 years, the National Health Commission of China has taken measures to expand healthcare capacity and make progress in treating COVID-19. Common fever clinics have been opened and critical care beds have been expanded to alleviate medical overloading. Medical institutions across the country have strengthened their respiratory infectious disease prevention and control capabilities, with increased medical beds and equipment, as well as improved medical rescue abilities. Moreover, China’s medical grading diagnosis and treatment system plays an important role in meeting the needs of patients and effectively operating the primary medical system. Antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been included in medical insurance through fast-approval channels, and maximum efforts are being made to provide drugs to patients in need. The government and health departments at all levels are providing human, financial, and material support to primary medical institutions to help establish an effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment mode.\n\nDuring the reopening period, China focused on enhancing the ability to treat severe COVID-19 cases, improving the efficiency of transferring severe cases, and preventing mild cases from becoming severe. The collective efforts of the public governance system helped to meet medical needs and navigate the peak of infections.\n\nVaccination program\n\nSecond, SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China [5]. With the widespread promotion and the national free vaccination policy, by early November 2022, over 90% of the total population had completed the full course of the new coronavirus vaccine. Research conducted by the National Major Scientific and Technological Infrastructure for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center showed that among infected individuals aged 60 or older who received two to three doses of the inactivated coronavirus vaccine, the rate of severe illness protection reached 90.15% [6]. The rate of severe illness protection for all infected individuals was reported to be 96.02%. Data released by a research team from the University of Hong Kong also supported the efficacy of domestically produced inactivated vaccines in preventing severe illness and death [7].\n\nEpidemic prevention and control mechanism\n\nThird, over the past 3 years, China has improved its epidemic prevention and control mechanism for COVID-19. The “State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism” was established as a multidepartment coordination platform to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. Through this mechanism, many local outbreaks have been successfully controlled, and guidelines have been developed by the National Health Commission and experts in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, medical treatment, and public health policy. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infection” has been updated ten times to provide up-to-date strategies and recommendations.\n\nWeakened viral virulence\n\nLast but not the least, the variant of SARS-CoV‑2 is accompanied by variable characteristics of the clinical picture, with disease severity appearing to be lower with the Omicron variant [8]. Some scientists warned that this does not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed less virulence than previous variants of concern and lung function was less compromised [9]. There is growing evidence to suggest that, with the protection of vaccines and improved treatment conditions, the harm of COVID-19 to the population has significantly decreased over time [10].\n\nThese are just some of the prerequisites for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus is highly contagious, and the short-term surge in confirmed cases is an undoubtful challenge faced by medical institutions after the reopening. The 3‑year period of hard and effective epidemic prevention and control in China has won valuable time and experience for the comprehensive opening up of the country. It seems that the threat of the virus to the population has become more manageable; thus, ending the dynamic zero-COVID policy and reopening the country supports economic recovery and international cooperation. In 2022, Omicron became the dominant strain in China, with a weakened pathogenicity resulting in mostly mild symptoms and a small proportion of severe cases. With high vaccination rates and effective epidemic control measures, the focus shifted from “dynamic clearance” to “protecting vulnerable populations.” On January 7, 2023, the State Council issued the 10th edition of the prevention and control plan, which emphasized vaccination and personal protection, optimized testing strategies, and outlined emergency measures during the epidemic.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-Covid', 'Headline': 'Zero-COVID - Wikipedia', 'Snippet': 'Zero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic. [ 1 ] [ a ] In contrast to the "" living with COVID-19 "" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression ...', 'Full_text': 'COVID-19 elimination strategy\n\n""Zero-COVID policy"" redirects here. For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}}",100.0,3

For 2023, income below $3,500 (below $10,538 for joint filers) is tax-exempt. Here’s how much you’ll pay if you make more money this year.', 'Full_text': ""You can’t escape federal income tax on your unemployment benefits. But you may be wondering if unemployment is taxable at the state level. The answer to that depends on where you live. That’s because some states consider these benefits taxable income, while others don’t.\n\nWhere is unemployment taxable?\n\nBefore turning to states that tax unemployment benefits, it’s important to know that unemployment benefits are taxable at the federal level. The IRS considers unemployment benefits taxable income, and you must claim the benefits as such when you file your federal income tax return.\n\nNote: You can opt to have a portion of federal taxes withheld from your state unemployment benefit payments. However, you request this since withholding is not automatic for unemployment benefits. You will receive a Form 1099-G containing information showing the total amount of your benefit payments and withholding for a given year.\n\nWhich states don’t tax unemployment benefits? Unemployment benefits are taxable to some degree in most states. But you won’t have to pay state income tax on these benefits if you live in one of the states listed below.\n\nThese states either don’t impose tax on personal income or exempt unemployment income from tax.\n\nAlabama\n\nAlaska\n\nCalifornia\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nFlorida\n\nMontana\n\nNevada\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nVirginia\n\nWashington\n\nWyoming\n\nIf you collect unemployment in any other state, you may find yourself with a bigger-than-expected tax bill when you file your state return. Here’s how the states that do tax unemployment will tax your benefits in 2023.\n\nArizona taxes on unemployment\n\nArizona taxes unemployment benefits at the same rate regular income is taxed. However, there’s a good chance you’ll pay less income tax in Arizona this year since the state now imposes a flat 2.5% tax rate, regardless of how much you earn (or collect in unemployment).\n\nThe previous income tax rate in Arizona was 2.98%.\n\nThe reduced tax rate went into effect one year earlier than planned.\n\nArkansas state unemployment tax\n\nArkansas considers your unemployment benefits taxable income, but the state doesn’t have a flat income tax rate like Arizona does. That means how much tax you pay depends on which tax bracket you fall into.\n\nThe tax rate is 2% for taxable income between $5,100 to $10,299.\n\nIf your taxable income is more than $24,300, you’ll pay a 4.7% tax rate.\n\nTaxpayers with net incomes over $84,500 may reach higher tax rates sooner than the brackets noted above.\n\nColorado taxes on unemployment\n\nColorado will tax your unemployment as regular income, but there’s no need to worry about which tax bracket you fall into. You’ll pay a flat 4.4% Colorado state income tax rate in 2023, regardless of your income level.\n\nDelaware unemployment tax\n\nDelaware will tax your unemployment benefits, but how much will you pay? That depends on your yearly income. You’re subject to a Delaware income tax rate of at least 2% if your taxable income is above $2,000. But you could owe the state more.\n\nIf your taxable income is between $5,001 and $60,000, you could pay a tax rate up to 5.55%.\n\nDelaware taxes income greater than $60,000 at a 6.6% rate.\n\nGeorgia unemployment tax\n\nUnemployment benefits are taxable in Georgia, and most filers will pay a 5.75% state income tax rate. That’s because this rate applies to filers with more than $7,000 of income ($10,000 for joint filers).\n\nGeorgia will move to a 5.49% flat tax rate in 2024.\n\nGeorgia may reduce the tax rate to 4.99% by 2029, but that will only happen if specified targets are met.\n\nHawaii unemployment tax\n\nYou can’t escape state taxes in Hawaii. The state taxes unemployment benefits to the same extent as the federal government. There are 12 income tax brackets in Hawaii. The lowest bracket comes with a 1.4% tax rate, but most Hawaii residents will pay more.\n\nIncome tax rates in Hawaii range from 7.6% to 10% for single filers with income between $24,001 and $200,000.\n\nIf your taxable income exceeds $200,000 ($400,000 for joint filers), you’re subject to an 11% tax rate.\n\nIdaho income tax\n\nIdaho is another state that taxes unemployment benefits, and you’ll pay the same tax rate, regardless of your income. That’s because Idaho moved to a flat income tax rate of 5.8% for all taxable income over $2,500 ($5,000 for joint filers) in 2023. That’s good news if you’re a high-earner, but the flat tax rate means people with lower incomes may pay more than they would in other states.\n\nIllinois unemployment tax\n\nUnemployment benefits are taxed in Illinois, and it is another state with a flat tax rate. However, taxpayers in Illinois pay nearly one percent less than Idaho residents. Illinois’ flat tax rate of 4.95% creates a lower tax burden for people with higher incomes, but taxpayers with lower incomes may pay more tax in Illinois than in other states.\n\nIndiana unemployment taxes\n\nIndiana taxes unemployment benefits, but residents are luckier than some. Indiana imposes a flat tax rate of 3.15%, which is much lower than in many states. That rate is also lower than Indiana's tax rate last year.\n\nIn 2022, Indiana imposed a flat tax rate of 3.23%.\n\nIndiana residents may be able to deduct a portion of unemployment benefits from their taxable income.\n\nIowa taxes on unemployment income\n\nUnemployment income is fully taxable in Iowa, so be prepared for a possible tax bill when you file your state tax return. Even if your taxable income is low, you could be taxed at a 4.4% tax rate, which is high considering how low tax brackets are taxed in most states.\n\nIowa taxes income up to $6,000 ($12,000 for joint filers) at a 4.4% tax rate.\n\nIncome tax rates in Iowa max out at 6% (on more than $75,000 of taxable income for single filers and more than $150,000 of taxable income for joint filers).\n\nThe state will move to a 3.9% flat rate in 2026.\n\nIs unemployment taxable in Kansas?\n\nUnemployment benefits are subject to Kansas state income tax, but how much will you pay? That depends on how much money you make in 2023. However, tax brackets in the state max out at 5.7%, which is low compared to many states.\n\nThe low tax bracket of 3.1% applies to single filers with income under $15,000 ($30,000 for joint filers).\n\nTaxpayers with income over $30,000 in income ($60,000 for joint filers) are subject to the 5.7% tax rate.\n\nKentucky tax on unemployment benefits\n\nKentucky taxes unemployment benefits to the same extent as federal law, but you won’t have to guess your state tax rate. That’s because Kentucky imposes a flat income tax rate of 4.5% for 2023. This tax rate could be reduced to 4%, but there are no guarantees.\n\nLouisiana tax on unemployment\n\nIn Louisiana, you’ll pay between 1.85% and 4.25% on your unemployment benefits. That’s because the Pelican State taxes unemployment to the same extent as the federal government. So, what state tax rate will you pay? It depends on your total yearly income.\n\nYou will pay a 1.85% tax rate with income up to $12,500 (up to $25,000 for joint filers).\n\nIf your income range is between $12,501 and $50,000 ($25,001 to $100,000 for joint filers), you are subject to a 3.5% tax rate.\n\nFilers with income over $50,000 ($100,000 for joint filers) will pay a 4.25% tax rate.\n\nMaine unemployment tax\n\nMaine taxes unemployment benefits, and income tax rates are higher for many filers in Maine than in other states. That’s because the lowest tax bracket in Maine is 5.8%. That’s higher than the highest tax rate in some states.\n\nThe tax rate jumps to 6.75% for income over $24,500 (over $49,050 for joint filers).\n\nThe highest tax rate is 7.15% in Maine and applies to income over $58,050 (over $116,100 for joint filers).\n\nIs unemployment income taxed in Maryland?\n\nThe good news is Maryland’s income tax rates max out at 5.75%. The bad news is the state taxes income under just $1,000 at 2%, including unemployment benefits. How much Maryland income tax will you pay?\n\nEven taxpayers with income up to $3,000 are subject to a 4% tax rate.\n\nTaxpayers with income up to $100,000 ($150,000 for joint filers) fall into the 4.75% tax bracket.\n\nIf your income exceeds $250,000 ($300,000 for joint filers) your tax rate is 5.75%.\n\nMassachusetts taxes on unemployment\n\nMassachusetts taxes unemployment benefits, but the state will tax you a flat 5% income tax rate unless you made over $1 million in 2023. In that case, you must pay the Massachusetts millionaire’s tax, which went into effect this year.\n\nThe millionaire tax in Massachusetts is an additional 4% on income over $1 million.\n\nRevenue from the tax helps to fund school lunches for Massachusetts students.\n\nMichigan taxes on unemployment\n\nUnemployment income is taxable in Michigan, but figuring out how much state tax you owe is easier in Michigan than it is in most other states. That’s because the Wolverine State imposes a flat income tax rate.\n\nFor 2023, Michigan’s flat income tax rate is 4.05%.\n\nKeep in mind that municipalities in Michigan may tax other income, such as wages.\n\nTax rate for unemployment in Minnesota\n\nMinnesota taxes unemployment benefits, and to make matters worse, the state imposes higher income tax rates than most. The lowest state tax rate is 5.35% and applies to income up to $30,070 ($43,950 for joint filers). If your income is higher, you will pay even more.\n\nIf your income falls between $30,070 and $98,760 ($43,951 to $174,610 for joint filers), your Minnesota income tax rate is 6.8%.\n\nThe state tax rate climbs to 7.85% for incomes between $98,761 to $183,340 ($174,611 to $304,970 for joint filers).\n\nYour income tax rate in Minnesota is 9.85% if your taxable income is higher than the amounts listed above.\n\nMississippi state unemployment tax\n\nMississippi taxes your unemployment benefits at a flat 5% income tax rate, but there is good news for residents in the future. The 5% tax rate is set to reduce over the next few years, thanks to recent legislation passed by lawmakers. Here’s what Mississippians will pay — and when:\n\n4.7% in 2024\n\n4.4% in 2025\n\n4.0% in 2026\n\nMissouri unemployment tax\n\nIn Missouri, your unemployment benefits are considered taxable income. However, many state residents will pay less income tax this year. That’s because Missouri’s top tax bracket was recently reduced from 5.3% to 4.95%.\n\nMissouri residents with taxable income above $8,968 are subject to the 4.95% tax rate.\n\nHowever, the first $1,000 of income is tax-exempt.\n\nNebraska state unemployment tax\n\nNebraska is another state that taxes unemployment benefits, and many taxpayers fall into the state’s top income tax bracket. That’s because the highest bracket applies to taxable income over $35,730 (more than $52,980 for joint filers). The rate for the top tax bracket is set to gradually reduce over the next few years though. Here’s what Nebraskans who fall into this bracket will pay in the coming years.\n\n6.44% in 2024\n\n6.24% in 2025\n\n6% in 2026\n\n5.84% in 2027\n\nNew Mexico unemployment tax rate\n\nNew Mexico income taxes on unemployment benefits range from 1.7% to 5.9% Single filers making $16,000 or are subject to a tax rate up to 4.7%. Joint filers can make up to $24,000 without surpassing the 4.7% rate. Higher earners pay even more taxes in New Mexico.\n\nNew Mexico’s income tax rate is 4.9% for incomes between $16,001 to $210,000 ($24,001 to $315,000 for joint filers).\n\nAll New Mexicans with taxable incomes higher than the amounts above are subject to the state’s highest tax rate of 5.9%.\n\nNew York state unemployment tax\n\nYou can’t escape paying income tax on unemployment benefits in New York. The Empire State considers your unemployment payments taxable income, and the state has nine income brackets. That means how much state taxes you pay can vary greatly, depending on your annual taxable income.\n\nIncome tax rates start at 4% in New York and apply to taxable income up to $8,500 ($17,150 for joint filers).\n\nHowever, the highest tax rate of 10.9% only applies if your income exceeds $25,000,000, so most New Yorkers pay a tax rate somewhere between the two.\n\nNorth Carolina unemployment tax\n\nThere’s some good news and some bad news when it comes to Norththe Carolina unemployment tax. The state currently taxes these benefits at a flat tax rate of 4.75%. That is high for taxpayers with lower incomes but low for the highest-earning residents (compared to other states).\n\nNorth Carolina’s flat income tax rate is set to gradually reduce over the next four years.\n\nIn 2027, the flat tax rate will be 3.99%.\n\nNorth Dakota unemployment tax\n\nNorth Dakota taxes unemployment benefits, but many residents won’t pay a dime to the state this year. That’s because recently enacted legislation exempts income up to $41,775 for single filers. Other taxpayers catch a break, too.\n\nJoint filers with incomes below $69,700 are also exempt from paying North Dakota state taxes.\n\nTaxpayers with higher incomes only pay a 2.5% income tax rate. That’s much lower than most other states in the country.\n\nOhio unemployment tax rate\n\nOhio considers unemployment benefits taxable income, but the state imposes lower tax rates than many other states. For example, top earners in Ohio pay a 3.75% state income tax rate. This was recently reduced from the highest 2022 rate of 3.99%.\n\nIn 2024, the 3.75% (for incomes over $115,000) tax bracket will be eliminated.\n\nThe highest tax bracket will be taxed at 3.688% in 2024 and will apply to taxable income over $100,000.\n\nAre Oklahoma unemployment benefits taxed?\n\nOklahoma taxes unemployment benefits, and most residents will pay the top income tax rate of 4.75%. That’s because this tax rate applies to taxable income over $7,200 ($12,200 for joint filers). If your taxable income is below this amount, here’s you much Oklahoma income tax you might pay.\n\n0 .25% on up to $1,000 ($2,000 for joint filers)\n\n1.75% on income from $2,500 to $3,750 ($5,000 to $7,500 for joint filers)\n\n2.75% on income from $3,750 to $4,900 ($7,500 to $9,800 for joint filers)\n\nOregon unemployment tax\n\nOregon taxes unemployment benefits. And to make matters worse, the state has higher income tax rates than most. Depending on your annual taxable income, you can expect to pay an Oregon tax rate between 4.75% and 9.%.\n\nOregon residents with income up to $4,500 ($8,100 for joint filers) will pay the low 4.75% tax rate.\n\nThe highest income tax rate of 9.9% applies to taxable income over $125,000 ($250,000 for joint filers).\n\nRhode Island unemployment taxes\n\nUnemployment benefits are considered taxable income in Rhode Island, and you may wind up paying a 3.75% state income tax rate, even if you made very little. The lowest tax bracket of 3.75% applies to taxable income below $73,450.\n\nYou could pay a 4.75% tax rate if your taxable income is between $73,450 and $166,950.\n\nThe Oregon income tax rate for taxable income over $166,950 is 5.99%.\n\nSouth Carolina unemployment tax\n\nSouth Carolina taxes unemployment income and most state residents are subject to the highest income tax bracket of 6.5%. That’s because this tax rate applies to taxable income over $16,040. Here’s how much you might pay in South Carolina income tax if your income falls below this threshold:\n\nIncome up to $3,200 is tax-exempt.\n\nSouth Carolina’s income tax rate is 3% for taxable income from $3,200 to $16,040.\n\nUtah unemployment tax\n\nIf you collect unemployment benefits in Utah this year, you’ll pay state income tax on the payments you receive. However, you won’t have to figure out which tax bracket you fall into. Utah has a flat income tax bracket of 4.65%. That means you’ll pay a 4.65% tax rate whether you make $20,000 or $200,000 in 2023.\n\nVermont state unemployment tax\n\nVermont taxes unemployment as taxable income, but it’s possible to escape Vermont’s state income tax if your income falls below specified thresholds set by the state. For 2023, income below $3,500 (below $10,538 for joint filers) is tax-exempt. Here’s how much you’ll pay if you make more money this year.\n\n6.6% on taxable income from $48,900 to $113,550 ($86,388 to $193,938 for joint filers)\n\n7.6% on taxable income from $113,550 to $233,050 ($193,938 to $289,988 for joint filers)\n\nFilers will pay the highest Vermont income tax rate of 8.75% if they make more than the amounts listed above.\n\nUnemployment tax in West Virginia\n\nWest Virginia taxes unemployment income to the same extent it’s taxed by federal law. However, West Virginia income tax rates max out at 5.12%, which is lower than the highest tax brackets in many states. The 5.12% tax bracket applies to taxable income over $60,000.\n\nThe lowest West Virginia tax rate of 2.36% applies to income up to $10,000.\n\nTaxpayers with incomes that fall between $10,000 and $60,000 pay a tax rate between 3.54% and 4.72%.\n\n(Note: The income thresholds for married filing separately taxpayers are lower.)\n\nIs unemployment taxable in Wisconsin?\n\nUnemployment is taxable in Wisconsin. However, some residents can exclude a portion of their payments from taxable income for state tax purposes. To find out if you can exclude any of your unemployment benefits, complete Wisconsin Schedule SB. Wisconsin has three income tax brackets.\n\n3.54% on up to $12,760 (up to $17,010 for joint filers)\n\n5.3% for taxable income from $25,521 to $280,950 ($34,031 to $374,600 for joint filers)\n\n7.65% for income amounts above the thresholds listed above""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/FAFSA/comments/u0u9p9/did_you_or_your_parents_receive_unemployment_in/', 'Headline': 'Did you (or your parents) receive unemployment in 2020?

Tax filers who received unemployment benefits in 2020 and filed taxes prior to March 11, 2021, will have an inflated and incorrect Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) on their original tax record compared to those who filed or amended after the passing of the ARP.\n\nFollow me here: your AGI decides your EFC (expected family contribution, sometimes called an SAI or student aid index) which then decides your entire student aid eligibility, including Pell grant.\n\nAn AGI inflated by $10,000 can change your 2022-2023 EFC/SAI by $3,000 to $5,000 per person in your household. This difference can and will make students who are fully and completely eligible for Pell Grant, etc., appear ineligible.\n\nThis is very bad!\n\nIs there a quick fix? No. The only solution would be for the IRS to fix everyone\'s AGI, but that is a tremendous amount of work, and because they don\'t have to, they wont. Yay! The government!\n\nCan the Department of Education or Student Aid do anything about it? Nope, because there are simply too many variables in deciding someone\'s AGI. Even the most basic of changes to the FAFSA application take multiple years, so simply adding a question about unemployment is not an option.\n\nNeither me nor my parents (if dependent) received unemployment. Does this effect us? Nope! You\'re good! Seriously, do not worry about this if you did not receive unemployment.\n\nOkay, I am freaking out. What can students or parents do?

The AGI on your Account Transcript will be correct. If you are a dependent student, you may have to get your parents to do this. Sorry!\n\nI filed before March 11th 2021, and I have not filed my 2022/2023 FAFSA yet. Is there anything I can do? Yes! Because this situation is very muddy, I personally recommend not using the Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) built in to the FAFSA application, and instead requesting a copy of your Record of Account Transcript and Tax Account Transcript, which will be correct, and use this information to file your FAFSA. Not using the DRT often makes you more likely to be flagged for verification, so be prepared to submit copies of your tax information, etc.\n\nIs this an actual nightmare? Yes, for everyone involved. Even if only 20,000 students are effected (.1% of FAFSA filers), that is too many students not receiving the vital aid they are eligible for. As a FA professional, I find this unconscionable.\n\nWhat have Financial Aid Advisors been told about this? Next to nothing. Memos have been sent by Student Aid, the occasional blog has written about it, and NASFAA has shared information, but most people who administer financial aid do not know about this. Industry wide, nobody in a position of leadership or oversight really wants to touch it because it is such a stupid, convoluted, annoying, bureaucratic nightmare problem.

Yet, on average, UI benefits only replace roughly 40 percent of a worker’s pre-layoff wages. This amount is insufficient to afford basic necessities, particularly for underpaid workers and workers of color who, due to systemic racism, have been segregated into underpaying occupations and have less savings and support to draw from. Underpaid parents and family caregivers are particularly harmed as they generally need to use their full salary to make ends meet. Households with children are much more likely to face housing insecurity when a job is lost.[1] And nondiscretionary expenses, such as childcare, diapers, groceries, and medical prescriptions, are higher for workers caring for dependents. Women of color disproportionately feel the impact of low UI benefit amounts, as they are overrepresented in underpaid jobs and make up a disproportionate share of single-parent households. As a targeted solution, dependent allowances can increase equity and ensure that workers—particularly single mothers of color—can support themselves and their families when they are between jobs.\n\nA dependent allowance provides parents and other caregivers with additional weekly benefits on top of their regular UI based on the number of dependents they claim. As of 2021, there were 13 states with dependent allowances: Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. However, there is significant variation among the states in how they define a “dependent” and how they calculate the weekly amount workers receive. In fact, in many states dependent allowances are almost meaningless—certain state legislatures have severely restricted who is considered a dependent, how many dependents a worker can claim, and the amount workers can receive for each dependent.\n\nDefining dependents\n\nCurrent state laws providing for dependent allowances are tailored to meet the needs of the traditional “nuclear family” model and do not recognize the full breadth of caregiving and familial relationships workers experience. Every state with a dependent allowance makes the benefit available to unemployed workers with a child under the age of 18. However, there is some variation in who is considered a child.\n\nAll states except Massachusetts consider a stepchild a dependent, but only 10 states also include adopted children. A couple of states—Iowa and Michigan—use more inclusive definitions of “dependent,” but they only apply under certain circumstances. In Michigan, a parent over the age of 65 or who is permanently disabled from work may be considered a dependent. Similarly, unemployed workers can claim a sibling as a dependent in Michigan, but the sibling must be under 18, orphaned, or have living parents who are also claimed as dependents by the same worker. Similarly, Iowa adopts a more expansive definition, allowing siblings, parents, cousins, and individuals who have lived in their home as a member of their household for a whole year.[2] The state allows spouses to receive a dependent allowance, provided they do not earn more than $120 in gross wages in one week. States will not only look at the familial relationship, but also consider whether the person receives enough financial support to be considered a dependent. Generally, states will require that the person receives at least half of their financial support from the worker to be considered their dependent.\n\nExclusive definitions of “dependent” can disproportionately impact immigrant workers who are more likely to live in multigenerational households and provide care for multiple family members other than, or in addition to, minor children.[3]\n\nCalculating the amount of the dependent allowance\n\nThere is great variety and disparity in how states calculate the amount workers receive as a dependent allowance. Generally, states set a weekly allowance per dependent, either as a fixed sum or as a percentage of their weekly benefit amount (WBA). Massachusetts and New Mexico both offer weekly allowances of $25 per dependent while New Jersey offers 7 percent of a worker’s WBA for their first dependent and 4 percent for each of the next two dependents.\n\nAll states have additional restrictions, such as limiting the amount or type (e.g., child or spouse) of dependents a worker can claim and capping the total amount a worker can receive when the dependent allowance is added to their regular UI benefits. Some states also restrict dependent allowances based on minimum and maximum WBA. These formulas can be especially harmful in states with a low maximum benefit and for underpaid workers receiving the minimum WBA. For example, Ohio offers a sliding scale of $1–$155 in weekly allowance per dependent, with the most low-paid workers can receive being capped at $0, effectively barring them from receiving it, but higher-paid workers can receive up to $155 total per week.\n\nDue to these restrictions, many workers never receive the full amount. These overly restrictive limits dilute the benefit of dependent allowances.\n\nPotential Impact on employers’ experience rating\n\nAs discussed more in depth in our financing and solvency brief, the UI system is “experience rated,” which means that employers are taxed at different rates based on their “experience” with unemployment. Or, in other words, based on the UI benefits paid out to their former employees. This means that generally employers will also be charged for any dependent allowance. However, states can choose to not charge employers for the dependent allowance amount.[4] For example, both Connecticut and New Mexico do not charge employers for the dependent allowance amount. The current health of the state’s trust fund will be a factor in determining whether to charge or not charge employers for the dependent allowance.\n\nFederal Requirements and Guidance\n\nThere are no federal laws related to dependent allowances. States have broad flexibility to decide the benefit amount, who is considered a dependent, and under what conditions workers are eligible for the additional benefit.\n\nIf a state implements a dependent allowance, the additional amount is considered part of a worker’s benefit amount and is subject to the same due process requirements as regular UI benefits. This means states must also provide proper notice and appeal rights.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\n\nDependent allowances offer a targeted way for states to improve equity within the UI system and ensure UI benefits meet the needs of working parents and family caregivers. Yet, few states provide dependent allowances and states with dependent allowances tend to have overly complicated processes and restrictive standards. Below are key policy reforms that can either improve current laws or provide a template for states seeking to enact a dependent allowance. Our suggestions fall into three categories: broad and inclusive dependent definitions, adequate and progressive funding calculations, and improved data collection and reporting. States should:\n\nBroaden and expand dependent definitions. Workers should be able to receive a dependent allowance for all the people they care for and who depend on their income to survive. States should establish simple processes for determining dependents. This would ensure workers can easily understand what they are entitled to and ease administrative burdens for state agencies.\n\nMichigan offers one of the best examples of coverage among the states with dependent allowances. In addition to an expansive definition of dependent children, the state allows spouses, parents over 65 or permanently disabled from gainful employment, siblings (orphaned or whose living parents are dependents, either under 18 or full-time student under the age of 22), and a maximum number of five dependents. However, the state’s benefit amount is too low at just $6 per dependent per week. The following are recommendations for who should be considered dependents when they receive at least half of their financial support[5] from the worker:\n\nNot only biological children but also adoptive, foster, stepchildren, and any other child the worker stands in loco parentis[6]\n\nMinor children (under 18) and those over 18 who are attending full-time school (up to the age of 26).\n\nA person who is 60 years of age or older.\n\nA person over 18 with a physical or mental disability that requires care.\n\nA spouse or domestic partner.\n\nEstablish an adequate and equitable dependent allowance amount. Dependent allowances should reflect parents’ and other caregivers’ real dependent obligations and enable them to meet their financial needs. Thus, there should not be a cap on the number of eligible dependents.\n\nOf the states with dependent allowances, Massachusetts and Illinois offer more generous amounts overall. Massachusetts offers $25 per dependent with a cap of half of the worker’s WBA.[7] Illinois uses a sliding scale of $26–$178, with $26 the maximum dependent allowance for minimum WBAs and $178 the maximum dependent allowance for maximum WBAs.[8]\n\nBelow we provide three options for the dependent allowance amount and its calculation.\n\nOption 1: Flat-rate dollar amount increases annually based on consumer price index. Under this option, the unemployed worker would receive a dependent allowance of a flat dollar amount per dependent—we recommend at least $50. The amount would be increased annually to represent the percent change in the consumer price index published in the preceding year.\n\nOption 2: Percent of the state’s annual average weekly wage. Another option for states is to provide a dependent allowance for each dependent based on a percentage of the state’s average weekly wage. We recommend using a percentage of your state’s average weekly wage that would equate to at least $50 (based on 2021 average weekly wages, this is likely around 4 percent, but should be customized based on your own state’s average weekly wage).\n\nOption 3: Percent of the state’s annual average WBA. Unemployed workers could receive a dependent allowance based on a percentage of the state’s average weekly benefit amount for each dependent. We recommend a percentage of the average weekly benefit amount that would equate to at least $50 (based on 2021 average weekly benefit amounts, this is likely around 25 percent, but should be customized based on your own state’s average weekly benefit amounts).\n\nImprove data collection and reporting. More publicly available data on dependent allowances is crucial for measuring program success and ensuring it meets workers’ needs. States should be collecting and reporting data on the current and total number of workers utilizing a dependent allowance, the average dependent allowance amount, the average number of dependents that workers claim, and the amount and reason for any challenge to a dependent allowance, the basis for the challenge, and outcome of the challenge. This data should be disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and income levels.\n\nUse NELP’s dependent allowance model state legislation to help draft a bill to implement many of these policy recommendations. Please note that the process of drafting legislation can vary depending on state-specific legal and policy issues. For example, existing state UI law may use certain terms or phrases that the model language would not reflect. Similarly, different states’ laws may not include all sections in the model state legislation.\n\nResearch Findings and Arguments to Support Reform\n\nDependent allowances support economic growth.\n\nWhile there is limited data available on the impacts of dependent allowances, studies have shown that UI—especially in states that provide livable benefit amounts—leads to faster economic recovery by supporting local and state economies. For example, after the Great Recession, economists found that every $1 of unemployment generated $1.61 for state and local economies;[9] adjusting for inflation, this impact is higher today.\n\nBecause UI benefits only replace a portion of lost wages, dependent allowances provide a crucial level of support for families. Current UI benefit amounts are commonly understood to be far too low. Given the insufficiency of UI, Congress rushed to create a supplemental benefit to support the millions of workers unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) provided workers with an additional $300 per week (initially $600). Recent studies of this expanded pandemic UI program have demonstrated how increased benefits propel economic growth.\n\nAs we described in 7 Things We Learned About Unemployment Insurance During the Pandemic, when some states prematurely ended FPUC, household spending dropped drastically. Specifically, for every dollar of reduced benefits, household spending fell by 52 cents.[10] On average, workers who lost these benefits lost $264 net income per week and spent $145 less per week. The Economic Policy Institute found that the elimination of federal unemployment expansions caused an estimated $144.3 billion of loss in income and a $79.2 billion decline in consumer spending nationwide.[11] The loss of the federal expansions also slowed national gross domestic product growth in the third quarter of 2021, according to the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis.[12]\n\nDependent allowances are an anti-poverty tool.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, two-thirds of working mothers were breadwinners or co-breadwinners for their families. Mothers of color and women in low-wage jobs are most likely to be the breadwinners for their families and less likely to be co-breadwinners.[13] Because of structural racism and sexism in the labor market, women—especially women of color—are often in precarious, inflexible, and underpaying work, causing more frequent and longer unemployment spells, which in turn leads to more barriers to employment.[14] For those who are even eligible for UI, many women will receive unemployment benefits that only replace a small portion of lost wages. Dependent allowances are crucial for filling in these gaps and supporting families.\n\nAs we have argued in a previous report, dependent allowances are a powerful anti-poverty tool. Households with children are much more likely to face food and housing insecurities when a job is lost. Even before the COVID-19 economic crisis, nearly 1 in 10 children in America lived in deep poverty, although that figure was closer to 1 in 5 for Black children, largely because of systemic racism.[15] Black and Latinx households endure pay disparities, leaving many struggling with less savings to rely on in times of crisis.[16] When surveyed, many households have indicated that UI is a key income source during times of crisis.\n\nAlthough a worker’s employment situation may temporarily change, their financial commitments do not. Many caregivers have financial needs such as rent, car payments, childcare, tuition, diapers, groceries, student loans, medical prescriptions, and more. These commitments, combined with inadequate UI benefits, can be even more challenging, especially for many single-parent households, compounding an already difficult economic situation.\n\nDependent allowances can help create an equitable labor market.\n\nAdequate UI benefits can increase or retain caregivers’ workforce participation while allowing workers to maintain vital supports. Caregiving challenges and shortages are cited as a top reason for reduced labor-force participation, especially among mothers.[17] In this environment of inaccessible care, Black and Latina women are most significantly impacted by having to shift to part-time work or leave employment completely.[18] Data shows that in times of crisis, mothers of children under five and single mothers are most vulnerable, with many leaving the workforce, struggling to reenter, and experiencing a “lifetime of consequences.”[19] Although women’s labor-force participation is steadily increasing, we risk losing progress without serious policy interventions. While communities grapple with safe, accessible, and affordable care shortages, dependent allowances can help caregivers maintain their care arrangements while they search for employment or if they are temporarily working part-time.\n\nData and State Comparison Resources\n\nAs of June 2022, there is no national dependent allowance data available, as states are not required to report dependent allowance data to the US Department of Labor (USDOL). Rather, dependent allowances are reported as part of a worker’s WBA. If your state has a dependent allowance, you can check your state labor department website to see if they report any data. If the data is not publicly reported, you may be able to request data from the state agency through a public records request.\n\nCompare state dependent allowances.\n\nConsult USDOL’s annual Comparison of State Unemployment Insurance Laws Chapter 3-20 for detailed comparisons of states’ dependent allowances, including:\n\nThe current state definitions of a dependent (Table 3-9)\n\nThe amount of various state dependent allowances (Table 3-10)\n\nFor an overview chart of key statistics on state UI programs, including quick comparisons of each state’s WBA, see USDOL’s annual Significant Provisions of UI State Laws. Both of these resources are updated annually, so table references may change.\n\nEvaluate your state’s Benefit Accuracy Measurement data.\n\nTo learn the amount of dependent allowance overpayments, you can view your state’s Benefit Accuracy Measurement data. Check your state labor agency website or USDOL’s website. This data includes fraud and agency error. Nationally, dependent allowances have the lowest overpayment rate.\n\nUnderstand your state’s household economic conditions.\n\nThe United States Census Bureau conducts a variety of surveys to understand economic conditions, including the Current Population Survey and the Census Household Pulse survey, which measures household experiences including food, housing, and childcare security.\n\nCalculate the cost of living in your state.\n\nEconomic Policy Institute’s Family Budget Calculator is a helpful tool for breaking down the average cost of living (including childcare expenses) in a city by household type and size. This can demonstrate the need for increased dependent allowances.\n\nUnderstand economic impacts by demographics.\n\nTo view national or state unemployment rates by race and ethnicity, Economic Policy Institute offers a quarterly breakdown. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics also releases national monthly Employment Situation data, including a breakdown by race and sex.\n\nReferences and Essential Articles\n\nDependent allowances\n\nJosh Bivens et al., Reforming Unemployment Insurance: Section 5 Benefit Levels, Center for American Progress, Center for Popular Democracy, Economic Policy Institute, Groundwork Collaborative, National Employment Law Project, National Women’s Law Center, and Washington Center for Equitable Growth, July 2021, starting at 90, https://www.nelp.org/publication/reforming-unemployment-insurance-stabilizing-a-system-in-crisis-and-laying-the-foundation-for-equity/.\n\nInequities in unemployment\n\nMonée Fields-White, Vivian Graubard, Alberto Rodríguez, Nikki Zeichner, and Cassandra Robertson, Unpacking Inequities in Unemployment Insurance, New America, September 17, 2020, https://www.newamerica.org/pit/reports/unpacking-inequities-unemployment-insurance/unemployment-insurance-isnt-enough-to-keep-the-family-fed.\n\nBenefit amounts fail to cover basic household expenses\n\nLiz Hipple and Alix Gould-Werth, Weak Income Support Infrastructure Harms U.S. Workers and Their Families and Constrains Economic Growth, Washington Center for Equitable Growth, August 5, 2021, https://equitablegrowth.org/weak-income-support-infrastructure-harms-u-s-workers-and-their-families-and-constrains-economic-growth/.\n\nAdditional talking points for expanding dependent coverage\n\nFact Sheet: The Importance of Inclusive, Realistic Family Definitions for Paid Leave, A Better Balance: Recognizing All Families, June 21, 2022, https://www.abetterbalance.org/our-issues/recognizing-all-families/.\n\n[1] Brynne Keith-Jennings, Catlin Nchako, and Joseph Llobrera, “Number of Families Struggling to Afford Food Rose Steeply in Pandemic and Remains High, Especially Among Children and Households of Color,” Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, April 27, 2021, https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/number-of-families-struggling-to-afford-food-rose-steeply-in-pandemic-and.\n\n[2] See Iowa Admin.

The United States is the only industrialized nation without a national paid parental leave law, while dozens of developing countries also have such policies.\n\n“No one should have to choose a paycheck over their health and the health of their family,” said Wendy Pollack, Women’s Law and Policy Initiative director at the Chicago-based Shriver Center on Poverty Law.\n\nThe coalition’s initial proposal – encapsulated in Senate Bill 1234 and House Bill 1530 – would cover all employers in Illinois and all employees who earn at least $1,600 annually. Paid leave would also apply to contract workers.\n\nThe benefits to workers would be paid out of a newly created special state fund. The law would require employers to pay 0.73 percent of the wages for their employees and contractors into the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Fund, similar to the state’s Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. An additional fee of up to 0.05 percent could be imposed through administrative rules for administering the program.\n\nThose who need paid leave would need to provide documentation of pregnancy, adoption or guardianship of a new child, their own injury or illness, or that of a sick family member. The leave policy would also cover military-related time off and time needed to recover from sexual assault or domestic violence.\n\nThose workers, if approved for leave, would receive 90 percent of their average weekly wages for their leave period, up to a maximum of $1,200 per week. Eventually that maximum would be adjusted to 90 percent of the average weekly wage in Illinois.\n\nThose potential payouts are in line with the policies of the 11 other states with paid leave laws, although no other state’s law is quite as permissive as the proposal being pushed in Illinois. For example, although Massachusetts allows for up to 26 weeks of total paid leave in one year, it provides for only 12 weeks of paid leave for new parents and those caring for a sick family member, and 20 weeks for those who can’t work due to a long-term illness.\n\nBut advocates pushing for paid leave in Illinois are aiming for loftier goals than the programs in other states.\n\nChristina Green, who now works for Chicago-based advocacy organization Women Employed, was only eligible for two weeks of leave when she gave birth to her son in 2020. She would only have had access to 12 weeks of paid maternity leave at the private school she worked at if she had been employed for seven or more years.\n\nInstead of returning to work after those two weeks, Green said she drained her savings in order to take the 12 weeks she anticipated needing. And even then, Green said it wasn’t enough.\n\n“It actually took me around 20 weeks to fully heal,” Green said. “Unfortunately I had no other options but to return to work…I literally budgeted down to the last dollar.”\n\nAngelica Arreguin, a single mom and temp agency worker who organizes with the Chicago Workers Collaborative, shared through an interpreter that she was fired by her former employer when she couldn’t return to her job because her “injury did not heal on their schedule.”\n\n“And if there comes a day that my children become ill and I need to leave work for a month, I expect to be fired instead of being allowed to return,” Arreguin said.\n\nAdvocates say paid parental leave would help ease the racial inequities suffered by women like Arreguin and Green, who is Black. The advocacy groups behind the proposal point to a permanent decrease in earnings for women who take time off to care for children or aging parents – an issue set to become more prominent as Baby Boomers age into needing more medical care over the next decade or so.\n\nThe coalition is also selling paid leave as a boon for businesses, especially in a labor market where many employers have found it difficult to find or re-hire workers in the wake of COVID-19.\n\nHouse sponsor state Rep. Sonya Harper, D-Chicago, said lack of a safety net is preventing many women from re-entering the workforce.\n\n“If women in Illinois participated in the labor force at the same rate as women in countries with paid leave, there would be an estimated 124,000 additional workers in the state and 4.4 billion more wages,” she said.\n\nBut business groups aren’t engaging with the proposal yet. Rob Karr, President and CEO of the influential Illinois Retail Merchants Association, turned the focus back to last month’s legislative agreement on five days of paid leave.\n\n“Our focus is on the proper implementation of the historic paid leave bill that just passed the General Assembly and has yet to even be signed into law by the governor,” Karr said in a statement.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/collecting-unemployment-benefits-illinois-32506-2.html', 'Headline': 'Amount and Duration of Unemployment Compensation in Illinois', 'Snippet': 'In Illinois, your weekly benefit amount is determined by adding together your earnings in the two quarters of the base period when you earned the most, taking 47% of that total, then dividing the result by 26.

The Bill was referred to the House Rules Committee on January 12, 2023, and we will continue monitoring the political and legal landscape of this legislation for developments.', 'Full_text': 'By Tracy Billows, Sara Fowler, Ala Salameh, Josh Seidman, and Meg Toth\n\nWhat You Need To Know:\n\nThe Illinois House recently introduced legislation that would create a statewide paid family leave insurance program.\n\nThe legislation would provide eligible Illinois employees with up to 12 weeks of leave in a 24-month period, to be used for time off needed due to family and medical reasons, including pregnancy, an employee’s own health condition, to bond with a child, or to care for a family member.\n\nThe program would be administered through IDES, and funded through employee payroll contributions.\n\nAs the new year unfolds, the Illinois Legislature is considering additional ways to provide employees with paid time off benefits. Days after passing the Paid Leave for All Workers Act, the House introduced Illinois House Bill 1102 – to implement a statewide family leave insurance program through the Illinois Department of Employment Security (“IDES”).\n\nEligible employees could take up to 12 weeks of family leave within a 24-month period for (1) pregnancy; (2) to be with a newborn child, a newly adopted or newly placed foster child; (3) for adoption; (4) to care for a family member with a serious health condition; (5) for an employee’s own serious health condition; or (6) certain military exigencies. Employees could receive 85% of their average wage, up to $881 in weekly compensation. The Bill would take effect immediately upon becoming law.\n\nThe Bill’s key provisions are as follows:\n\nEmployee Eligibility: Individuals working in Illinois (other than those working for the State) employed by the same employer for 12 months or more, who have worked 1,200 or more hours during the preceding 12-month period would come under the Bill’s protections.\n\nEmployer Coverage: Employers are defined broadly as any partnership, association, trust, estate, joint-stock company, insurance company, or corporation that has at least one employee performing services in Illinois, and any employer subject to the Unemployment Insurance Act.\n\nDuration of Leave: Up to twelve weeks of family leave within any 24-month period would be granted to eligible employees. Family leave could be taken on an intermittent basis for the qualifying conditions, except leave following birth or adoption would need to be for a continuous period of time unless agreed upon by the employer. Family leave would run concurrently with any FMLA leave. Employers can also require family leave to be taken concurrently with other employer leave policies, upon notice to employees.\n\nNotice: If an employee’s need for family leave is foreseeable, they would need to provide the employer with at least 30 days’ advance notice. Otherwise, notice would need to be given as soon as practicable. Employees would also be charged with making reasonable efforts to schedule foreseeable treatments so as to not unduly disrupt business operations.\n\nLeave Benefits: Eligible employees shall receive 85% of their average weekly wage, with a maximum of $881 in compensation per week. The Bill incorporates by reference the Unemployment Insurance Act’s determination of average weekly wage.\n\nState Benefits Fund: To cover the cost of the IDES-administered leave insurance, employers would be required to retain a payroll premium reduction of 0.5% from all employees, to be channeled into a newly created State Benefits Fund. Housed in the State Treasury, the Benefits Fund would be used for payment of leave benefits, and for administration of the Act.\n\nCollective Bargaining Agreements: If passed, the Bill would not affect any collective bargaining agreements in effect. The Bill states that its benefits cannot be diminished by a collective bargaining agreement entered into after the Bill’s effective date. But, it also states that, after the Bill becomes effective, its requirements could be waived in a collective bargaining agreement if done so in explicit terms. Hopefully this inconsistency is resolved through the legislative process prior to any enactment and exactly how the Act would address collective bargaining agreements remains to be seen.\n\nReinstatement and Anti-Retaliation: Employees who receive leave benefits through the State would be entitled to return to their position of employment held prior to taking leave, or return to an equivalent position with equal benefits, pay, and terms and conditions of employment. The Bill prohibits employers from taking adverse action against an individual who filed or expressed an intent to file a claim for leave insurance through IDES.\n\nExclusions: Insured family leave under the Bill excludes any time an eligible employee is paid under the Unemployment Insurance Act or Workers’ Compensation Act.\n\nThe Bill was referred to the House Rules Committee on January 12, 2023, and we will continue monitoring the political and legal landscape of this legislation for developments.\n\nAmid navigating dynamic paid leave requirements and responsibilities, employers should reach out to their Seyfarth contact for solutions and recommendations on addressing compliance.

Police officers testified to the violence and mayhem. Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.\n\nYet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public’s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained attack on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.\n\nBy excusing former President Donald Trump of responsibility, minimizing the mob’s violence and casting the rioters as martyrs, falsehoods about the insurrection aim to deflect blame for Jan. 6 while sustaining Trump’s unfounded claims about the free and fair election in 2020 that he lost.\n\nSpread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes.\n\nSeveral different conspiracy theories have emerged in the year since the insurrection, according to an analysis of online content by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs on behalf of The Associated Press. Unfounded claims that the rioters were members of antifa went viral first, only to be overtaken by a baseless claim blaming FBI operatives. Other theories say the rioters were peaceful and were framed for crimes that never happened.\n\nConspiracy theories have long lurked in the background of American history, said Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University professor who studies political misinformation. But they can become dangerous when they lead people to distrust democracy or to excuse or embrace violence.\n\n“If we’re no longer operating from the same foundation of facts, then it’s going to be a lot harder to have conversations as a country,” Carnahan said. “It will fuel more divisions in our country, and I think that ultimately is the legacy of the misinformation we’re seeing right now.”\n\nAn examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T TRUMP SUPPORTERS\n\nIn fact, many of those who came to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said — proudly, publicly, repeatedly — that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nDifferent versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa.\n\n“Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,” Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.”\n\nThe next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim.\n\nAnother Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven’t been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants.\n\nYet Carlson claimed on his show that “in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.”\n\nCarlson is a “main driver” of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal’s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.\n\n“Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,” Gaetz said.\n\nSpokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.\n\nIn truth, the rioters are just who they said they were.\n\nOne was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.\n\n“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans said on the video. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” Vice President Mike Pence was in the building to preside over the Senate’s certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. Pence went ahead despite Trump’s pleas to get Pence to block the transfer of power.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by “fake Trump protesters.”\n\n“We have not seen evidence of that,” said Wray, who was appointed by Trump.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T VIOLENT\n\nDozens of police officers were severely injured. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and died a day later of natural causes.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who rushed to the scene, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” The assault stopped only when he said he had children. He later learned he had suffered a heart attack. Fanone resigned from the department in December 2021.\n\nRioters broke into the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled under armed protection. They rifled through desks and looked for lawmakers, yelling, “Where are they?” In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.\n\nThat’s not how some Republican politicians have described the insurrection.\n\nAppearing on Ingraham’s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.\n\n“By and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has since said that he doesn’t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a “normal tourist visit.” Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.\n\nTrump called the insurrection a display of “ spirit and faith and love.”\n\nRioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose.\n\n“The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,” Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. “And, you know, I won’t be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.”\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS\n\nTrump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nImmediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been “cheated” and “defrauded” in the “rigged” election by a “criminal enterprise” that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol.\n\nAt one point, Trump did urge his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.” The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric.\n\n“We fight. We fight like hell,” he told those who would later break into the Capitol. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nNow, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.\n\n“I wasn’t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,” Trump said on Fox News in December.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN OFFICER WORKING FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nBabbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed. An investigation cleared the officer of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Capitol Police Department protects all members of Congress, as well as employees, the public and Capitol facilities. The officer wasn’t assigned to any particular lawmaker.\n\nTrump falsely claimed the officer was the head of security “for a certain high official, a Democrat,” and was being shielded from accountability. He also misstated where Babbitt was shot.\n\n“Who is the person that shot … an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?” Trump asked on Fox News.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE JAN. 6 SUSPECTS ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ARE BEING MISTREATED\n\nNo, they are not, despite some assertions from members of Congress.\n\n“J6 defendants are political prisoners of war,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted in November. She said she had visited some suspects in jail who complained about the food, medical care and “re-education” they were receiving in custody.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said the Justice Department was “harassing peaceful patriots” by investigating their involvement in the insurrection.\n\nWhile it’s true some of the suspects have complained about their time in jail, it’s wrong to argue they’re being held as political prisoners. Authorities have said the suspects in custody are being given the same access to food and medical care as any other inmate.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-manufactured-martyr-ashli-babbitt-191518760.html', 'Headline': 'Trump’s ‘manufactured martyr’: How Ashli Babbitt’s death was weaponised ...', 'Snippet': 'Even so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents.

He could say ‘her’ or ‘she; or whatever.

She was part of a crowd of Trump supporters that had stormed the seat of the US Senate to stop it ratifying the election result, with some allegedly planning to do so by armed force.\n\nIn a less polarised era, American politicians in both parties might have rallied around the officer who shot her. Today, though, she has become a martyr to many of Mr Trump’s followers, praised and venerated by a movement that is increasingly willing to endorse political violence to keep its opponents out of power.\n\nRepublican members of congress including Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Matt Gaetz of Florida have taken up her cause, as have Fox News, the pro-Trump TV station Newsmax and even Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne right-wing group, Look Ahead America, has called for a vigil in Babbitt’s name for those in prison awaiting trial for their alleged actions on 6 January. Donations to a ""Justice for Ashli Babbitt legal fund"" continue to pour in, with more than $378,000 (£278,500) raised as of Wednesday.\n\nFollow live updates on the January 6 anniversary\n\nMr Trump himself has been her cheerleader in chief, referring to her death as a murder. and offering her family his ""unwavering"" support"". ""To Ashli’s family and friends, please know that her memory will live on in our hearts for all time,"" he said in a video specially filmed for her birthday on 10 October. ""There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli.""\n\nTerrorism experts and anti-racist groups find the former president’s intervention deeply disturbing, comparing it to the way Islamic fundamentalists and the Nazi Party in the 1940s used manufactured martyrs to inspire further acts of violence.\n\nFor Cara Castronuova, a pro-Trump activist who co-founded the group Citizens Against Political Persecution to advocate for alleged January 6 rioters, it is a vindication of many months fighting to reframe the storming of the Capitol as a peaceful protest and its alleged invaders as political prisoners.\n\n""At first her name was taboo, even in conservative media,"" Ms Castronuova tells The Independent. ""Nobody would talk about her, nobody would mention her, nobody would mention anybody’s name from 6 January. There was a three to four month block of time at the beginning of 2020... and then it just snowballed.""\n\nWho was Ashli Babbitt?\n\nWhen Ashli Babbitt quit the US military in 2016, she left at the rank of senior airman with 12 years of service and eight deployments behind her. Having enlisted in the US Air Force (USAF) straight out of high school in 2003, she protected bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, protected USAF bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Katar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAt one point, she had even guarded the seat of the US government, serving in an Air National Guard unit known as the ""Capital Guardians"" at a base near Washington DC. In 2013, she was part of the DC Air National Guard’s security detail for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nBabbitt grew up in Lakeside, California, not far from San Diego, the oldest sister to four younger brothers. One former classmate told Insider that she was ""disruptive"" in class, highly opinionated and always trying to be ""one of the guys"".\n\nThat bolshy nature survived throughout her service, with former comrades saying she struggled to be promoted and was demoted at least once due to spats with superiors. One friend described her as ""small but mighty"" (Babbitt was 5 feet 2 inches tall), unafraid to contradict her officers when she disagreed.\n\n""Ashli was headstrong and impulsive,"" said Sgt Eirik Blackwolf, who served with her in the DC Air National Guard. ""She didn’t hold back on her opinion to anyone, no matter their rank, especially if she thought they were wrong or behaving unethically.""\n\nDuring one deployment Babbitt was injured in a mortar strike that knocked her onto a pile of debris. Augustine Luna, a close friend, told Insider that the impact damaged Babbitt’s uterus and left her unable to bear children, but that Babbitt rarely mentioned this.\n\nIn 2015 Babbitt began working as a private security guard for a nuclear power plant in Maryland, where she met her future second husband Aaron Babbitt. That was also the year Mr Babbitt’s then-girlfriend Celeste Norris first encountered Ashli.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ms Norris said Mr Babbitt at first described the new girl as ""this foul-mouthed chick that’s on shift"". Later, Ms Norris found out the two were dating, and broke up with Mr Babbitt.\n\nThe next year, Ms Norris said, she was waiting at a stop sign when a white SUV barged through nearby traffic and repeatedly rammed into her car. When they stopped, Babbitt got out and began hammering with her hand on the window. ""It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was,"" said Ms Norris. ""Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.""\n\nA court acquitted Babbitt of criminal charges, but Ms Norris secured a restraining order against her, and later mounted a personal injury lawsuit that Babbitt settled out of court. In court documents from 2017, Ms Norris wrote that Babbitt had continued to follow her home from work and harass her. ""I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,"" she told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Babbitt moved to San Diego to help buy out and run a swimming pool supply company where her brothers, her uncle and her husband all worked together. ""It was kind of nice, a family affair,"" her brother Roger said.\n\nBabbitt and her husband became daily customers at a brewery near the San Diego sea front, often with their three ex-military dogs in tow. According to brewery owner Jim Millea, the pair had a polyamorous relationship with one of his bartenders. Babbitt herself often arrived fuming about a political issue that had grabbed her attention.\n\nYet the pool supply business quickly got into trouble. Babbitt took out a short term business loan with a steep interest rate and was sued by the lender for failing to make payments, ultimately being ordered by a judge to pay it all back. In 2019, she sold the house where her parents had lived for nearly 20 years, reportedly making them feel ""kicked out of their own home"".\n\nBy this time, Babbitt was a staunch Trump supporter and an opponent of lockdown measures. Her company’s office bore a sign reading: ""Mask-free autonomous zone, better known As America"".\n\nHer brother told the New York Times that she had felt free after leaving the military, and had been angry with the number of homeless people in San Diego and the challenges for small business owners.\n\nOne customer told CBS 8 San Diego that he dropped Babbitt’s company after she went on an unprovoked political rant. “She just started talking about people who oppose Trump and about Nancy Pelosi and [Chuck] Schumer and homeless people,"" the customer said. ""A lot of it didn’t even make any sense. It literally went on for about a minute and a half... it was shocking that she would be talking to a customer the way she was talking to me.""\n\nEven so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents. ""I don’t really know why she decided to do this,"" her mother-in-law toldFox 5 Washington DC last year.\n\nHer social media accounts, however, told an all too familiar story.\n\n‘Nothing will stop us’\n\nOn 7 September, 2020, tweeting under the username @CommonSenseAsh, Ashli Babbitt posted a photo of herself smiling in sunglasses and a black tank top, posing in front of an old-fashioned boat in the harbour of San Diego.\n\nTo many the photo might have looked innocuous, a happy selfie from a nice day out. But her shirt bore the slogan ""We are Q"" – a reference to the anonymous purported government insider who inspired the cult-like millenarian movement known as QAnon.\n\nFor almost a year, Babbitt had been posting in support of QAnon, which believes Mr Trump’s Democratic opponents are part of a global Satanist paedophile ring. Adherents think Mr Trump himself is the figurehead for a secret plot by ""white hats"" (ie, good guys) to sweep the Satanists from power in a military coup, resulting in mass imprisonment or execution.\n\nThe movement has been tied to violent acts including murders, kidnappings, terror plots, attempted bombings, and vehicular attacks, as well as campaigns of online harassment and death threats.\n\nBabbitt’s radical shift came gradually. Back in 2018, she had told another user that she had voted for Barack Obama and still believed he had done ""great things"", but had turned to Mr Trump because she could not stomach Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Ms Luna, Babbitt had voted for Trump in 2016 because he was not a career politician, but soon began calling Democrats ""commies"" and skirmished aggressively offline and online with anyone who disputed her anti-mask beliefs.\n\nIn November 2019, she tweeted about Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that went viral among Trump supporters in 2016 and was a key precursor to QAnon. Online activists had fixated on chance words in hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders as evidence of a secret child sex dungeon beneath a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. Later one of them stormed the restaurant with a rifle to rescue the supposed children, but found nothing.\n\nIn February 2020, Babbitt tweeted her first of many QAnon slogans. Most often she retweeted QAnon influencers such as the lawyer Lin Wood. Ms Luna told Insider that Babbitt was drawn in by the idea that children were in danger, spending hours every week reading about missing kids and appalled that QAnon’s claims were not being taken seriously in the mainstream media.\n\nAccording to Prof Mia Bloom, a terrorism researcher at Georgia University, QAnon’s appeals to ""save the children"" are ""almost verbatim"" how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) recruited three British schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, London, in 2015.\n\n""This kind of message that builds upon someone’s innate goodness is a very different pathway into terrorism than we ordinarily think,"" says Prof Bloom. ""We assume that it’s about hatred, it’s about violence, it’s about racism and white supremacy on the Right and jihadi ideology for [Islamic] groups, when in fact a lot of the pull factors can be based in what we would consider to be very positive attributes.""\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Babbitt did not accept the results of the 2020 election and plunged wholeheartedly into the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. On 1 January, 2021, Babbitt tweeted that she would be in Washington DC on the 6th for a rally addressed by Mr Trump.\n\nOn 5 January, she boarded a plane in San Diego and texted to her friend that there were ""tons of Trump supporters"" flying with her. Another user tweeted that some flights to DC were being cancelled, supposedly to prevent people from attending the 6 January rally.\n\nBabbitt replied: ""Nothing will stop us. They can try and try and try, but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.""\n\nWhen Trump’s army stormed the Capitol, Ashli Babbitt was among the mob that gathered in a stairwell near the chamber of the House of Representatives, where up to 80 members of congress and staff were sheltering. She was wearing a Trump flag on her shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe crowd began hammering on the doors out of the stairwell, which were barricaded from the other side with furniture. One window broke, and Ashli Babbitt, who was unarmed, climbed through. A gunshot rang out, and she fell back with a bullet in her shoulder.\n\nPro-Trump activists have found their George Floyd\n\nLast August, the police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt finally broke his silence. For months Lt Michael Byrd, who is black, had been in hiding due to repeated death threats and racist attacks after Mr Trump falsely claimed he worked for a ""high-ranking"" Democratic politician.\n\n""I know that day I saved countless lives,"" Lt Byrd told NBC News. “I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nBabbitt did not become a Trumpist hero overnight. The day after the riot, Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin, who saw Babbitt’s death, said that Lt Byrd had not had any choice. ""The mob was going to come through the door,"" he told ABC. ""There was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many Trump supporters believed she was a plant or a stooge, put into the crowd by the FBI or other dark forces. In April, the US Department of Justice closed its investigation with no criminal charges.\n\nBy the time of Lt Byrd’s interview, however, Babbitt’s name had become a clarion call in what Ms Castronuova calls the conservative ""underground"" of alternative media and social media. Ms Castronuova was among the first people to interview Babbitt’s family on InfoWars, a fringe news site that often promotes conspiracy theories and has been banned from most major social networks for hate speech.\n\n""[Trump] is really in tune with the community, his base,"" Ms Castronuova says. ""The underground will start to buzz, then Donald Trump picks up on it."" Soon enough, at rallies and in interviews last summer, Mr Trump was calling Babbitt ""an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman"", someone who was on his ""side"", and said there was ""no reason for"" her to die. Ms Castronuova says his backing was ""instrumental"".\n\nMr Trump’s efforts increased after a personal phone call to Mrs Witthoeft, who had become politically active. She has now spoken at a Trump rally and has backed her daughter’s actions, saying: ""She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.""\n\nMs Castronuova says: ""[Babbitt’s] mother has been really instrumental too. She became quite an advocate. She was afraid to speak out at first... but when she finally started speaking out, things really started to change.""\n\nBabbitt’s family sued the District of Columbia to uncover Lt Byrd’s identity, and plans to file wrongful death lawsuits against Lt Byrd himself and the Capitol Police. Terrell Roberts III, a lawyer for Babbitt’s husband Aaron, declined to comment and declined an interview on Mr Babbitt’s behalf.\n\nDonations to Mr Babbitt’s legal fund continue to roll in, with many donors identifying themselves as military veterans. Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating Democratic secrets.\n\nMany Trump supporters have compared Babbitt to George Floyd, a black man murdered by police in Minnesota, lifting the Black Lives Matter slogan ""say her name"" used in reference to many victims of police brutality.\n\nOn the private messaging app Telegram, which is popular on the far right, pro-Trump channels frequently invoke Babbitt’s name, sharing news articles about her family’s lawsuit or claiming that she was set up by informants. Many asked the question ""who killed Ashli Babbit?"" which Mr Trump later echoed.\n\n""The entire scenario looks to be staged. So who is the rotting fish head of what appears to be a deliberate false flag? Who or what group set this up?"" said the evangelist channel Veteran Patriots. The Proud Boys, a fascist militia, have begun using a stylised image of Babbitt as a logo, with the slogan: ""They can’t kill us all.""\n\nBritish radicals have also taken up her cause. ""Her name was Ashli Babbitt,"" said British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. ""She was murdered by the state and her name was dragged through the mud by the media."" An account identifying itself as former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has invoked her name several times.\n\nSome appear to believe she is not even dead. ""Ashli Babbitt false [is a] flag, she’s alive living underground,"" said a QAnon channel called Gitmo TV.\n\n‘A weapon of mass radicalisation’\n\nTo Prof Bloom, Babbitt’s transformation into an innocent victim of Leftist injustice has a worrying historical echo: Horst Wessel, the young Nazi street-fighter who was turned into a symbol of fascist heroism by Josef Goebbel’s propaganda apparatus.\n\nWessel was shot in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party, probably as part of a dispute over unpaid rent with his Communist landlady. By 1936, after the Nazis took power, official media referred to him as greater than Jesus Christ and the Horst Wessel Song was Germany’s joint national anthem.\n\n""Fake martyrdoms succeed because they feed off the shared grievances and anger of the crowd, serving as justification for future retaliatory violence,"" wrote Prof Bloom and another researcher, Sophia Moskalenko, with whom Prof Bloom has co-authored a book about QAnon. ""Ashli Babbitt’s unfortunate death is a weapon of mass radicalisation, just like Horst Wessel’s death was manipulated by Goebbels.""\n\nIndeed, the Nazis’ modern successors have particularly embraced Babbitt, turning an enthusiastic Trump supporter with a chequered past who was killed in a chaotic riot into a towering hero or innocent victim of police brutality while seeking to pin the blame on black and Jewish people.\n\n""Unlike ‘Saint Floyd’, Ashli Babbitt will receive no justice from this sick anti-white system,"" said one white supremacist Telegram channel. ""But we will always remember her sacrifice and she will never be forgotten. There is a day coming not far from now when we will erect statues in her honor.""\n\nThe same channel referred to Lt Byrd as a ""black parasite who gets to kill an unarmed white woman and walk around unbothered"", threatening to make him ""account for his actions"". Another neo-Nazi channel claimed that ""Ashli Babbitt was killed because she was white"".\n\nAlex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates against antisemitism and other forms of racism, says such messages are part of a widespread effort by white supremacists to lure recruits from the broader pro-Trump community.\n\n""White supremacists will always try to twist whatever major story is in the news to fit their agenda,"" says Mr Friedfeld. It’s unclear how successful these efforts have been, but the fact that they are trying to leverage the Babbitt story is deeply concerning because it raises the likelihood that someone is radicalised.""\n\nProf Bloom agrees, comparing it to the Proud Boys’ attempts last summer to recruit ""incel"" anti-feminists. She says that while many QAnon believers are not consciously racist, and not all are white, the movement has a pervasive racial bias, with trafficked children usually depicted as white whereas real world child trafficking disproportionately affects children of colour.\n\nProf Bloom also points out that another protester, Rosanne Boyland, died during the riot but has not been turned into a martyr in the same way. The reason, she argues, is that unlike Babbitt’s family, the Boyland’s have blamed Mr Trump for their loved one’s death.\n\nA threat from within America’s military\n\nThe martyrdom of Ashli Babbitt paints a foreboding picture of where American politics is going. To Prof Bloom and Prof Moskalenko, martyrs are a ubiquitous manufactured product of radical movements, useful because of their potency in rallying followers to stay in the fight and seek revenge against the enemy.\n\nMs Castronuova stops short of saying Babbitt was an example others should follow, describing her as a good person sucked into an ""emotionally charged"" and chaotic situation. She is happy to call Babbitt a martyr, claiming: ""She was killed because of her political beliefs, and they continue to kill her image and her memory because of her political beliefs. If she was a liberal and she hated Donald Trump, she would be remembered very fondly by the media.""\n\nMr Friedfelder, however, fears that Babbitt’s lionisation could contribute to an escalating cycle of conflict, and considers politicians’ embrace of Babbitt to be dangerous. While most Republicans have not embraced the idea that she was unjustly killed, few have publicly rebuked it, apparently reluctant to openly challenge Mr Trump even now he is out of office.\n\nThat does not mean they are happy behind the scenes. On Wednesday Mr Trump cancelled a press conference on the anniversary of the riot, reportedly under pressure from mainstream Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he had played golf with Mr Trump at the weekend and warned him that there ""could be peril"" in such an event. Still, history suggests that Mr Trump’s concessions to moderates are rarely permanent.\n\nMr Friedfelder says: ""Her martyrdom turns her into a call to action... it is one thing for extremists to embrace Babbitt, but it is another for the former president and several high-profile members of the Republican Party to do the same. These officials are supposed to be trusted figures and people look to them for guidance when trying to understand national events.""\n\nClaims that Babbitt was murdered or assassinated continue to spread on social media, according to data from the online discussion tracking firm Zignal Labs. Mr Trump’s and Mr Putin’s comments caused spikes in mentions of Babbitt, and the general discussion around 6 January has barely waned over the past year.\n\nProf Bloom believes there is a more acute threat too: Babbitt’s military record. According to a report from START, an academic coalition that studies terrorism, at least 118 of the 719 people charged in connection with the riot, about 16 per cent of the whole, are veterans. In a START extremism database, about 7 per cent of all far-right cases had military experience, with the rest simply listed as unknown.\n\n""We don’t know how many American military [members] have been radicalised, either by MAGA or specifically by QAnon and white supremacy,"" says Prof Bloom. ""There has been a problem of white supremacy in the military for decades that the military has been reticent to deal with.\n\n""It’s dangerous because it’s not just some flunky who wants to make a name for themselves. It’s someone with military training who has weapons and knows how to use them."" She compares most pro-Trump extremists with the bumbling jihadists in 2010’s Four Lions, with lots of anger but limited ways to direct it. ""When you have someone who has been trained by the military or law enforcement, they know how to use that anger.""\n\nProf Moskalenko worries that the conditions are set for yet more political violence in America. ""A martyrdom is a symbol of perceived widespread injustice and suffering. There’s a lot of that going around,"" she says. ""With or without Ashli Babbit, we have problems. Addressing them, rather than getting stuck in the never-ending cycle of rhetoric, competing narratives, and shifting moral frames, is our only hope.""'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/01/06/ashli-babbitts-mom-defends-daughters-actions-at-jan-6riot/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's mom defends daughter's actions at Jan. 6riot"", 'Snippet': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot during the Jan. 6 riot, stood on the Capitol steps on the riot’s anniversary to claim that her daughter was exercising her right to protest ...', 'Full_text': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, the woman fatally shot during the Jan. 6 riot, stood on the Capitol steps Thursday and claimed her daughter was exercising a legitimate right to protest when she was killed by a US Capitol police officer one year ago.\n\n“My daughter was an amazing, energetic, independent, powerful woman.

Michael Byrd as she tried to crawl through a broken window to enter the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021 as a mob of Trump supporters were storming the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“My daughter was a proud American patriot,” Witthoeft said. “She served this country her whole adult life. She loved God, America and loved her family.”\n\nWitthoeft then claimed her daughter was “murdered by a careless, reckless” Capitol Police officer.\n\n“She came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election, and little did we know that would be the last time she heard anybody speak,” the grieving mom said.\n\nByrd was exonerated of any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death in an internal use-of-force probe.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News last August, Byrd said he was “doing my job” and saw Babbitt as a threat to lawmakers in the House of Representatives.\n\n“I was very afraid,” Byrd told anchor Lester Holt. “I’m hearing about the breaches of different barricaded areas, officers being overrun, officers being down.”\n\nWitthoeft also called for the release of 14,000 hours of video captured on security cameras in the Capitol.\n\n“I would like to say to [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi, this is not your playhouse. These surveillance cameras were put up to capture what happened that day and the American people have the right to see the 14,000 hours of footage,” she said. “You’re not the queen, Nancy Pelosi, this is America’s 14,000 hours of missing footage and we have a right to see it.”\n\nCapitol Police and prosecutors have refused to release the footage, because they contend it could threaten the security of the building.\n\nBut federal judge Beryl Howell ruled in September that the “public has an interest in understanding the conduct underlying the charges in these cases” and ordered the footage to be released in the trial of protester Eric Torrens of Tennessee.\n\n“The Capitol police operate with impunity, which I did not know until my daughter was publicly executed,” Witthoeft said.\n\n“I think most of America does not know the Capitol police department is not subject to transparency – they are another arm of Congress and don’t answer to an external review like every other police department in this country,” she said.\n\nThe Justice Department has arrested and charged more than 725 people for their involvement in the Capitol attacks.\n\nWitthoeft said those arrested are being held unfairly.\n\n“We have political prisoners in America, not some third world country, to this day in solitary confinement denied due process.

""Ashli Babbitt tried to stop antifa false flag on Jan. 6,"" said the title of one video posted Jan. 19, 2022.\n\n""She was trying to stop those people from busting up the place, and then had to flee from them,"" the speaker in the video said. ""That’s why she went through the window, and then got shot, got assassinated by that f------- rent-a-cop.""\n\nThe video offered a conspiratorial retelling of what transpired during one of day’s most scrutinized moments, when Babbitt attempted to climb through the shattered window of a door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby, where lawmakers were being evacuated. It relied on an interpretation of Jan. 6 footage from a right-wing outlet that made unsubstantiated claims about Babbitt’s words, actions and frame of mind in the moments before she died.\n\nIn reality, there is no clear evidence that Babbitt was fighting to halt the mob — or that the attack was a false flag spurred on by antifa.\n\nThe insurrection was carried out by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, many of them whipped up by his false claims of a stolen election. The officer who fired the bullet that killed Babbitt — Lt. Michael Byrd, a Capitol Police officer for 28 years — was cleared of wrongdoing in two investigations.\n\nA video spread on YouTube and other platforms wrongly claimed Ashli Babbitt tried to stop an antifa false flag on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThis video spread widely anyway, racking up 200,000 views on YouTube and tens of thousands more on the alternative platforms like Rumble and Bitchute. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nA litany of false and conspiratorial claims\n\nThe creator of the video is a self-described former Obama voter and special education teacher who now posts live-streams and other content under the persona ""the Salty Cracker.""\n\nHis website has a disclaimer at the bottom of his website that reads, ""These are the opinions and ramblings of a lunatic. They are for entertainment purposes only and are probably wrong.""\n\nMany of his claims in the nearly 10-minute video were, as promised, wrong:\n\nHe called the attack a ""false flag hoax."" It wasn’t. It was an effort to flip an election that left several people dead, more than 140 officers injured, and $1.5 million in property damage.\n\nHe insisted that a man named Ray Epps instigated the siege as one of several ""FBI assets."" That’s not true. There is no evidence that the FBI orchestrated the attack, and Epps, a former Oath Keeper seen near the Capitol on videos, told the House committee investigating the attack that he has no ties to the FBI or law enforcement.\n\nHe said that the rioters who supported Trump were sentenced to 40 years in prison for ""staying in between the velvet lines."" That’s false. Claims that Jan. 6 was a ""normal tourist visit"" are Pants on Fire, and the longest sentence handed down to date was for 63 months.\n\nNo documented antifa presence\n\nThroughout his video, the Salty Cracker claimed that Babbitt was trying to stop antifa activists in disguise ""who were breaking into the f------ Speaker’s Lobby over here, and then got shot.""\n\nHere’s how he described what happened before her death:\n\n""All of the Trump supporters (were) trying to stop these people from breaking windows, trying to stop these people from setting the place on fire. Donald Trump supporters trying to extinguish the false flag, and apparently Ashli Babbitt was one of these individuals, and we got it on tape … As she’s trying to stop them, then they start chasing her. So then she’s got to climb through. She can’t go backwards, so she’s got to go forward.""\n\nBut several rioters denied the antifa rumors themselves in social media posts and messages. PolitiFact rated the claim that antifa provoked Babbitt’s shooting Pants on Fire, one of the many falsehoods about the Jan. 6 attack that merited PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year designation.\n\nRELATED VIDEO\n\n""We have no cases of antifa in our database of individuals charged with breaking into the Capitol,"" said Roderick Cowan, the executive director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, which maintains a database on the more than 700 people facing charges. ""Nor have we ever seen evidence of a named individual who supports antifa there.""\n\nAmong the rioters nearby when Babbitt died were Zachary Alam, the rioter wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat who smashed the windows to the Speaker’s Lobby that Babbitt later climbed through; Chad Barrett Jones, who helped bust the glass with a rolled-up Trump flag; and Thomas Baranyi, who wore a Trump-Pence hat and left the Capitol with Babbitt’s blood smeared on his hand.\n\nA speculative video analysis\n\nBut what about the pro-Trump mob? Was Babbitt trying to fend those rioters off?\n\nThroughout his video, the Salty Cracker read from an article in the Epoch Times, a pro-Trump outlet, with the headline: ""Babbitt tried to stop attack on Capitol Speaker’s Lobby, video shows.""\n\nThe article largely ignored the actions that prompted Babbitt’s fatal shooting, when she tried to push through the window to the Speaker’s Lobby. In an interview after the riot, Baranyi said the police were warning her to stop, but that ""she didn’t heed the call.""\n\nThe article instead focused on the buildup to that moment, claiming that the footage captured by those who were there, when slowed down, showed Babbitt trying ""to prevent the attack, not join it."" Some of that footage came from John Sullivan, an activist controversial on both sides of the political spectrum, whose presence fueled the antifa falsehood, and who faces several charges.\n\nThe Epoch Times’ evidence for its assertion: that Babbitt had ""looks of shock and concern"" on her face; that she was ""so distressed at the violence, she jumped up and down in frustration""; that she ""confronted"" Alam before he punched the window she later climbed through; that she winced at his punch; that and she at one point shouted, ""Stop! No! Don’t! Wait!""\n\nThose claims are speculative and unsubstantiated. Videos of the incident do not clearly capture all that Babbitt was saying and doing, let alone feeling, at the time.\n\nWhether Babbitt was feeling shocked and concerned, and whether she was jumping because she was frustrated, is also a matter of interpretation.\n\nOther footage from Tayler Hansen, a self-described ""independent journalist"" whose Twitter account includes statements of support for conservative causes, shows Babbitt leaning toward Alam and appearing to say something. But it’s not clear that she was confronting him.\n\nExperts in multimedia forensics told PolitiFact it’s nearly impossible to discern from Sullivan’s video what Babbitt was saying. She’s far away from Sullivan’s microphone in a loud room with many people shouting, making it difficult to attribute speech directly to her.\n\n""This is a classic ‘cocktail party effect’ recording of an unknown number of speakers, overlapped, speaking loud,"" said Catalin Grigoras, director of the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado, Denver. Grigoras and other experts said the science available to experts would likely be unable to isolate Babbitt’s voice from Sullivan’s video.\n\nOne rioter recalled for investigators that Babbitt said something along the lines of, ""Just open the door. They’re not gonna stop."" And another video recorded by Hansen showed Babbitt shouting at the officers. (It’s not clear what Babbitt is saying in that clip, either, experts said.)\n\nTrump supporters try to break through a police barrier on Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington. (AP)\n\nThe Epoch Times article also quoted from Hansen and Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt.\n\nHansen told the Epoch Times that Babbitt was ""literally trapped"" in a corner. Aaron Babbitt said she climbed through the window because she feared for her life and wanted to escape.\n\nBut Hansen’s video shows that Babbitt was the first to reach the doors leading to the Speaker’s Lobby.

Babbitt was shot as she attempted to climb through the shattered window of a door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby.\n\nThere was no documented trace of antifa involvement at the Capitol or in her shooting, and the suggestion that Babbitt was trying to stop the mob’s advances was based largely on speculation about what she was doing, saying and feeling in the moments leading up to her death.\n\nWe rate this YouTube video Pants on Fire!'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://reason.com/2022/01/04/ashli-babbitts-violent-past-doesnt-justify-her-death/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's Violent Past Doesn't Justify Her Death - Reason.com"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt\'s Violent Past Doesn\'t Justify Her Death. After the cops killed her, the A.P. gave her the ""no angel"" treatment. On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli ...', 'Full_text': 'On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli Babbitt, the Capitol rioter who was shot and killed by a police officer while trying to enter the Speaker\'s Lobby on January 6. In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist - The New York ...', 'Snippet': 'The New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence ...', 'Full_text': 'A mountain of evidence shows that the rioters were supporters of Mr. Trump, but that has not stopped the cascade of specious claims seeking to pin responsibility on others.\n\nA false theory blaming agitators affiliated with antifa, a loose collection of antifascist activists, began to spread on social media before the riot had even ended. Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-breach/police-chief-turned-yoga-instructor-insists-ashli-babbitt-is-not-dead-before-jan-6-judge-locks-him-up-for-more-than-a-decade/', 'Headline': ""Alan Hostetter insists Ashli Babbitt didn't die on Jan. 6 - Law & Crime"", 'Snippet': 'Police chief turned yoga instructor insists Ashli Babbitt is not dead before Jan. 6 judge locks him up for more than a decade.

Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas. He must reportedly surrender on or after Jan. 5, 2024.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2023/06/19/fbi-resisted-opening-probe-into-trumps-role-jan-6-more-than-year/', 'Headline': 'FBI resisted opening probe into Trump’s role in Jan. 6 for more than a ...', 'Snippet': 'The U.S. attorney’s office and the FBI had specialized teams probing the death of Capitol Police officer Brian D. Sicknick and the police shooting of rioter Ashli Babbitt.', 'Full_text': 'Hours after he was sworn in as attorney general, Merrick Garland and his deputies gathered in a wood-paneled conference room in the Justice Department for a private briefing on the investigation he had promised to make his highest priority: bringing to justice those responsible for the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nIn the two months since the siege, federal agents had conducted 709 searches, charged 278 rioters and identified 885 likely suspects, said Michael R. Sherwin, then-acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, ticking through a slide presentation. Garland and some of his deputies nodded approvingly at the stats, and the new attorney general called the progress “remarkable,” according to people in the room.\n\nSherwin’s office, with the help of the FBI, was responsible for prosecuting all crimes stemming from the Jan. 6 attack. He had made headlines the day after by refusing to rule out the possibility that President Donald Trump himself could be culpable. “We are looking at all actors, not only the people who went into the building,” Sherwin said in response to a reporter’s question about Trump. “If the evidence fits the elements of a crime, they’re going to be charged.”\n\nBut according to a copy of the briefing document, absent from Sherwin’s 11-page presentation to Garland on March 11, 2021, was any reference to Trump or his advisers — those who did not go to the Capitol riot but orchestrated events that led to it.\n\nA Washington Post investigation found that more than a year would pass before prosecutors and FBI agents jointly embarked on a formal probe of actions directed from the White House to try to steal the election. Even then, the FBI stopped short of identifying the former president as a focus of that investigation.\n\nA wariness about appearing partisan, institutional caution, and clashes over how much evidence was sufficient to investigate the actions of Trump and those around him all contributed to the slow pace. Garland and the deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, charted a cautious course aimed at restoring public trust in the department while some prosecutors below them chafed, feeling top officials were shying away from looking at evidence of potential crimes by Trump and those close to him, The Post found.\n\nIn November 2022, after Trump announced he was again running for president, making him a potential 2024 rival to President Biden, Garland appointed special counsel Jack Smith to take over the investigation into Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn June 8, in a separate investigation that was also turned over to the special counsel, Smith secured a grand jury indictment against the former president for mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Trump was charged with 31 counts of violating a part of the Espionage Act, as well as six counts arising from alleged efforts to mislead federal investigators.\n\nThe effort to investigate Trump over classified records has had its own obstacles, including FBI agents who resisted raiding the former president’s home. But the discovery of top-secret documents in Trump’s possession triggered an urgent national security investigation that laid out a well-defined legal path for prosecutors, compared with the unprecedented task of building a case against Trump for trying to steal the election.\n\nWhether a decision about Trump’s culpability for Jan. 6 could have come any earlier is unclear. The delays in examining that question began before Garland was even confirmed. Sherwin, senior Justice Department officials and Paul Abbate, the top deputy to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, quashed a plan by prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office to directly investigate Trump associates for any links to the riot, deeming it premature, according to five individuals familiar with the decision. Instead, they insisted on a methodical approach — focusing first on rioters and going up the ladder.\n\nThe strategy was embraced by Garland, Monaco and Wray. They remained committed to it even as evidence emerged of an organized, weeks-long effort by Trump and his advisers before Jan. 6 to pressure state leaders, Justice officials and Vice President Mike Pence to block the certification of Biden’s victory.\n\nIn the weeks before Jan. 6, Trump supporters boasted publicly that they had submitted fake electors on his behalf, but the Justice Department declined to investigate the matter in February 2021, The Post found. The department did not actively probe the effort for nearly a year, and the FBI did not open an investigation of the electors scheme until April 2022, about 15 months after the attack.\n\nThe Justice Department’s painstaking approach to investigating Trump can be traced to Garland’s desire to turn the page from missteps, bruising attacks and allegations of partisanship in the department’s recent investigations of both Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.\n\nInside Justice, however, some lawyers have complained that the attorney general’s determination to steer clear of any claims of political motive has chilled efforts to investigate the former president. “You couldn’t use the T word,” said one former Justice official briefed on prosecutors’ discussions.\n\nThis account is based on internal documents, court files, congressional records, handwritten contemporaneous notes, and interviews with more than two dozen current and former prosecutors, investigators, and others with knowledge of the probe. Most of the people interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal decision-making related to the investigation.\n\nSpokespeople at the Justice Department and FBI declined to comment or make Garland, Monaco or Wray available for interviews.\n\nGarland, 70, whose department includes the FBI, has maintained that DOJ would follow the facts in investigating the attack on the Capitol, starting with “the people on the ground” and working up. In a speech he was heavily involved with writing to mark the first anniversary of the attack, Garland lauded the department’s progress, while also nodding to public scrutiny of the pace of the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In circumstances like those of January 6th, a full accounting does not suddenly materialize,” Garland said. “We follow the facts, not an agenda or an assumption. The facts tell us where to go next.”\n\nAsked about prosecuting Trump, Garland generally has expressed the same sentiment as Sherwin that no one is above the law. The Justice Department will hold accountable anyone “criminally responsible for attempting to interfere with the … lawful transfer of power from one administration to the next,” Garland said in the summer of 2022.\n\nIn an interview with The Post, Matthew M. Graves, who succeeded Sherwin as the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, cautioned against drawing conclusions about the government’s approach while its work is ongoing. He noted that 23 of 29 affiliates and members of the Oath Keepers charged in connection with the attack had been convicted so far, several for seditious conspiracy, the first such convictions since 2009.\n\n“I hear everybody kind of wants everything to go faster,” Graves said. “But I think if you kind of look at this in historical perspective — what the department has been able to achieve — I think when people get some distance from it, it will stand as something unprecedented.”\n\nStill, there were consequences to moving at a slower pace. For many months after the attack, prosecutors did not interview White House aides or other key witnesses, according to authorities and attorneys for some of those who have since been contacted by the special counsel. In that time, communications were put at risk of being lost or deleted and memories left to fade.\n\nPeter Zeidenberg, who helped lead a special counsel probe of the George W. Bush White House, said Garland and Monaco had to tread carefully because investigating a president’s attempts to overturn an election is a novel case, and they did not want to appear partisan. “But you can take it to the extreme … you work so hard not to be a partisan that you’re failing to do your job.”\n\n‘Everybody keeps asking, “Where the hell is the FBI?”’\n\nOutnumbered and desperate to regain control of the Capitol following the Jan. 6 attack, Capitol Police had for the most part let the rioters walk away. The task of identifying the thousands of attackers — let alone building cases against them — fell to a Justice Department whose leadership was in transition.\n\nWilliam P. Barr had left his post as attorney general two weeks before the attack amid a growing rift with Trump. His successor, Jeffrey Rosen, held the office for less than a month, and Garland would not be sworn in until March 11. Biden’s pick to replace Sherwin as the U.S. attorney in D.C. would not take office for another 10 months.\n\nAt the FBI, Trump, over the previous year, had repeatedly threatened to fire Wray, 56, who had in turn tried to keep a low profile. The investigations of Clinton’s email and Russia’s interference in the 2016 election had been run out of FBI headquarters and created firestorms. Since then, Wray and his team sought to avoid even an appearance of top-down influence by having local field offices run investigations and make day-to-day decisions. In fact, when it came to the Jan. 6 investigation, agents noticed that Wray did not travel the five blocks from FBI headquarters to the bureau’s Washington field office running the investigation for more than 21 months after the attack. In that time, people familiar with the investigation said, he had never received a detailed briefing on the topic directly from the assistant director in charge of the office, Steven D’Antuono.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, a key partnership formed on the night of the insurrection between D’Antuono and Sherwin that would set the direction for the early phase of the investigation.\n\nThe two agreed they needed to round up as many Jan. 6 rioters as possible to dissuade extremists from disrupting Biden’s inauguration in two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecuting violent Trump supporters wasn’t the job Sherwin had signed up for. The longtime Miami federal prosecutor and former naval intelligence officer had come to D.C. the previous year on a short-term assignment as a top adviser to Barr on national security matters. Barr then named him in May 2020 to be acting U.S. attorney in Washington, raising concerns that the office — which was then handling multiple investigations of interest to Trump — would continue to be politicized. But Sherwin had experience with domestic extremists, as well as with Trump. In 2018, he had helped track, interrogate and charge a Florida Trump supporter who sent mail bombs to Democratic Party officials and media organizations. The following year, he won the conviction of a Chinese trespasser at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nFor D’Antuono, 51, an unlikely series of past tests now seemed like practice for the glare of Jan. 6, he told colleagues. An accountant by training, he had been promoted to a senior post in the FBI’s St. Louis field office in 2014, just as the police shooting of Michael Brown touched off protests in nearby Ferguson and his office was called to investigate the shooting. D’Antuono then took over the Detroit field office before the pandemic hit. Michigan became a hotbed of lockdown protests, and he oversaw an investigation of militia members accused of plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D). Weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Wray named him head of the D.C. office.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol attack, the FBI began announcing charges that were meant to send a message. Agents arrested the man pictured propping his feet on a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office suite. The next day it was the man in the horned headdress who was known as the “QAnon shaman.” The goal was to “show confidence in the system,” Sherwin told a colleague.\n\nBeyond short written or video statements denouncing the Jan. 6 violence in general, however, neither Wray nor Rosen came out publicly to reinforce that message.\n\nD’Antuono, who was interacting with lawmakers and reporters, told colleagues: “Everybody keeps asking, ‘Where the hell is the FBI?’”\n\nThe answer they heard did not instill confidence. Top FBI aides told D’Antuono and Sherwin that Wray wanted to stay on as Biden’s FBI director. They said they would not put the top boss “out there” — in the public eye — because they feared any public comments might spur Trump to unceremoniously fire him.\n\nPeople close to Rosen and Wray said they preferred to let the local investigators running probes discuss the specifics of their cases.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nKey officials in DOJ’s Jan. 6 investigation\n\nMerrick Garland was confirmed as President Biden’s attorney general on March 10, 2021. He had served for almost 24 years on the federal appeals court in D.C., including seven as its chief judge. President Barack Obama nominated Garland to the Supreme Court in 2016, but his nomination was blocked by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nLisa Monaco was confirmed as deputy attorney general on April 20, 2021. The Justice Department’s No. 2, she previously held senior positions within the department and served as Obama’s adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism. Monaco also previously served as chief of staff to then-FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nChristopher A. Wray has been FBI director since 2017, when then-President Donald Trump nominated him to replace James B. Comey. Wray had previously served as an assistant attorney general in the administration of President George W. Bush. For many years in between, he was in private practice focusing on government investigations and white-collar crime.\n\nMichael R. Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021, was a longtime federal prosecutor in South Florida before he took a post as a counselor to then-Attorney General William P. Barr. Sherwin was in charge of the office responsible for prosecuting Jan. 6-related crimes and stayed on for the first two months of Biden’s presidency.\n\nSteven M. D’Antuono served as assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office from 2020 until late last year. An accountant by training, he previously held supervisory positions in D.C., as well as the bureau’s Detroit and St. Louis field offices. Weeks before the 2020 election, Wray named him head of the D.C. office.\n\nThomas Windom, a prosecutor who joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office in D.C. in the fall of 2021. He was named to a small investigative team looking for connections between the riot and people in Trump’s orbit. He has since joined special counsel Jack Smith’s team.\n\nJ.P. Cooney was chief of the public corruption division in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in D.C. when he proposed investigative steps in February 2021 that were rejected by the FBI and senior DOJ officials. He, too, has joined Smith’s team.\n\nMatthew M. Graves, Biden’s nominee to be U.S. attorney in D.C., was not confirmed by the Senate until Oct. 28, 2021, almost 10 months after the attack. He stood up the team that included Windom, and that began looking at the fake electors scheme.\n\nMatthew G. Olsen, Biden’s nominee to be assistant attorney general for national security, a position important to key charging decisions, was confirmed on the same day as Graves.\n\n1 / 9\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nOn Jan. 12, the Justice Department’s public affairs team informed Sherwin and D’Antuono that they would lead the department’s first live on-camera news conference about the investigation.\n\nThe pair said investigators were prioritizing the arrest of violent actors, whom Sherwin called the “alligators closest to the boat.”\n\nWhen asked whether the department would also investigate Trump’s role in urging supporters to come to Washington and inciting the crowd to march on the Capitol, Sherwin again said Trump was not off-limits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA plan to focus on Trump’s orbit is batted down\n\nBy the end of January, with Biden sworn in as president, the scope of the Jan. 6 investigation was rapidly expanding inside the U.S. attorney’s office. Scores of prosecutors and FBI agents from around the country — most still working remotely because of the pandemic — had been tasked with continuing to identify and charge rioters.\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s office and the FBI had specialized teams probing the death of Capitol Police officer Brian D. Sicknick and the police shooting of rioter Ashli Babbitt. Another team, searching for the person who had planted pipe bombs near the Capitol, had almost 50 FBI agents. A “complex conspiracy” team, a group of 15 prosecutors and agents, zeroed in on members of militia groups who appeared to have coordinated and plotted aspects of the attack, internal briefing documents show.\n\nBut a group of prosecutors led by J.P. Cooney, the head of the fraud and public corruption section at the U.S. attorney’s office, argued that the existing structure of the probe overlooked a key investigative angle. They sought to open a new front, based partly on publicly available evidence, including from social media, that linked some extremists involved in the riot to people in Trump’s orbit — including Roger Stone, Trump’s longest-serving political adviser; Ali Alexander, an organizer of the “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the riot; and Alex Jones, the Infowars host.\n\nIn a decade in the U.S. attorney’s office, Cooney, 46, had gained a reputation as a bold prosecutor who took on big cases. In 2017, he argued the government’s bribery case against Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), which ended in a mistrial and with the Justice Department withdrawing the charges. In 2019, he oversaw the team that convicted Stone on charges of witness tampering and lying to Congress. Cooney signed off on recommending a prison sentence of seven to nine years, but Barr pressed to cut it by more than half after Trump tweeted that it was “horrible and very unfair.” Trump later pardoned Stone.\n\nIn February 2021, Cooney took his proposal to investigate the ties with people in Trump’s orbit directly to a group of senior agents in the FBI’s public corruption division, a group he’d worked with over the years and who were enmeshed in some of the most sensitive Jan. 6 cases underway.\n\nAccording to three people who either viewed or were briefed on Cooney’s plan, it called for a task force to embark on a wide-ranging effort, including seeking phone records for Stone, as well as Alexander. Cooney wanted investigators to follow the money — to trace who had financed the false claims of a stolen election and paid for the travel of rallygoers-turned-rioters. He was urging investigators to probe the connection between Stone and members of the Oath Keepers, who were photographed together outside the Willard hotel in downtown Washington on the morning of Jan. 6.\n\nInside the FBI’s Washington Field Office, agents recognized Cooney’s presentation for the major course change that it presented. Investigators were already looking for evidence that might bubble up from rioter cases to implicate Stone and others. Cooney’s plan would have started agents looking from the top down as well, including directly investigating a senior Trump ally. They alerted D’Antuono to their concerns, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nD’Antuono called Sherwin. The two agreed Cooney did not provide evidence that Stone had likely committed a crime — the standard they considered appropriate for looking at a political figure. Investigating Stone simply because he spent time with Oath Keepers could expose the department to accusations that it had politicized the probe, they told colleagues.\n\nD’Antuono took the matter to Abbate, Wray’s newly named deputy director. Abbate agreed the plan was premature.\n\nSherwin similarly went up his chain of command, alerting Matt Axelrod, one of the senior-most officials Biden installed on his landing team at “Main Justice,” as the DOJ headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue NW is known. Axelrod, a top Justice Department official during the Obama administration, had been tapped by Biden’s transition committee to help run the department day-to-day until Garland and Monaco could be confirmed.\n\nAxelrod called a meeting for the last week of February with Sherwin, D’Antuono, Abbate and other top deputies. Cooney wasn’t there to defend his plan, according to three people familiar with the discussion, but Axelrod and Abbate reacted allergically to one aspect of it: Cooney wanted membership rolls for Oath Keepers as well as groups that had obtained permits for rallies on Jan. 6, looking for possible links and witnesses. The two saw those steps as treading on First Amendment-protected activities, the people said.\n\nAxelrod saw an uncomfortable analogy to Black Lives Matter protests that had ended in vandalism in D.C. and elsewhere a year earlier. “Imagine if we had requested membership lists for BLM” in the middle of the George Floyd protests, he would say later, people said.\n\nAxelrod later told colleagues that he knew Jan. 6 was an unprecedented attack, but he feared deviating from the standard investigative playbook — doing so had landed the DOJ in hot water before. Former FBI director James B. Comey’s controversial decision to break protocol — by publicly announcing he was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s emails days before the 2016 presidential election — was widely viewed as swinging the contest in Trump’s favor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome in the group also acknowledged the political risks during the meeting or in subsequent conversations, according to people familiar with the discussions. Seeking the communications of a high-profile Trump ally such as Stone could trigger a social media post from Trump decrying yet another FBI investigation as a “witch hunt.” And what if the probe turned up nothing? Some were mindful, too, that investigating public figures demanded a high degree of confidence, because even a probe that finds no crime can unfairly impugn them.\n\nAll who assembled for the late February meeting were in agreement, with Axelrod making the final call: Cooney’s plan would not go forward.\n\nAspects of the proposal were reported in 2021 by The Post and the New York Times. But the identity of the prosecutor who pushed for the plan, several of its details and the full story of how it galvanized the Justice Department’s approach to the Jan. 6 investigation have not been previously revealed.\n\nInside the FBI’s Washington Field Office, buzz about who might join the task force to investigate those around Trump dissipated as word spread that plans for the team had been shelved. In the U.S. attorney’s office, budding investigative work around the finances of Trump backers was halted, an internal record shows, including into Jones, who had boasted of paying a half-million dollars for the president’s Jan. 6 rally and claimed the White House had asked him to lead the march to the Capitol.\n\nAbout the same time, attorneys at Main Justice declined another proposal that would have squarely focused prosecutors on documents that Trump used to pressure Pence not to certify the election for Biden, The Post found.\n\nOfficials at the National Archives had discovered similarities in fraudulent slates of electors for Trump that his Republican allies had submitted to Congress and the Archives. The National Archives inspector general’s office asked the Justice Department’s election crimes branch to consider investigating the seemingly coordinated effort in swing states. Citing its prosecutors’ discretion, the department told the Archives it would not pursue the topic, according to two people with knowledge of the decision.\n\nA prosecutor missteps with talk of seditious conspiracy\n\nThe Justice Department didn’t expound at the time on why they turned down the elector probe, but the department made clear its strategy on the riot. Investigators would rely on the traditional method for prosecuting organized crime cases — rolling up of smaller criminals to implicate bigger ones.\n\nTo make it work, however, Sherwin began agitating that the government would need a hammer — a charge that would fit the historic nature of the crime and potentially carry decades in prison — to leverage rioters to tell everything they knew about the planning.\n\nOn Feb. 19, Sherwin signed an indictment charging nine Oath Keepers with conspiring to obstruct a government proceeding. In meetings, he instructed his top deputies to rapidly draft a superseding indictment charging some of them with seditious conspiracy and present it to DOJ headquarters so they could weigh applying this novel charge.\n\nThe Justice Department’s most recent attempt to prosecute using the Civil War-era statute — in accusing militia group members of plotting to kill a police officer and harm others — had resulted in embarrassment when a judge acquitted defendants in 2012.\n\nSherwin, though, had seen the charge as appropriate for Jan. 6 rioters from early on; the main file folder in the U.S. attorney’s office computer system, where line prosecutors shared charging papers and other filings, was named “riots and seditious conspiracy.” Sherwin had begun carrying around a copy of the seditious conspiracy criminal statute, 18 USC 2384: “if two or more persons … conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States,” he would read, shrugging his shoulders as though it was obvious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSherwin had announced he would step down, making way for Biden to nominate a new U.S. attorney, but he felt so strongly about the seditious conspiracy approach that it figured into his briefing for the new attorney general on Garland’s first day on the job.\n\nSherwin emphasized that most of the rioters were “stand-alone” actors who got caught up in the mob mentality. He said he was worried prosecutors risked getting bogged down trying hundreds of defendants and recommended the government plead out hundreds of lesser Jan. 6 cases. He stressed that the department should focus on the planners and leaders of the attack and consider using the little-used charge of attempting to violently overthrow their government.\n\nGarland thanked Sherwin but did not reveal his thinking on seditious conspiracy, according to two people familiar with the meeting. It would become the norm in Garland’s buttoned-down Justice Department to share information on only a need-to-know basis.\n\nAddressing staff on his first day, Garland made clear he expected the department to speak through its conduct and court filings. “We will show the American people by word and deed that the Department of Justice pursues equal justice and adheres to the rule of law,” he said.\n\nGarland began arriving at the office each day before 8:30 a.m. and staying until after 7 p.m. When it came to charging decisions, even senior members of his team wouldn’t be read in unless they had an operational reason to be involved. But just 10 days in, his pursuit of a drama-free tenure faced a jolt.\n\nBefore returning to Miami, Sherwin agreed to tape an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes.”\n\nSherwin suggested to CBS that investigators had obtained enough evidence to prove some rioters engaged in sedition. “I personally believe the evidence is trending toward that, and probably meets those elements,” he said.\n\nAmit Mehta, the federal judge overseeing the prosecution of several members of the Oath Keepers involved in the Jan. 6 attack, watched Sherwin’s March 21, 2021, interview.\n\nOn six hours’ notice, he called a video hearing with lawyers on the Oath Keepers’ case and said he was more than a little “surprised” to see Sherwin publicly forecasting future charges on a nationally televised broadcast.\n\n“Whether his interview violated Justice Department policy is really not for me to say, but it is something I hope the Department of Justice is looking into,” Mehta said.\n\nGarland’s top deputies were livid, and the attorney general himself was visibly upset, several people familiar with his reaction said. The attorney general, who was painstaking in preparing his own public remarks, was especially angry at Sherwin for speaking off the cuff. In the hearing with Mehta, John Crabb, chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney’s office, said it appeared that “rules and procedures were not complied with” regarding the television interview, and that Sherwin had been referred to the department’s internal affairs office for an ethics probe. Sherwin later told people he thought he’d had the department’s support to tape the interview.\n\nSherwin heard from a close Justice Department ally that Garland and his deputies now felt boxed into the seditious conspiracy charges — or to tough questions if they didn’t bring them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ‘bottom-up’ approach faces internal roadblocks\n\nAs the six-month mark from the attack passed, several prosecutors felt increasingly overwhelmed by the growing workload and the extended wait for a permanent U.S. attorney. Prosecutors had begun recommending plea deals for dozens of Jan. 6 defendants but told colleagues weeks would pass without decisions from superiors.\n\nTaking Sherwin’s place until Biden’s nominee could be named and confirmed was Channing D. Phillips, 65, who had twice served as the U.S. attorney in D.C. Phillips expressed to people that he saw his role as a placeholder with limited power to make decisions about Jan. 6 cases.\n\nA permanent replacement was slow in coming, leaving some prosecutors describing the investigation as “rudderless” throughout the summer of 2021. Near the end of July, Biden nominated Graves, a lawyer in private practice who had once led the office’s fraud section.\n\nDuring that time, Justice officials continued to have conflicting views over whether to pursue people in Trump’s orbit. The debate reached the deputy attorney general’s office.\n\nMonaco, 55, had begun her career as a staffer in Biden’s Senate Judiciary Committee, and had herself worked as a federal prosecutor in the D.C. office. Monaco later rose to be the chief of staff to FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III and subsequently was President Barack Obama’s homeland security adviser. By design, conflicts that arise between the U.S. attorney’s office, the FBI or other branches of the Justice Department are managed by the deputy attorney general’s office.\n\nMonaco warned her aides that the department could not begin probing political actors linked to Trump based on assumptions, according to two individuals familiar with the discussions.\n\n“A decision was made early on to focus DOJ resources on the riot,” said one former Justice Department official familiar with the debates. “The notion of opening up on Trump and high-level political operatives was seen as fraught with peril. When Lisa and Garland came on board, they were fully onboard with that approach.”\n\nSome prosecutors even had the impression that Trump had become a taboo topic at Main Justice. Colleagues responsible for preparing briefing materials and updates for Garland and Monaco were warned to focus on foot soldiers and to avoid mentioning Trump or his close allies.\n\nLate that summer, members of the team leading one of the most high-profile parts of the bottom-up probe into members of the Oath Keepers became frustrated, according to people familiar with the investigation.\n\nProsecutors wanted to charge Stewart Rhodes, the group’s founder, and several lieutenants with seditious conspiracy. But by fall, the decision remained in limbo. Prosecutors had put Rhodes in their sights since February, when they first referred to him as “Person One” in court records, but still hadn’t arrested him.\n\n“The agents kept asking, ‘What’s going on?’” recalled one of those familiar with the case. “They were ready to pick up Rhodes.”\n\nWhile FBI agents and line prosecutors wanted to move forward with the charge, a decision was delayed in part because of wariness and debate among some officials inside Monaco’s and Garland’s offices about the risk of sedition charges being overturned on appeal. On top of that, the department still lacked Senate confirmation for two of Biden’s nominees — for U.S. attorney in D.C. and an assistant attorney general for national security, the key supervisors over the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘At some point, there was no ladder from here to there’\n\nBy fall, some of Biden’s Justice Department nominees began to finally win Senate confirmation.\n\nOn Nov. 1, 2021, Matthew G. Olsen was sworn in as assistant attorney general for national security. He was returning to an office he helped build from scratch two decades earlier in the Bush administration, in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nFour days later, Graves, 47, was sworn in as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. With that, 10 months after the attack on the Capitol, Garland finally had a permanent team of chief prosecutors in place to guide the investigation.\n\nOlsen, 61, pressed to take on a role in the Jan. 6 casework, which had been led until then by the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office, according to people familiar with the offices at the time. He argued to senior Justice Department officials that an effort to block the peaceful transfer of power was squarely in the vein of what the national security division should be focused on. Monaco agreed. By mid-November, both Olsen and Graves were sitting with D’Antuono, receiving an exhaustive briefing on the state of the Jan. 6 investigations.\n\nThe outstanding issue of whether to charge Rhodes and other militia leaders with seditious conspiracy quickly rose to the top of to-do lists for the two new appointees. It had been eight months since Sherwin directed his deputies to raise the idea in a memo to the office of the deputy attorney general.\n\nSince then, with successive new indictments, the government’s evidence had grown stronger.\n\nGraves and Olsen agreed seditious conspiracy charges “fit like a glove” for the alleged criminal acts of Rhodes and key deputies, one individual briefed on the discussion said, but they disagreed on how many people to charge. Olsen urged they charge a smaller number for whom the evidence was stronger.\n\nBut investigators were beginning to doubt whether such charges would implicate anyone higher than Rhodes. The bottom-up approach that had dominated nearly a year of the government’s time had not yielded any significant connection to Trump’s orbit.\n\n“It had become clear that the odds were very low that ‘bottom-up’ was ever going to get very high,” said one of those individuals. “At some point, there was no ladder from here to there.”\n\nIn the meantime, public knowledge of the actions in the White House that precipitated Jan. 6 was building rapidly. A book by The Post’s Bob Woodward and Robert Costa detailed a memo by Trump legal adviser John Eastman purporting to show a legal basis for Pence to block the certification of Biden’s win on Jan. 6. It called for the vice president to rely on fake slates of electors for Trump from seven states to declare that the election outcome was in dispute. A separate Post story also revealed numerous details of a “war room” that Trump’s closest advisers had been running out of the Willard hotel. The president’s backers used the space as a hub to push members of state legislatures to take steps to support Eastman’s plan, and to urge Pence not to certify the results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘I’m not serving subpoenas on the friggin’ Willard’\n\nInside the U.S. attorney’s office and at Main Justice, prosecutors noticed the developments and grew troubled that the office was still putting too few resources into probing evidence of a broad, Trump-led conspiracy to overturn the election.\n\nSoon after Graves arrived, prosecutors had highlighted the challenges of preparing for rioter trials while also reviewing thousands of hours of video and other digital data for evidence of other crimes.\n\nGraves relayed to Monaco’s office that he planned to stand up a new investigative unit, marking the government’s first major pivot to look beyond the riots. It would be charged with pulling together strands of evidence that investigators had obtained from various rioter cases, including leads on the effort to block the certification.\n\nThe office was stretched thin, but among the many documents awaiting Graves’s review when he arrived was one that would transfer a little-known Maryland federal prosecutor to his office.\n\nThomas Windom, 45, who had won plaudits for investigating a domestic extremist group called “The Base,” had appealed to higher-ups for a move. The deputy attorney general’s office saw the U.S. attorney’s office in D.C. as being in need of help.\n\nGraves put Windom on the new investigations team.\n\nWith Graves’s support, Windom soon approached the FBI’s Washington Field Office for additional help.\n\nAt a meeting in November 2021, Windom asked D’Antuono to assist in a grand jury investigation, which would include subpoenaing the Willard hotel for billing information from the time when Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani was working with Stephen K. Bannon, Boris Epshteyn and other Trump associates in their “war room.” Stone was staying there around Jan. 6 as well, in a different suite.\n\nD’Antuono was skeptical. The investigative track sounded eerily similar to the Cooney proposal that had been shot down in February, he later confided to colleagues.\n\n“I’m not serving subpoenas on the friggin’ Willard,” D’Antuono told Windom, according to a person familiar with their discussions. “You don’t have enough to issue subpoenas.”\n\nWindom seemed surprised at the flat rejection, according to people familiar with the meeting. D’Antuono offered instead to give Windom full access to the FBI’s trove of evidence about Oath Keeper and Proud Boy extremists involved in the riot. Maybe Windom would find a communication or financial link between rioters and Trump deputies, D’Antuono suggested. The two also briefly discussed fake electors, but the FBI wasn’t ready to move forward on that topic either. Windom thanked him and left.\n\nIn the next several weeks, Windom would turn to consider the fake electors and discreetly inquire if another agency might help: the U.S. Postal Service inspector.\n\nAt the same time, Graves’s and Olsen’s debate over who to charge with sedition stretched into December, and a growing chorus of former public officials, lawmakers and others criticized Garland for what they saw as a lack of progress on the events that ignited the attack and the roles of Trump and his allies. In one of several examples, three former military generals warned in The Post that the country had to prepare for the next insurrection after not a single leader who incited the violence had been held to account, and they pressed the Justice Department to “show more urgency.”\n\nThat fall and winter, a House committee pursuing its own investigation into Jan. 6 conducted interviews with top Trump administration officials. Privately, its chief investigator, Timothy Heaphy, a former U.S. attorney, had alerted prosecutors in the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office to a few details his team had uncovered about Trump’s pressure on Justice Department officials and Pence to block the election results, according to a person familiar with the exchanges. But eye-grabbing news accounts about the committee’s discoveries fueled public criticism that the Justice Department appeared to be lagging.\n\nIn late December, amid that wave of criticism, Olsen briefed the attorney general that he had reached a decision on the sedition question: Rhodes and 10 other Oath Keepers would face that rarely brought charge.\n\nGarland had gotten deep into the weeds on the charge in previous briefings, cracking open his statute book and asking numerous questions about the risks of it being overturned. Monaco told the attorney general that Olsen’s team had done a good job stress-testing the case.\n\nDays later, Garland delivered a speech on the eve of the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack. One line stood out as a promise to his critics: “The actions we have taken thus far will not be our last.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI investigation is opened\n\nOn Jan. 13, 2022, the department indicted Rhodes and 10 other Oath Keepers on charges of seditious conspiracy. It did not quiet the criticism, but instead put a spotlight on signs the Justice Department was not, in comparison with the House committee, working as actively to investigate Trump’s role in the attempted coup.\n\nPolitico had reported that week that the House committee had demanded and received documents from several states about fake electors as well as other efforts Trump advisers had taken to pressure state officials ahead of Jan. 6. A wave of news reports and commentary followed, including by MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, who devoted several nights of her show to reporting on clues that suggested Trump allies ran a coordinated scheme to try to overturn the election.\n\nIn the last of those episodes, on Jan. 13, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) announced that she had referred the matter of fake electors to federal prosecutors — that day. She called the scheme “forgery of a public record” under Michigan law but said the Justice Department would be best suited to prosecute a multistate effort.\n\nAbout two weeks later, on Jan. 25, Monaco was asked during a televised interview about indications that the fake electors scheme had been coordinated by Trump allies. Monaco hinted there was an investigation underway.\n\n“We’ve received those referrals,” Monaco said on CNN. “Our prosecutors are looking at those. I can’t say anything more on ongoing investigations.”\n\nLaw enforcement officers, including some who would be called upon to join the investigation in ensuing months, were taken aback by Monaco’s comments because they had not been told work was beginning, and it was extremely rare for Justice Department officials to comment on ongoing investigations.\n\nBehind the scenes, federal prosecutors in Michigan who received Nessel’s referral were waiting to hear from Monaco’s office about how Main Justice wanted to proceed. National Archives officials were dumbstruck; the Justice Department was suddenly interested in the fake electors evidence it had declined to pursue a year earlier.\n\nOne person directly familiar with the department’s new interest in the case said it felt as though the department was reacting to the House committee’s work as well as heightened media coverage and commentary. “Only after they were embarrassed did they start looking,” the person said.\n\nWhen D’Antuono saw Monaco’s comments, he turned to his deputies and offered a prediction: He would get a call soon from prosecutors asking him to begin investigating electors.\n\nWithin a few weeks, prosecutors from the U.S. attorney’s office were again in a meeting with D’Antuono. This time, they did not attempt to link the electors scheme to violence on Jan. 6 but presented it as worthy of its own investigation. D’Antuono told colleagues he saw a path for opening a full investigation, as there was evidence of a potential crime — mail fraud: Documents that appeared fraudulent had been submitted through the mail to the National Archives and signed by people the FBI could trace.\n\nD’Antuono agreed to run the FBI’s multistate investigation.\n\nThe process did not go quickly. Lawyers at the FBI and Justice Department launched into what became many weeks of debate over the justification for the investigation and how it should be worded; one time-consuming issue became whether to name Trump as a subject.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the FBI investigation still not opened, late in March a federal judge presiding over a civil case made a startling ruling: Trump “more likely than not” committed federal crimes in trying to obstruct the congressional count of electoral college votes.\n\nThe determination from U.S. District Judge David O. Carter came in a ruling addressing scores of sensitive emails that Eastman had resisted turning over to the House select committee. After reviewing the documents privately, Carter wrote that the actions by Trump and Eastman amounted to “a coup in search of a legal theory” and that “the illegality of the plan was obvious.”\n\nCarter, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, took the opportunity to express frustration with the pace of the criminal investigation.\n\n“More than a year after the attack on our Capitol, the public is still searching for accountability. … If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself.”\n\nIn April 2022, more than 15 months after the attack, Wray signed off on the authorization opening a criminal investigation into the fake electors plot.\n\nStill, the FBI was tentative: Internally, some of the ex-president’s advisers and his reelection campaign were identified as the focus of the bureau’s probe, but not Trump.\n\nStarting from behind\n\nOn June 21, 2022, the House select committee held a nationally televised hearing on fake electors — a topic the committee had, in contrast to the Justice Department, identified early on as a major target for investigation. Testimony revealed what the committee had learned in nine months: The Trump campaign had requested that fake elector documents be flown to D.C. in time to help pressure Pence. The Republican speaker of the Arizona House, Russell “Rusty” Bowers, hushed the chamber, saying Giuliani had contacted him to try to remove Biden’s electors in his state. “He pressed that point, and I said, ‘Look, you are asking me to do something that is counter to my oath,’” Bowers said.\n\nThat day, FBI agents delivered subpoenas about electors for Trump to state lawmakers in Arizona. The next day, agents served subpoenas to people who signed documents claiming to be Trump electors in Georgia and Michigan.\n\nNear the end of July, the Justice Department investigation into Trump’s orbit gained new speed.\n\nGraves decided the investigation was becoming too big to operate without a supervisor. The U.S. attorney turned to Cooney, the chief of the public corruption division who had sought to push investigators to begin looking at people in Trump’s orbit almost a year and a half earlier. In an office-wide email on July 28, Graves was vague about Cooney’s new role, saying he was leaving his post to help with “investigatory efforts” related to Jan. 6.\n\nOver the next three months, subpoenas to former Trump campaign and White House officials sought information not only on fake electors but also on Trump’s post-presidential fundraising efforts, hinting at how wide-ranging the investigation had become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, on Nov. 18, Garland abruptly summoned to Main Justice the D.C.-based prosecutors working on the Jan. 6 conspiracy as well as those who had already gathered extensive evidence of Trump concealing classified records at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The attorney general told them that to ensure the appearance of independence into the two probes of a potential Biden rival, he would appoint a special counsel later that day. While the prosecutors could choose their next steps, Garland said he hoped they would continue the work under Smith.\n\nCooney, who had worked with Smith almost a decade earlier, as well as Windom and roughly 20 others, signed on.\n\nA new chief prosecutor would typically need weeks or months to get up to speed on a high-priority investigation. But Smith issued subpoenas in the Jan. 6 probe after just four days, picking up where the U.S. attorney’s office had left off, seeking communications between officials in three swing states and Trump, his campaign, and 19 advisers and attorneys who had worked to keep him in power.\n\nSmith’s office kept up a steady pace. Prosecutors issued flurries of subpoenas, including demands for records relating to Trump political action committees and his fundraising pitches around supposed election fraud. Smith’s prosecutors also summoned a stream of witnesses for preliminary interviews and testimony before a D.C. grand jury.\n\nIn several cases, before the special counsel’s office got in touch, witnesses in the fake electors scheme hadn’t heard from the FBI in almost a year and thought the case was dead. Similarly, firsthand witnesses to Trump’s Jan. 2, 2021, call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — in which Trump asked him to “find” enough votes to win that state — were not interviewed by the Justice Department until this year, after Smith’s team contacted them.\n\nIn late May, members of Trump’s legal team began bracing for Smith to bring charges in his other line of investigation. On June 8, a grand jury in Miami endorsed Smith’s evidence that Trump kept and withheld top-secret documents, indicting Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, as Trump pleaded not guilty to those charges in federal court in Miami, Smith’s investigation into efforts to steal the election continued: Michael McDonald and Jim DeGraffenreid, the chairman and vice chairman of the Nevada Republican Party who had signed a document claiming to be electors for Trump, entered the area of the D.C. federal courthouse where a grand jury has been meeting on cases related to Jan. 6.\n\ncorrection\n\nA previous version of this story incorrectly described the case in Michigan when the Justice Department most recently sought to bring a charge of seditious conspiracy against members of a militia group. The case involved the 2012 acquittal of members of the Hutaree nationalist group. This version has been updated.\n\nSpencer S.

In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}}",94.91666666666667,3

All nine cases. Can a fundraising grift be far behind?\n\nAt long last, that hallowed day has arrived. This historic moment when Arizona’s conspiracy crowd can rise, with one voice, and proclaim, “aHA!”\n\nYes, it seems that Arizona’s elusive election fraud has finally been uncovered.\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party was jubilant at the news, delivered in Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s interim report on the findings of the Maricopa County election audit.\n\n“BREAKING NEWS: Arizona Audit w/ @KelliWardAZ. AG @GeneralBrnovich has determined widespread FRAUD in the Maricopa County 2020 election,” the Arizona Republican Party breathlessly reported.\n\nState GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward was practically orgasmic.\n\n“Perp walks & prosecutions on the way! #ElectionIntegrity,” she tweeted.\n\nWard even made a video about it (with a fundraising plea, no doubt, still to come).\n\n“The report says the Election Integrity Unit review has uncovered instances of election fraud,” Ward reported to the party faithful. “Yes, election fraud by individuals who have been or will be prosecuted for various election crimes... Wow. That’s big. The words fraud and prosecuted are finally being used.”\n\nWidespread election fraud = 9 cases in 3.4 million votes\n\nWow is right.\n\nEspecially if you read the footnote accompanying the 12-page report\'s lone sentence about election fraud – the one that references a report on all the fraud that Brnovich’s Elections Integrity Unit has uncovered in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAll nine cases.\n\nThere are the six felons who somehow allegedly managed to vote while in Pima County jail.\n\nAnd there are three women who returned their recently deceased mothers’ early ballots. Two of them live in Maricopa County, one in Cochise County.\n\nSo. Nine cases of election fraud. Out of 3.4 million votes cast.\n\nSomething’s widespread, all right, and rather fragrant, as well. But it isn’t fraud.\n\nWithin hours of Brnovich\'s report, Republican legislative hopeful Steve Zipperman had already pumped out a fundraising plea.\n\n""Attorney General Brnovich has released a letter to Senator Fann (click below for full text), declaring that there WAS “Election Fraud” in the 2020 election...,"" wrote Zipperman, one of three Republicans hoping to replace Sen. Karen Fann. ""As the ONLY Arizona Senate Candidate for LD-1 who declared that there WAS Election Fraud in 2020, Steve was attacked for his conviction. Steve’s insight, courage, and motivation to restore voter confidence in Arizona is essential.""\n\nNo word on Steve\'s ability to read a footnote.\n\nOr maybe he intentionally omitted the fact that we are talking about nine whole cases of election fraud.\n\nNot even Brnovich – the Senate candidate who is slipping in the polls and desperately chasing Donald Trump’s endorsement – could bring himself to claim Arizona\'s election was stolen, though he came as close as he possibly could. (Which is to say, not close at all).\n\nHe claimed there are “serious vulnerabilities” in Arizona’s electoral system, but he couldn’t point to a single instance of a phony vote as a result.\n\nThe only \'vulnerability\' is Brnovich\'s Senate campaign\n\nThe only truly serious vulnerability here is Brnovich’s Senate campaign prospects, which is why I suspect that the attorney general who in 2020 had no problem with Arizona’s election now suddenly ... does.\n\nIn November 2020, as politicians all around him were diving for cover, Brnovich went on national TV to proclaim that there was simply no evidence that Donald Trump was robbed in Arizona. Then he went on to certify the election.\n\n“It came down to: People split their ticket,” he told Fox Business’ Neil Cavuto. “People voted for Republicans down ballot, and they didn’t vote for President Trump or Martha McSally. So, that’s the reality.”\n\nAnd yet here is Brnovich now, when there still is no evidence that Donald Trump was robbed.\n\n“It is frustrating. It’s frustrating to all of us,"" he said on Steve Bannon\'s podcast on Thursday. ""Because I think we all know what happened in 2020,” he told Bannon. “I assure you Steve, I understand how serious this is. I understand why people are frustrated.”\n\nMore frustrating still is what is happening in 2022.\n\nReach Roberts at laurie.roberts@arizonarepublic.com.

The subpoena demanded access to all 2.1 million ballots, the machines that counted them and troves of digital election data from Maricopa County, home to the Phoenix metro area and 60% of Arizona voters.\n\nTo lead the review, Republican lawmakers hired Cyber Ninjas, a small cybersecurity consultancy with no experience in elections and led by a Trump supporter who shared conspiracy theories about the election on a Twitter account that he later deleted.\n\nWhat was the result of the review?\n\nThe review ended in September 2021 without producing proof to support former President Donald Trump’s claims of a stolen election.\n\nThe Cyber Ninjas report confirmed Biden’s narrow victory in Maricopa County but claimed a number of shortcomings in election procedures and suggested the final tally still could not be relied upon. Trump has repeatedly pointed to those claims in his rallies and public statements.\n\nCyber Ninjas and other contractors alleged that election computers were connected to the internet, that there were tens of thousands of potentially illegally cast ballots and that the county purged computer files that could contain evidence of fraud.\n\nWhat did Maricopa County officials say in their rebuttal?\n\nThe detailed response presented in a public meeting of the county Board of Supervisors on Jan. 5 rebutted virtually all the claims made by contractors hired by the state Senate to review its election procedures, equipment, voter registration rolls and ballot tabulation.\n\nThe report said that after ""an in-depth analysis and review of the reports and presentations issued by the Senate’s contractors, we determined that nearly every finding included faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions, and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws.""\n\nSpecifically, Maricopa County officials say of the claims made by the various entities connected to the audit:\n\n22 were found to be misleading. ""The claims lead the reader to assume a conclusion that is not supported by the evidence,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n41 were found to be inaccurate. ""The claims include flawed or misstated analysis,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n13 were found to be false. ""The claims are demonstrably false and can be proven false using materials provided to the Senate,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n""If you are biased or not using an objective process, you’re likely to come to a faulty conclusion,"" said Scott Jarrett, director of the county Elections Department.\n\nDid the county find issues when they analyzed the State Senate report?\n\nThe county experts did find some issues when they analyzed claims in the Senate report. The county review validated only a handful of the 33,000 ballots that the Senate report said could have been illegally cast because voters had moved prior to the election.\n\nFive voters were identified as having voted in more than one county, and six people may have voted twice in Maricopa County. The county report also found 27 cases where ballots were counted that were cast by people who died before they were returned in the mail; those were referred to the state attorney general for more investigation and possible prosecution.\n\nThe county is reviewing another 100 cases involving people who died close to the election but still cast ballots. The Senate report had identified 298 voters who had potentially cast a ballot but died before the election.\n\nIn all, the county found 38 instances were a ballot may have been illegally cast, and all have been sent to the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe county report also said that election workers had inadvertently double counted a batch of 50 ballots.\n\nCould the findings affect the 2020 election results?\n\nThe number of vote counting errors and potential illegal votes would not have affected the outcome of the election. President Joe Biden won Maricopa County by about 45,000 votes, key to his 10,500-vote win of Arizona. Previous reviews of the 2.1 million county ballots by nonpartisan professionals that followed state law have found no significant problem with the vote count in the county, which includes metro Phoenix.\n\nDid the county conduct its own audit?\n\nYes, according to officials.\n\n""After the November 2020 General Election, the County hired two federally certified Voting System Test Laboratories to conduct an audit of the tabulation equipment used to count ballots for all five of the elections administered in 2020,"" read a portion of the report.\n\nAccording to the report, both labs found no anomalies in the tabulation equipment. They also found that:\n\nCertified software were used for all tested software, systems and equipment\n\nNo malware or malicious hardware were installed\n\nNo evidence of internet connectivity was found\n\nOne of the two labs also found the 2020 General Election program and tabulation equipment was accurate, according to county officials.

Warren Petersen, who heads the judiciary committee, were telling Doug Logan and others involved in the ""audit.""\n\nLogan heads Cyber Ninjas, the inexperienced firm the Senate hired to oversee the audit of computers and ballot counting machines and recount by hand 2.1 million ballots cast in 2020′s election in Maricopa County.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s win led former President Donald Trump to allege without evidence that he lost in Arizona and other battleground states because of fraud. The Senate then launched the review, which found the ballot count results were true.\n\nLogan’s report did raise a series of other claims about potential problems with the election, most since disproven. They include the potential for election equipment to be connected to the internet or that large numbers of ballots were cast by dead voters.\n\nThe ruling written by Justice John Lopez says legislative privilege applies because the audit was part of an investigation that could conceivably lead to new election laws. That is enough to shield the approximately 1,000 emails, text messages and other communications the Senate refused to release.\n\n""The Audit is a legislative activity within the legislature’s authority, and communications concerning this activity are covered by legislative privilege,"" Lopez wrote. ""Consequently, the Senate’s internal communications concerning the authorization, planning, and findings of the Audit investigation are privileged.""\n\nContinuing Coverage: Arizona Election Audit\n\nThe ruling overturns both a trial court judge and the state court of appeals, which took narrow views of legislative privilege and held that the public had a right to know what senators discussed about the audit.\n\n""It’s a win for the Senate on every issue unanimously,"" said Kory Langhofer, the Senate’s lawyer. ""It couldn’t be a better ruling.""\n\nThe Senate will have to reveal any records that are political in nature or involve the administration of the audit itself, but the Senate had already agreed to do that.\n\nFann said in a statement that the Senate’s position that the records could be kept secret was supported by ""decades of precedent"" from state and federal courts.\n\n""We absolutely believe in transparency, however, there are times when legislative privilege should be exercised so that we can do the jobs that the people of Arizona elected us to carry out,"" Fann said.\n\nThe public records lawsuit the court decided was filed by a watchdog group called American Oversight, which pushes for government transparency, shortly after the audit was launched in spring 2021.\n\nThe Senate disclosed more than 20,000 records after court orders prompted by lawsuits filed by American Oversight and the Arizona Republic, orders that the Supreme Court refused to block last year. But it withheld all or part of about 1,000 other documents, citing legislative privilege meant to promote robust debate among elected officials.\n\nThe court of appeals said privilege did not apply because the audit was mainly political, no legislation was being considered and the Senate failed to show releasing the documents would impair its deliberations. The Supreme Court rejected those findings, which American Oversight said will keep important information hidden from public view.\n\n""While legislative privilege should protect legitimate functions of the legislature, extending the privilege to activities that the Court recognized as uniquely politicized is misguided,"" American Oversight Executive Director Heather Sawyer said in a statement.

You can’t talk about any other spending when you have 18 — 20 million dollar deficit,” said Supervisor Travis Lingenfelter, a Republican, before voting against a proposal to hand count all the ballots in 2024. “That’s irresponsible.”\n\nSome conservatives, including allies of former President Donald Trump, have pushed hand-counting ballots as a way to ensure the accuracy of election results. But Mohave County\'s experience punctures that talking point, showing that hand-counting is typically expensive, inaccurate and impractical.\n\nIn short, hand-counting ballots isn’t as easy as it sounds.\n\nMohave County, home to an estimated 220,000 people in the northwestern corner of Arizona, is one of a handful of U.S. counties that has considered hand-counting ballots, thanks in part to election conspiracy theories that have driven distrust in ballot tabulators.\n\nAfter the 2020 election, the Arizona state Senate authorized a controversial hand-count audit of two races. The audit took months and cost millions, and — by its leadership’s own account in text messages obtained by The Arizona Republic — failed to result in an accurate count.\n\nBut that hasn’t quelled interest in Arizona. Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a measure authorizing hand counts, which was vetoed by Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs.\n\nIn June, the Mohave County’s Board of Supervisors asked the county elections office to develop a plan for tabulating 2024 results by hand. Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, warned Mohave’s county supervisors in a June letter that they risked breaking the law if they chose to opt for hand-counting in a future election. A lawyer for the county told supervisors before they voted that the county’s legal team wasn’t sure it was legal, either.\n\nThe test run took place in late June, when elections workers spent three days hand-counting a batch of 850 test ballots from the 2022 election, bringing in seven part-time staffers eight-hour days of counting and four full-time staffers who monitored the process.\n\nElections Director Allen Tempert told the Board of Supervisors at a Tuesday meeting that the group was a “dream team” of experienced staffers, but the feasibility study nonetheless went poorly.\n\nThere were counting errors in 46 of 30,600 races on the ballots, as the team tallying the results of the election made mistakes. According to a report prepared for the Board of Supervisors, some of the observed errors included: bored and tired staffers who stopped watching the process, messy handwriting in tallies, fast talkers, or staffers who heard or said the wrong candidate’s name.\n\nEach ballot took three minutes to count, Tempert said. At that pace, it would take a group of seven staffers at least 657 eight-hour days to count 105,000 ballots, the number of ballots cast in 2020. Mohave County would need to hire at least 245 people to tally results and have counting take place seven days a week, including holidays, for nearly three weeks. That estimate doesn’t include the time needed for reconciling mistakes, or counting write-in ballots, Tempert’s report added.\n\nTempert forcefully recommended waiting until Election Day to conduct the hand-count, because he feared results would leak out otherwise. But doing so would leave the county in a time crunch, too: The county would have just 19 days after the election to tally up the ballots, in accordance with state law on canvassing results.\n\nThe total cost for the staffing, renting for a large venue for the counting, security cameras, and other associated costs was staggering: $1,108,486.\n\n“That’s larger than my budget for the whole year, to run the whole election for the whole year!” Tempert said.\n\nGowri Ramachandran, an elections expert and attorney from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, said the experiment was notable.\n\n“There actually hasn’t been a lot of experimentation with hands counting full ballots — meaning all the contests on a ballot in a jurisdiction where you have a lot of contests on the ballot,” she said. Ballots had, on average, 36 races each in the test, according to the report.\n\nBut Ramachandran said the cost and time it takes to conduct audits and recounts made the results predictable.\n\n“When you put those experiences together,"" she said, ""it’s extremely unsurprising what they found in Mohave County.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2023/06/12/new-cyber-ninjas-text-2021-arizona-audit/70299020007/', 'Headline': ""Why what happened in 2021 Arizona election 'audit' still matters"", 'Snippet': 'The truth behind the Arizona Senate\'s ""audit"" of 2020 election results is emerging in thousands of private text messages from Cyber Ninjas\' CEO Doug Logan.', 'Full_text': 'The truth behind the Arizona Senate\'s ""audit"" of 2020 election results is emerging in thousands of private text messages from Cyber Ninjas\' CEO Doug Logan.\n\nThe texts undermine claims the ""audit"" was a nonpartisan effort to ensure the accuracy of election results, revealing it was part of a multi-state effort by allies of former President Donald Trump to restore him to office.\n\nLogan\'s messages show the work of hundreds of volunteers − who spent two months in 2021 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum reviewing ballots and recording individual votes onto more than 70,000 tally sheets − couldn\'t even be counted.\n\nHere\'s the latest on Logan, his texts and the review of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County.\n\nWhat was reason behind the Arizona \'audit\'?\n\nSenate Republicans in 2021 announced they would commission a hand count of every ballot cast in Maricopa County to address claims the election had been stolen from Trump. The Senate subpoenaed the ballots and other election material from the county.\n\nSenate President Karen Fann hired the Cyber Ninjas to lead the hand count. Although neither Logan nor his company had election auditing experience, Fann at the time said he was ""well qualified"" and ""well experienced."" The review was supposed to take a few weeks and cost taxpayers $150,000.\n\nIt would take about two months and cost Arizona millions of dollars.\n\nWhat \'findings\' did Cyber Ninjas report to the Senate?\n\nLogan announced the results of the hand count on Sept. 24, 2021. He reported Joe Biden won the presidential election in Arizona. Logan\'s tally differed from the county\'s official results by 994 votes.\n\nLogan\'s report skimmed over Biden\'s win and raised a host of ""anomalies"" that continued to raise doubts about the election process. It left lawmakers, partisan contractors and Trump allies calling for more audits, the rejection of voting machines and new voter integrity laws to prevent fraud at the polls.\n\nFull story: \'Our numbers are screwy\': Cyber Ninjas CEO admits he couldn\'t tally hand count of ballots\n\nDo Logan\'s private texts contradict his public statements?\n\nYes. In hundreds of recently released texts from the summer of 2021, Logan admitted he couldn\'t make sense of his own data. Days after the hand count ended, Logan confirmed he had no way to tally the results.\n\n""How plausible is this solution looking? I looped back to look through all of the aggregation data again. It (is) pretty broken. A lot of it doesn\'t make any sense,"" Logan wrote in a July 5, 2021, text.\n\nDid Logan say, \'Our numbers are screwy?\'\n\nHe did. Even after he turned over his numbers to Arizona Senate Republicans ― 11 days before the Senate hearing ― Logan was trying to reconcile his own data, with no success.\n\n""Reading through that summary doc on President vs. Senate. Looks like basically our numbers are screwy,"" he said in a Sept. 13 text message.\n\nWhat is Logan\'s response to this?\n\nHe has not responded to repeated interview requests from The Arizona Republic. He has declined to answer specific questions about his text messages or his activities.\n\nHow did the Cyber Ninjas fix the numbers problem?\n\nTexts show they didn\'t. For weeks, Logan tried unsuccessfully to tally more than 70,000 sheets where volunteers recorded individual votes with tick marks. He worked with a technology expert named Mike Piehota, but they couldn\'t come up with a computer system to read the marks.\n\n""To cut to the chase, it\'s my opinion we\'re not going to be able to accurately process tally sheets using current text recognition technology,"" Piehota wrote in a July 6 text. ""Ultimately, we need to consider a different approach if you want to revisit tally sheets in the short term. Other than a massive manual effort, I don\'t have a good answer.""\n\nLogan replied minutes later: ""I don\'t care if we have to hand-write in the batch number, etc. As long as the tally is correct most of the time.""\n\nDid Cyber Ninjas make up numbers?\n\nLogan\'s texts show how his team shifted away from trying to quantify the hand count and sought other means to deliver plausible numbers to the Senate.\n\nThey first tried counting votes by scanning tally sheets. They couldn\'t get a software program to read the tick marks. Then they focused on counting the total number of ballots, scouring county electronic tabulation records, creating worksheets and databases and weighing ballot boxes on scales.\n\nThe texts indicate they failed at these efforts.\n\nIs that why the Senate brought in machines to count ballots?\n\nNeither Logan nor the Senate issued any public statements about the inability to quantify the results of the hand count.\n\nThe hand count ended on June 25, 2021. Days later, Fann said Logan\'s hand count of ballots were far off Maricopa County\'s official results. Fann on July 8 said the Senate had purchased two machine counters as a way to ""triple check"" the numbers.\n\nShe did not disclose the number Logan provided.\n\nWas the Arizona \'audit\' part of a larger election scheme?\n\nThe text messages show Logan already was part of a coordinated effort to overturn 2020 election results in several swing states when he was tapped to lead the Arizona Senate\'s partisan ""audit,"" records show.\n\nThousands of text messages to and from Logan show he worked closely with allies of then-President Donald Trump as they plotted to challenge outcomes in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nTexts show that Fann privately communicated with Logan in February 2021, likely on a recommendation from retired Army Col. Phil Waldron, an ardent Trump supporter and election conspiracy theorist. She publicly named Logan as the audit leader on March 31, 2021.\n\nFull story: Arizona \'audit\' leader traded messages with dozens of \'Stop the Steal\' partisans, texts show\n\nWhen did Logan start strategizing with Trump allies?\n\nLess than two weeks after Trump lost the November 2020 election, Logan was invited to pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood\'s plantation properties in South Carolina to map out ways for challenging election results in swing states, texts and court records show.\n\nLogan testified in a Georgia civil elections case last year that he stayed at the plantation for about six weeks, from Nov. 14 until Dec. 24, rubbing shoulders with members of Trump\'s legal team and other loyalists.\n\nWho on Team Trump helped Logan?\n\nThe strategy meetings involved a who\'s who of Trumpworld conspiracy theorists, cyber specialists, lawyers, retired government officials and some Republican state lawmakers.\n\nThe group included Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, former National Security Agency official Jim Penrose, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Former Army Capt. Seth Keshel.\n\nAll later would participate in the Maricopa County ballot review. They helped Logan raise millions for the ""audit,"" helped him write reports and offered logistical support, texts and court records show.\n\nAre authorities investigating Logan?\n\nLogan was involved in multiple breaches of voting equipment in Georgia and Michigan in the weeks leading up to the Arizona ""audit,"" texts and court records show.\n\nIn January 2021, he and others were captured on video surveillance heading into an elections office in Coffee County, Georgia, where authorities said voting equipment was breached. He has not been charged there.\n\nLogan is under investigation by Michigan authorities for illegally accessing and dismantling voting machines in April 2021 as part of a plot to prove the election was rigged. He has not been charged there.\n\nHow did The Republic get Logan\'s text messages?\n\nThe Republic in June 2021 requested emails, text messages and all other communications from Cyber Ninjas and the Senate. When they refused, The Republic filed lawsuits alleging violations of the Arizona Pubic Records Law.\n\nA judge in January 2022 ordered Logan to turn over all records and communications related to the audit and fined his company $50,000 a day until he complied. The fines now total more than $5 million.\n\nIs Logan still withholding records?\n\nYes. Logan has turned over texts in haphazard, nonsequential batches and in different formats, so threads were broken and not easily searchable. The messages, released in November and December 2022 and February and March 2023, were not organized chronologically or in any other discernable order.\n\nAnd while Logan has released more than 39,000 text messages, he has redacted 3,000 more without explanation and in apparent violation of court orders.\n\nHow did you make sense of 39,000 text messages?\n\nAn independent team of nationally recognized data analysts known as The Audit Guys built software to untangle and organize the messages.\n\nThe Audit Guys have long challenged Logan\'s ballot review as ""fiction"" and after an exhaustive analysis of data in 2021 concluded that Logan\'s ""results"" were wildly inaccurate and made up.\n\nAfter consolidating the texts in a searchable database, The Audit Guys determined Logan at one time omitted about 4,000 messages from his side of conversations and duplicated 5,500 in multiple batches. They have identified gaps in messages, blank and redacted texts and references to messaging systems that Logan never turned over.\n\nWho are The Audit Guys?\n\nThe Audit Guys are Larry Moore, the founder of Boston-based election technology company Clear Ballot Group; Benny White, a prominent Pima County Republican data analyst; and Tim Halvorsen, Clear Ballot\'s retired chief technology officer.\n\nTheir stated mission is to ""debunk election disinformation and confront those who use their power to spread it.""\n\nWhy does the hand count matter two years later?\n\nLogan\'s findings allowed Trump allies to insist the vote was compromised. Its immediate aftermath was to further instill distrust in voting machines and encourage partisan calls for paper ballot tabulations, hand recounts and ""audits."" They have also called for an end to early voting.\n\nWith the 2024 election around the corner, many partisan actors claim without evidence that machine tabulated ballots are rife with fraud. And they insist the only way to prevent fraud is through a hand count of ballots.\n\nLook no farther than Cochise County, where Republican officials in 2022 sought to delay certification of the election until after commissioning a full hand count, which was blocked by the courts.\n\nA judge in April fined two Cochise County supervisors $37,000 in legal and court fees for failing to follow state elections procedures.\n\nHow much has the Arizona \'audit\' cost taxpayers?\n\nTaxpayer costs are about $5 million so far. That includes $518,000 Maricopa County spent in its fight with Senate Republicans over access to its voting equipment and related records and $3.2 million for new voting machines. The Senate has spent at least $1.1 million, of which about half has been spent on legal fees.\n\nIn addition to the public costs, Cyber Ninjas received at least $6.7 million from private donors. The firm last year said it had lost at least $2 million, according to a financial statement shared with the Senate.\n\nCyber Ninjas has since gone out of business'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/arizona-election-audit-full-ineptitude-110509832.html', 'Headline': ""Arizona election 'audit' full of ineptitude, infighting and deceit ..."", 'Snippet': 'Thousands of new documents The Arizona Republic obtained from Cyber Ninjas, the obscure company state Senate Republicans hired to conduct a partisan ""audit"" of the 2020 election, show the endeavor ...', 'Full_text': 'Thousands of new documents The Arizona Republic obtained from Cyber Ninjas, the obscure company state Senate Republicans hired to conduct a partisan ""audit"" of the 2020 election, show the endeavor was fraught with conflict and confusion.\n\nThe contractors confided they didn\'t know Arizona election law when they were hired, struggled to pay bills and raise money, fought over what to report to the Senate, got deeply sidetracked by a film about their effort, and consistently were in touch with people who tried to concoct ways to keep former President Trump in office after his election loss.\n\nAmong the most revealing details in the new documents are that the lead contractor reached out to people close to Trump to ask for money to conduct the supposedly objective ""audit,"" and others involved communicated with the former president as well.\n\nThe Republic and a left-leaning watchdog group called American Oversight sued the Senate and Cyber Ninjas for emails, texts and other communications from the project and have received batches of documents for more than a year.\n\nDoug Logan, the CEO at now-defunct Florida-based Cyber Ninjas, which former Senate President Karen Fann chose to direct the work, has continued to fight the release of all of his communications, which a judge said were subject to disclosure.\n\nBut facing a $50,000-a-day fine imposed more than a year ago, he recently turned over thousands of texts and Signal messages.\n\nWhile many of the documents remain redacted, those that aren\'t shed new light on the operation, which involved Senate Republicans allowing Logan and a crew of subcontractors to count and inspect about 2.1 million ballots at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in summer 2021.\n\nThese are the key takeaways from the tens of thousands of new messages.\n\nThe contractors didn\'t understand Arizona election procedures\n\nSeveral messages indicate what experts have suggested regarding Cyber Ninjas, Wake Technologies, StratTech and others involved: They did not know much about elections, ballots or what they were looking for.\n\nOn March 21, 2021, as he was finalizing his agreement to work for the Arizona Senate, Logan had a conversation with Wake TSI executive Gene Kern. They shared an article from Phoenix\'s National Public Radio station, KJZZ, explaining how candidates’ names are ordered on ballots.\n\n“It’s on my list to read through the Arizona election laws,” Logan wrote. “I guess I should move that up on the list.”\n\nKern replied: “Yep. I hate reading law.”\n\nThey also joked about Dominion Voting Systems equipment changing votes, even though Logan apparently was ""impressed"" with the machines.\n\nDominion makes a host of equipment used in elections and the company filed multiple defamation lawsuits amid unfounded allegations about it engaging in election fraud.\n\nOn March 29, Logan told Kern that Dominion might send someone from the company to observe if Cyber Ninjas was allowed to inspect voting equipment in Arizona.\n\n“Good. We have a guy who works on people for getting confessions,” Kern responded.\n\nLogan replied: “ROFL.”\n\nMessages also reveal that Cyber Ninjas and its subcontractors struggled to count ballots.\n\nOn June 11, 2021, as the hand count was underway, a worker messaged Logan that an attorney involved with the effort, Bryan Blehm, recommended recounting some of the ballots to correct errors.\n\n""Bryan suggested that if we finish counting, we re-do red boxes and correct them,"" he wrote.\n\nAt this time, various lawmakers and other visitors from other states who were sympathetic to Trump’s claims of a stolen election were touring the coliseum as they considered launching audits of their own.\n\nComments from the contractor appear to indicate the workers made sure they had something to see as they toured the room strewn with spinning tables used to count ballots.\n\n“Please load me up with some people for Friday and Saturday so our visitors can see spinning,” the worker wrote Logan.\n\nThe first day of the recount in April 2021 drew instant national attention when an Arizona Republic reporter questioned why counters were equipped with blue pens. Blue ink can alter a ballot, causing it to be discarded, or confusing the voter\'s intent.\n\nThe state Elections Procedures Manual specifically states that anyone involved with the hand count of ballots cannot use pens with blue or black ink, which the contractors appeared not to know.\n\nThe pens were changed out and the reporter, Jen Fifield, was disparagingly dubbed ""Blue Pen Jen"" in messages from people working on the audit, even though her observation likely saved them from greater embarrassment and possible legal action had they begun work with blue pens.\n\n""We are expecting a possible hit piece from Blue Pen Jen tomorrow,"" Logan wrote to OAN Network personality and audit fundraiser Christina Bobb one day in June.\n\nBobb responded: ""Anything you want me to put out ahead of time to ruin her story?""\n\nMore from this investigation:Cyber Ninjas\' ties to Trump during Arizona election \'audit\' revealed in messages\n\n\'Dialing for dollars?\': Money was a constant concern\n\nThroughout the ballot review, Logan complained about the lack of money to complete the work, often complaining he was losing millions on the project and pulling money from his own business to keep things running.\n\nLogan and a contact named ""Todd"" discussed possibly hosting a telethon once the work was done in December 2021. They also discussed Logan and another contractor signing items to offer at an auction.\n\n“Dialing for dollars?” Logan asked. “Pretty much,” Todd responded. Todd\'s identity is unclear.\n\nIn August, Logan told a subcontractor that Kern took a $70,000 bonus on top of his salary before paying his workers. Kern\'s company stopped working on the audit shortly after it began.\n\nAsked about this recently, Kern said he did not take such a bonus, and that Wake TSI is still owed $530,000 from Logan for work on the project.\n\n""The contact was fixed price plus expenses. What we committed to pay staff was not part of the contract,"" Kern said via email.\n\nSenate leaders at the time said Wake left because the company had reached the end of its contract. But the new documents make clear that Wake officials and Logan fought over money, with Wake even threatening to sue after the company was not paid months after it left Arizona.\n\nLogan declined to comment when asked about the discrepancy over the $70,000.\n\nRegarding Wake\'s departure from the project, Kern said it was Logan\'s decision.\n\n""The initial contract term completed. Doug Logan decided that he was going to complete the project on his own,"" Kern said.\n\nOn Nov. 8, 2021, more than a month after the final report on the review was sent to the Senate, Logan lamented how much money he’d spent on the audit. He said he was morally opposed to bankruptcy but that he spent all the profits from his company and all his savings.\n\n“I run a business that in a typical year grosses about $850k. On a good year I have $175k in profits on top of my salary of $125k. I have paid out $225k-$250k more than I have even fund raised. That’s all of last year’s profits, all of my savings, and any money we made this year from my AppSec business. ALL of this has been put into the audit,” Logan wrote, adding that he has lost clients, cut staff, and still owed $2.1 million to other companies.\n\nSenate concealed Jovan Pulitzer’s involvement\n\nWhen Senate Republicans announced the contractors that would work on the ballot review in March 2021, they didn’t mention the eccentric treasure hunter/inventor Jovan Pulitzer.\n\nThe new documents reveal Pulitzer was fully engaged with Logan throughout the year. He and Logan messaged continuously from March through the end of 2021.\n\nFann and other lawmakers thought Pulitzer was too controversial to include in the ballot review and they wanted to keep his name away from it, according to messages previously released to The Republic.\n\n""Jovan posting on Youtube and Twitter is not helping us with selecting an independent, unbiased auditing firm,"" Fann wrote in February 2021 as she sought a contractor for the election review.\n\nShe was communicating at the time with Phil Waldron, a retired Army colonel who worked with President Trump’s chief of staff after his 2020 defeat to keep Trump in office.\n\nWaldron responded: ""He will not be working with our team. … I think Jovan is incapable of \'discrete.\'""\n\nDuring the actual review work, officials only would say that Pulitzer was consulted.\n\nLater, emails disclosed through The Republic’s lawsuit revealed Pulitzer was in fact involved in the work. More documents released after continued court action showed Logan paid Pulitzer\'s company called 423 Catkins Maize $210,000 for work photographing ballots.\n\nLogan declined to comment recently when asked if he felt this was dishonest. Pulitzer also declined to comment for this article.\n\nAnd the latest messages show that at least some Senate Republicans, including Fann and Warren Petersen, knew he was working with Logan and wanted to keep his name off of the report.\n\nIn May 2021, Logan floated the idea of bringing Pulitzer to Arizona to help troubleshoot cameras used to photograph ballots, though he noted that such a visit would include limitations.\n\n“I can’t have you at the coliseum or people will flip out,” Logan wrote to Pulitzer.\n\nLogan and Pulitzer discussed many aspects of the work, from fundraising, press coverage and technical details to how to present information to the Senate. They often disagreed.\n\nAs the final report was being prepared in September 2021, they debated “Sharpiegate” the theory that certain pens can bleed through ballots and invalidate votes by making it appear the ballot has too many ovals filled in on the other side.\n\nPulitzer wanted details included. Logan didn\'t, writing, ""Sharpiegate isn’t real.”\n\n""The Dominion machine is actually quite precise,"" Logan continued. ""I was kind of impressed.""\n\nIt\'s unclear what experience Logan is citing with Dominion equipment, but he is linked to two criminal investigations for possibly accessing equipment in Georgia and Michigan in early 2021 before he came to work in Arizona. He was shown on security cameras entering a rural Georgia elections office.\n\nIt appears Logan was not always happy with Pulitzer, but he fought to include his work in his final report in Arizona.\n\nOn Sept. 14 that year, Logan seemed to lose his temper with Pulitzer as they argued about edits in the report to the Senate and whether Logan would be able to convince the Senate to include Pulitzer\'s work. Logan told him, “Go jump in a freaking lake.”\n\nOn Sept. 18 Logan told Pulitzer he met with the Senate and they wanted no mention of Pulitzer in the final report and senators instructed Logan not to even speak to Pulitzer again until issuing the final report, to which he would not agree.\n\nHe said the Senate lawyer threatened to declare them in breach of contract but Fann “backed him off.” He said he convinced them Pulitzer’s findings on “paper, calibration and bleed through” were important, but one unnamed member didn’t want Pulitzer’s name associated with those items. Pulitzer responded that Logan could remove his name from the report.\n\nOn Oct. 1, after the final report was made public, Logan told Pulitzer he stood up for Pulitzer’s work to Fann and “got your stuff to remain in the report.”\n\nEven after the release of the audit findings, Logan and Pulitzer continued to investigate the election, even though Logan\'s report was finalized and none of the private funders of the work appeared willing to give them more money.\n\n\'The Deep Rig\' appearance almost sunk the project\n\nWhile Logan was in the midst of the election review, a low-budget movie called “The Deep Rig” financed by Trump sympathizer Patrick Byrne debuted, including footage of Logan discussing fraud in elections.\n\nBecause Logan’s agreement with the Senate forbade him from making public comments, he fretted about footage of him in the trailer and film, even though he apparently let the filmmakers into the restricted coliseum.\n\nThe movie attempted to persuade audiences the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, though no evidence was presented, only conjecture.\n\nByrne, the founder and former CEO of Overstock.com, also appeared in the film and addressed a live audience at its Phoenix premier.\n\nLogan’s private messages show he tried to delay the release and get his interview removed so he didn’t lose his contract. The producers removed him from the film only after its premiere, which included the Logan footage.\n\nFann told Logan on June 3 that he, consultant Steve Montenegro and liaison Ken Bennett “need to get on the same page and out in front of this thing,” regarding the forthcoming movie release. “It’s being twisted that you and Ken are part of the crazy Q people which will hurt the audit.”\n\nOn June 18, Logan messaged Byrne that he was concerned. He said support in the Senate already was weak.\n\n“This is going to be viewed as me breaking my agreement with them on public statements. Let alone what the leftist media is going to do with it. It is very likely to scare off PA, who is going to be difficult to convince,” he wrote, apparently anticipating he would be hired to conduct a similar election review in Pennsylvania. He wasn\'t.\n\nByrne said Logan was made anonymous in the film. Byrne also told Logan that his voice was turned into a combination of Daffy Duck and Barry White speaking over each other.\n\nBut Logan said that since the trailer for the film included Logan, he wasn’t really anonymous.\n\nLogan also argued about his appearance in the film with producer Steve Lucescu in private messages before the release.\n\nThey discussed Lucescu visiting the coliseum with Logan. In one heated message, Lucescu said “That is bull---t Doug. You dropped the ball and now trying to blame me because your wife is freaking out on you.”\n\nThe film premiered in late June. Logan at first appeared blurred out for dramatic effect, but his identity was revealed later in the film.\n\nAfter the premiere, Logan told the producer he no longer wanted anything to do with the movie. The producer told him after the release it was Byrne’s decision to leave him in the film and that he was removed from it for future showings.\n\nIn the end, it didn’t seem like Byrne liked the film he financed. He wrote a scathing critique he shared with Logan.\n\nBryne wrote that the ""first 20 minutes are awful. It is like an Ancient Aliens meets Michael Clayton.”\n\nSeveral sitting lawmakers were involved\n\nMany of the Republican lawmakers involved in the ballot review are now serving in the Legislature after the November election. The newly released documents show a deeper level of involvement for some of them than previously known.\n\nWhile Fann is no longer in office, Petersen, who appears to have received briefings about all of the audit’s proceedings, is now the Senate president.\n\nThrough a Senate spokeswoman, he declined to comment on the new messages.\n\n""President Petersen and the rest of our leadership team are working diligently and are focused on the big issues our state is currently facing. Rehashing 2020 is not one of them,"" spokeswoman Kim Quintero said.\n\nPetersen, R-Gilbert, repeatedly scolded Logan for the partisan tone of the Twitter accounts linked with the audit, and for posing with out-of-state lawmakers who visited Arizona and took photos with Logan.\n\n""Some of those legislators are whacky or could do something whacky in the future,"" he wrote. ""You will forever have a photo with them.""\n\nAlexander Kolodin was the lawyer for the Cyber Ninjas early on, and he’s now a member of the Arizona House who has introduced legislation related to elections.\n\n""Alexander has gone a bit crazy inserting himself into all sorts of stuff that I didn\'t even directly ask him to do so,"" Logan once wrote to Bobb about Kolodin, adding that he was concerned Kolodin\'s primary motivation was raising money and not doing what was best for Logan.\n\nAnother name that appears in the messages with Logan is that of Liz Harris, who led hundreds of people to contact voters in a ""canvass"" as part of the audit. She was elected to the Arizona House in November.\n\nOn April 21, 2021, she sent a message to a group of audit contractors that she apparently received from a contact.\n\n""I just received word from someone affiliated with the airlines who told me two planes full of Antifa just landed in Phoenix,"" the message said. ""He is working on trying to find out what hotels they are staying right now.""\n\nNobody responded.\n\nBennett, who served as the liaison watching the audit for the Senate as well as a media spokesperson for the work, was elected to the state Senate, where he previously served as president.\n\nAnthony Kern, who helped count ballots but was kicked out of the audit because he was on the ballot as a Trump elector and it made the audit look bad, also returned to the Legislature this year.\n\nMontenegro helped run the controversial audit Twitter accounts that eventually were removed from the platform, and he was reelected to the state Legislature.\n\nSeveral messages from the audit involving Montenegro are redacted.\n\nHe messaged with Logan in May regarding then Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who had observers on the floor of the Coliseum, but Logan\'s lawyer redacted many of the messages, citing “discussion of legal issues.”\n\nMontenegro is not a lawyer. He runs a consulting firm.\n\nOn May 17, Montenegro sent Logan a letter county officials prepared in response to Fann, who was often at odds with the Republican county supervisors because of their reluctance to support the unusual election review.\n\nThe audit subcontractors and Senate Republicans claimed the county ""deleted"" election-related files on a server that was being inspected by the subcontractors. The county issued a letter rejecting those claims, and said that it was “incompetence” from the people working on the audit that lead them to believe the files were deleted when they were in fact on the server.\n\n“Let’s shred it apart,” Montenegro wrote to Logan.\n\nLogan responded after he read the letter.\n\n“Mostly bs,” he said. “Totally sick of being called names.”\n\nLogan also asked Montenegro if he could sue for defamation.\n\n“You always have the option man. It is ridiculous,” Montenegro responded.\n\nLogan never filed a defamation case against the county.\n\nSomeone on Logan’s team wrote and leaked a fake final report\n\nWhen Logan was presenting his final report to the Senate, a fake version of his report was circulating that claimed the county election was compromised. Logan said at the time the information in that doctored report was false.\n\nThe fake report, which was reported on a right-wing news site, said ""the election should not be certified, and the reported results are not reliable."" Logan\'s actual report made no such claim, and he disavowed the fake document.\n\nLogan\'s new messages make it clear he believed both the actual report and the fabricated version of it were leaked from his own circle.\n\nOn Sept. 19 Logan told Bobb he was going to share “a very important report ;-)” with a “friend of mine who is a reporter.”\n\nThen a few days later on Sept. 23 he was shocked to find his report was leaked. “I could cry,” he wrote.\n\nLogan also messaged a subcontractor on Sept. 27, 2021, lamenting the fake audit document.\n\n“I still can’t believe someone leaked my report; and then someone ‘leaked” a fake executive summary not from me,” he wrote.\n\nHe lamented the leak to Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser who was a leader of the “Stop the Steal” movement after of Trump’s 2020 loss.\n\nLogan said he was being attacked by ""my side"" because people were following a ""narrative"" that he had been intimidated into watering down his own final report.\n\n""I am about done with this crap,"" Logan wrote. ""I shouldn\'t be attacked by \'my side.\'""\n\nThe long response from Flynn is redacted.\n\nControversial lawyer was deeply involved\n\nThe new documents also show Logan communicated extensively with Stefanie Lambert, a controversial lawyer who could lose her license to practice law in Michigan because of her participation in a meritless election case. Her involvement in Arizona was previously unknown.\n\nMost of the messages with her are redacted, including several that are described as “ways to combat Dominion’s press release.”\n\nDominion issued a news release in 2021 critical of Logan\'s and Cyber Ninjas’ qualifications.\n\nLambert and Logan also discussed funding for the work and other issues.\n\nLambert was among nine lawyers, including Sidney Powell, involved in a failed lawsuit attempting to overturn Michigan’s 2020 election. The case was nicknamed “The Kraken” as a reference to a 1980s film in which a large sea monster is unleashed upon a city.\n\nAmong the discredited theories in the lawsuit is that ballot tabulating software crafted by confederates of deceased Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez helped a massive conspiracy against Trump, carried out in Michigan and other swing states.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Linda Parker ruled against the challenge in a scathing 36-page opinion.\n\n“This lawsuit seems to be less about achieving the relief Plaintiffs seek — as much of that relief is beyond the power of this Court — and more about the impact of their allegations on People’s faith in the democratic process and their trust in our government,"" she wrote.\n\nIn addition to about $175,000 in sanctions the lawyers were ordered to pay to cover the state and city legal fees, Parker ordered the lawyers involved to complete and pay for at least six hours of coursework on pleading standards and at least six hours on election law.\n\nThe judge in that case, as well as high-ranking Democrats in Michigan, have petitioned for Lambert and the other lawyers involved in the case to be disbarred.\n\nRepublic reporter Justin Price contributed to this article.\n\nReach reporter Ryan Randazzo at ryan.randazzo@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4331.

""This office has a solemn duty to be transparent and honest with the people of Arizona.""\n\nThe office could have put an end to many conspiracies surrounding the 2020 election results more than a year ago. Instead, Brnovich fueled concerns about systemwide problems. Mayes said resources could have been spent elsewhere protecting the people of Arizona.\n\n""At some point, nearly every single agent in the office was pulled into investigating the 2020 election,"" Mayes said.\n\nAn earlier release of the documents could have answered continued questions from Arizona Senate Republicans, who had launched an election review over concerns whether Joe Biden was rightly elected president. It also could have debunked allegations by a host of Arizona candidates running in 2022 on claims of election irregularities.\n\nOf particular concern to Mayes was the initial report released publicly by Brnovich in April 2022 suggesting the county\'s election system could not be completely trusted.\n\nAccording to one of the internal memos, investigators\' annotations on the initial report showed their concerns with some of Brnovich\'s major claims.\n\n""Most of the investigators\' comments refute the main points of the report,"" Mayes said. ""It is unsettling to learn those findings were not released in that report.""\n\nBrnovich, a Republican, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nMayes, a Democrat, stopped short of saying whether there was any action or recourse the office could take against Brnovich.\n\n""The most important thing now is getting this information out,"" she said, promising more documents would be forthcoming, including a 500-page attachment to the reports that is still being reviewed.\n\nNewly released reports undermine Brnovich\'s claims\n\nDocuments released Wednesday show the Attorney General\'s Office had summarized its findings in March 2022, a month before Brnovich released the initial report.\n\nA 24-page report on the investigation by an assistant chief special agent of the criminal division detailed an exhaustive process that examined 638 separate complaints of alleged fraud, including those made by elected officials, that prompted 438 investigations and took more than 10,000 hours to complete.\n\nThe report concluded, in case after case, that the allegations were unfounded.\n\nBrnovich in April 2022:Report on election in Maricopa County questions procedures, doesn\'t allege wrongdoing\n\nBrnovich said in April 2022 the initial investigation ""revealed serious vulnerabilities that must be addressed and raises questions about the 2020 election in Arizona."" Brnovich, who was running in a competitive GOP primary for the U.S. Senate, maintained that his office would continue its probe.\n\nThe new documents show that Brnovich\'s investigators sought to edit the interim report and temper conclusions to reflect the actual findings. Brnovich did not include them in his report.\n\nFor instance, when Brnovich said the election system was broken, an investigator wrote in a note that the Maricopa County Recorder\'s Office followed procedures. ""Investigators examined the policy and procedures followed by the MCRO relative to signature verification ... we did not uncover any criminality or fraud having beencommitted in this area during the 2020 general election,"" the note said.\n\nWhere Brnovich sought to call into question the signature verification of early ballots, investigators suggested changing the report to include language about the steps county elections officials took to train workers. ""Investigators learned that the MCRO hired additional staff to work on signature verification due to the sheer volume of ballots to be processed,"" the note said.\n\nWhere Brnovich suggested the signature review process was not as vigorous as it was in 2018, an investigator wrote, ""Investigators did not compare the 2020 general election ballot rejection rate to any election in 2018.""\n\nWhere Brnovich said there were no uniform procedures in place to ensure ballot procedures were being processed correctly in all counties, an investigator wrote the office ""has not conducted a comparativeanalysis of signature verification processes for other counties.""\n\nAnd where Brnovich wrote that Maricopa County election officials were at times combative and litigious, an investigator wrote of the Maricopa County Recorder\'s Office: ""It is the collective opinion ... based upon our experiences ― that MCRO, who was represented by counsel, was cooperative and responsive to our requests in light of the fact they did not have the staffing numbers they did during the 2020 general election and the office was running elections for various other governing bodies.""\n\nCounty officials were notified by Mayes\' office that they no longer were under investigation.\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer said he was glad that investigators recognized the office\'s cooperation.\n\n""It’s nice to know that somebody in the office — whoever wrote the comments in \'track changes\' that were then deleted — had a problem with just flat lying about our level of cooperation,"" Richer told The Republic.\n\nRicher said he is still ""very confused"" as to how the interim report concluded his office was uncooperative. He also said he had never heard of a prosecutor\'s office filing an interim report on an ongoing investigation.\n\n""We cooperated at all stages,"" he said. ""We spent countless hours answering the emails of their investigators, gathering information, inviting them to our facilities, showing them our technology infrastructure, walking them through or processes.""\n\nClint Hickman, chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, issued a statement that said in part, ""I would like our Maricopa County residents to know that I am absolutely disgusted by the revelations that former Attorney General Mark Brnovich failed to do his job as a public servant representing the highest law enforcement elected position in the state. He and his leadership team concealed a report that proved the November 2020 election was conducted fairly, lawfully, and accurately.\n\n""Not only did he ignore his own investigators in issuing a different, \'interim report,\' he falsely suggested wrongdoing by Maricopa County, never correcting the record and blatantly never sharing the team’s final report with the public. This was a gross misuse of his elected office and an appalling waste of taxpayer dollars, as well as a waste of the time and effort of professional investigators.""\n\nThe Republic for months sought copies of a final report and filed multiple public records requests for material related to the findings, including draft reports. Brnovich\'s office said in December there were no records available.\n\n""No final report was issued, therefore there are no responsive documents to the attached request,"" his office said in a Dec. 2 email. It ignored follow-up requests.\n\nAttorney general\'s investigation came at Senate\'s request\n\nBrnovich launched the investigation after the Arizona Senate\'s discredited review of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County\'s 2020 election to determine if the election had been rigged against former President Donald Trump.\n\nFormer Senate President Karen Fann, who authorized the so-called ""audit,"" asked Brnovich to investigate the findings of its lead audit contractor, Cyber Ninjas, a Florida-based cybersecurity firm, which has since gone out of business.\n\nCyber Ninjas and its subcontractors were paid millions by nonprofits set up by Trump allies and prominent figures in the “Stop the Steal” movement.\n\nCyber Ninjas\' CEO Doug Logan in a September 2021 report to the Senate confirmed the ballot review showed Trump lost the election. But his report minimized the ballot counts and instead raised questions about the county\'s election process and voter integrity that were later repudiated by election officials.\n\nIn the second internal memo released Wednesday ― a Sept. 19, 2022, summary of the election investigation ― Chief Special Agent Reginald Grigsby again reported the Attorney General\'s Office had found no fraud. And again, Brnovich did not make the report public.\n\nAttorney general\'s investigators interviewed lawmakers such as then-state Rep. Mark Finchem and state Sens. Sonny Borelli and Wendy Rogers, all of whom had publicly claimed widespread fraud and election irregularities. None provided any actual evidence to investigators.\n\n""While a significant majority of the complaints alleged irregularities with the election process, no evidence of election fraud, manipulation of the election process, or any instances of organized/coordinated fraud was provided by any of the complaining parties,"" Grigsby wrote.\n\nRobert Anglen is an investigative reporter for The Republic.

Rand Paul was an opportunity for the GOP to, in a moment echoing one of the McCarthy era’s most notorious hearings ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s foremost experts on infectious diseases, has at long last reached the end of his rope. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was hectoring him in a congressional hearing, when he said, “You are the lead architect responsible from the government, and now 800,000 people have died.”\n\nAs Fauci began his response, stressing masks and vaccines for the umpteenth time, Paul interrupted, “and you have advocated to make it coercive and done by force, and you’ve advocated it be done by mandate.”\n\nRising to high moral dudgeon, Paul resorted to sarcasm: “You have advocated that your infallible opinion be dictated by law.”\n\nFauci had had enough. He put Paul’s attacks into context – and the context is dark.\n\n“I have threats upon my life,” he said. “Harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.” Fauci then got into specifics, and they are chilling: “Just about three or four weeks ago, on December 21, a person was arrested who was on their way from Sacramento to Washington, DC at a speed stop in Iowa. And the police asked him where he was going. And he was going to Washington, DC to kill Dr. Fauci. And they found in his car an AR-15 and multiple magazines of ammunition, because he thinks that maybe I’m killing people.”\n\nNow we know the threat of physical violence is real. The Capitol itself was the scene of a violent and vicious attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot and grievously wounded by a gunman in 2017, and Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head at point blank range in 2011 by a man who murdered a federal judge and five others in the attack.\n\nBut Fauci took it one step further on Wednesday, offering a theory behind Paul’s attacks. He displayed screen shots he said were from one of Paul’s political websites, seeking to raise campaign donations from his attacks on Fauci.\n\nHaving been through more political song and dance than I care to recall, I think I can spot insincerity. Fauci’s response, I believe, was real. It was raw. And it was righteous.\n\nFauci is not infallible, but he is a dedicated public servant who has spent his long career trying to protect Americans from illness and death. He deserves tough questions, to be sure, and even criticism where warranted. But at a time when national security officials warn that, “We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists,” Paul seems to have crossed a line.\n\nThe fact the Rand Paul for Senate committee is raising money on a website called firefauci.org suggests that politics, rather than public health, might be part of the motivation of the junior senator from Kentucky.\n\nThe Senate has always had demagogues, liars and outliers who go too far. Fauci’s measured but heartfelt takedown should have been a Joseph Welch moment. Welch was the lawyer for the US Army when the notorious Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin was spreading hysterical chargers that communists had infiltrated the army, along with the State Department, Treasury and even the White House.\n\nWhen McCarthy impugned a young lawyer from Welch’s firm, the soft-spoken, bespectacled Welch could take it no more. “Until this moment, senator,” he said, “I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” McCarthy was stunned into silence, as Welch continued, “Have you no sense of decency?”\n\nWelch’s response broke the fever. Six months later, McCarthy was formally censured by his Senate colleagues 67-22. Half of the Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn their fellow Republican.\n\nNot now. Paul’s rant against Fauci produced a strong and immediate condemnation from Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “Thank you, first of all, for what you do,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to put your life at risk…. And thank you for calling out this agenda for what it is: an attempt to score political points, to build a political power base around the denial of science and around personal attacks on you and your family.”\n\nBut where was the GOP condemnation of Paul? Nearly nonexistent.\n\nTo his credit, though, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah defended Fauci. “Some of what we do [in these hearings] is performing,” he said, in an apparent reference to Paul’s attack. “And some of what we do is to become informed.”\n\nHe went on to stress his appreciation for Fauci and the other scientists who were testifying. “I do want to point out how much I personally, and I believe the great majority of the people of our country respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do. You are scientists, not politicians. Nevertheless, you are being made subject to the political whims of various political individuals, and that comes at a high cost.”\n\nTwo cheers for Romney for defending Fauci and for labeling the attacks on him as political. But I do wish he had followed through and condemned his GOP colleague the way Republicans condemned McCarthy decades ago. Perhaps that’s too much to ask in these hyper-partisan times.\n\nPerhaps Romney has assessed that condemning Paul might have opposite effect of the censure of McCarthy; that if he were to condemn Paul the result would be a diminution of Romney’s political strength within the Trumpified GOP, while strengthening Paul even more.\n\nThat is a depressing thought, but likely accurate. So long as there is money to be raised, clicks to be earned, votes to be gained, we can expect power-hungry politicians to, well, be reckless and dangerous – even during a deadly pandemic. It seems that political decency is not as contagious as Omicron.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/1687863/watch-paul-grills-fauci-and-threatens-new-rules-when-gop-is-in-charge/', 'Headline': 'WATCH: Paul grills Fauci and threatens new rules when GOP is ‘in charge’', 'Snippet': 'Sen.

We’re going to learn about it. I promise you that,” Paul warned Fauci.\n\nThe duo has been known to trade barbs in the past, but Fauci appeared more serene and unfazed than he has in past showdowns in which he had been visibly riled by his Senate nemesis. The exchange occurred during a hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\nDuring the barrage of questions, Paul also hammered Fauci’s position on immunology, playing an edited clip of Fauci advising someone in a 2004 C-SPAN interview that they did not need to receive a flu shot. Paul used the clip to insinuate Fauci contradicted his position on COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHowever, as Fauci and a Reuter’s fact check noted, the clip featured Fauci discussing the flu vaccine with someone who described having a reaction to it — Fauci was not voicing opposition to the vaccine for the general public.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nFauci announced last month that he will depart from his role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and as the chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden by the end of the year.

The man had an AR-15 rifle in his vehicle, along with magazines of ammunition, police said.\n\n""So I asked myself, \'Why would senator want to do this?\' So go to Rand Paul website and you see \'Fire Dr. Fauci\' with a little box that says, \'Contribute here.\' You can do $5, $10, $20, $100,"" Fauci said. ""So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.""\n\nPaul said earlier in the hearing that an email exchange between Fauci and Dr. Francis Collins, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, showed Fauci and Collins appearing to disagree with scientists who said the coronavirus originated in a lab in China.\n\n""You know, you\'re going back to that original discussion when I brought together a group of people to look at every possibility with an open mind,"" Fauci said. ""So you\'re not only distorting it, you are completely turning it around, as you usually do.""\n\nPaul said in a statement after the hearing, ""Anyone who dares to question Fauci’s smear campaign against other scientists is accused by Fauci of fomenting violence.""\n\n""As someone who actually was the target of semiautomatic gunfire by a Bernie Sanders supporter, I never once accused Senator Sanders of being responsible for the attack and I resent Fauci avoiding the question by ginning up the idea that his opponents are the cause of threats,"" Paul added.\n\nPaul was referring to a 2017 shooting when Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and three other people were wounded after a gunman opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team as they were holding a practice in Alexandria, Va.\n\nIan Sams, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesman, said in a statement after the hearing: ""When it comes to misinformation, Republicans on the committee clearly weren\'t trying to stop the spread.\n\n""At a time when America is seeing rising COVID cases, it’s disappointing and frankly unacceptable that Republican Senators chose to spend a hearing with the country’s leading public health experts spreading conspiracy theories and lies about Dr. Fauci, rather than how we protect people from COVID-19,"" Sams said.\n\nPaul, a steadfast opponent of Covid mitigation measures and mask mandates, has clashed with Fauci before over other pandemic-related issues. Paul was the first senator known to have contracted the coronavirus when he tested positive in March 2020.\n\nIn July, Paul implied that Fauci had previously lied to Congress and was aware of what the lab in Wuhan, China, was doing with grant money that came from the NIH.\n\nTuesday\'s hearing also sparked a tense exchange between Fauci and Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., about Fauci\'s financial disclosures and investments.\n\nAfter the back-and-forth, Fauci was heard on a hot mic saying: ""What a moron.

Roger Marshall of Kansas as a “moron” on a hot mic.\n\nFauci and Paul have repeatedly clashed during Senate hearings in recent months and engaged in yet another verbal throwdown before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nAt one point, Fauci accused Paul of claiming he was “responsible for the death of 4 to 5 million people, which is really irresponsible.”\n\n“What happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue,” the top health official said, “is that kindles the crazies out there, and I have threats upon my life, harassment of my family and my children with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.”\n\nFauci then referenced the arrest last month of 25-year-old Kuachua Brillion Xiong, of California, who was found to have a “hit list” with Fauci’s name on it when he was pulled over on Interstate 80 in Iowa.\n\n“They found in his car an AR-15 and multiple magazines of ammunition,” the top doc said, “because he thinks that maybe I’m killing people.\n\n“So I asked myself, ‘Why would a senator want to do this?’ So [I] go to [the] Rand Paul website,” said Fauci, brandishing a sheaf of computer printouts, “and you see ‘Fire Dr. Fauci,’ with a little box that says ‘Contribute here.’ And you can do $5, $10, $20, $100.\n\n“You are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain,” Fauci began before Paul cut him off.\n\n“You have politically attacked your colleagues, and in a politically reprehensible way –” Paul started to say before committee chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) cut the exchange short.\n\nEarlier in their exchange, Paul pressed Fauci on why he would “claim unilaterally” that any criticism of him is a “criticism of science itself,” calling the idea “quite dangerous.”\n\n“A planner who believes he is the science leads to an arrogance that justifies in his mind using government resources to smear and to destroy the reputations of other scientists who disagree with them,” said Paul, who accused Fauci and then-National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins of unfairly maligning the authors of the anti-lockdown Great Barrington Declaration in late 2020.\n\n“This is not only antithetical to the scientific method, it’s cheap politics and it’s reprehensible,” Paul said. “Dr. Fauci, do you really think it’s appropriate to use your $420,000 salary to attack scientists that disagree with you?”\n\n“No, I think in usual fashion, Senator, you are distorting everything about me,” Fauci pushed back.\n\n“Senator, we are here at a committee to look at a virus now that has killed almost 900,000 people,” Fauci told Paul later in the hearing. “And the purpose of the committee was to try and get things out how we can help to get the American public. And you keep coming back to personal attacks on me that have absolutely no relevance to reality.”\n\nThe senator then asked Fauci if he thought the US response to the pandemic amounted to a “great success.”\n\n“More people have died now under President Biden than did under President Trump,” Paul said. “You are the one responsible, you are the architect — you are the lead architect for the response from the government. And now 800,000 people have died. Do you think it’s a winning success, what you’ve advocated for government?”\n\n“Senator, first of all, if you look at everything I said, you accuse me of, in a monolithic way, telling people what they need to do,” Fauci began. “Everything that I’ve said — [which] has been in support of the CDC guidelines — wear a mask, get boosted –“\n\n“And you’ve made it coercive and done by mandate,” Paul jumped in. “You’ve advocated your infallible opinion by dictated by law.”\n\nA couple of hours later, Marshall — himself a medical doctor — told Fauci, “You have an annual salary in 2020 that was $434,000. You oversee over $5 billion in federal research grants. As the highest paid employee in the entire federal government, yes or no: would you be willing to submit to Congress and the public a financial disclosure that includes your past and current investments?”\n\n“I don’t understand why you’re asking me that question,” Fauci answered. “My financial disclosure is public knowledge and has been so for the last 37 years or so.”\n\nMarshall had a printed poster positioned behind him with Fauci’s salary and retorted: “The big tech giants are doing an incredible job of keeping it from being public. We’ll continue to look for it. Where would we find it?”\n\n“All you have to do is ask for it,” Fauci fumed. “You’re so misinformed, it’s extraordinary.”\n\nMarshall pressed further, telling an increasingly flustered Fauci that, “this is a huge issue.”\n\n“Wouldn’t you agree with me that you have a — you see things before members of Congress would see them, so that there’s an air of appearance that maybe some shenanigans are going on?” Marshall said.\n\n“Senator, what are you talking about? My financial disclosures are public knowledge and have been so. You are getting amazingly wrong information. What are you talking about?” Fauci exclaimed.\n\n“We cannot find them. Our office cannot find them. Where would they be if they are public knowledge?” Marshall asked.\n\n“It is totally accessible to you if you want it,” Fauci said.\n\n“For the public? Is it accessible to the public?” Marshall continued.\n\n“To the public, to the public!” Fauci insisted.\n\n“Great, we look forward to reviewing it,” Marshall said.\n\n“Sen. Marshall, Dr. Fauci has answered you,” Murray said. “It is public information and he’s happy to give it to you if you were to ask.”\n\n”What a moron!” Fauci muttered into the live mic. “Jesus Christ!”\n\nA spokesperson for Fauci was unable to immediately point The Post to the financial disclosures that Fauci said were public. Center for Public Integrity reporter Liz Essley Whyte tweeted a copy of a disclosure form signed by Fauci in April 2020, but that document had extensive redactions.\n\n“I understand that Anthony Fauci had a very frustrating day: having a bombshell report show he in fact did award U.S. tax dollars for gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and being called out about his personal financial disclosure during the COVID pandemic NOT being publicly available must be very frustrating,” Marshall said in a statement.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/fauci-says-sen-pauls-false-accusations-kindle-the-crazies-who-threaten-his-life/2610481/', 'Headline': ""Senate Hearing on Pandemic Gets Testy: ‘What a Moron' - NBC Boston"", 'Snippet': 'Republican Sen.

Everything that I’ve said has been in support of the CDC guidelines: Wear a mask, get boosted,” Fauci said. “So I would like to make something clear to the committee. He’s doing this for political reasons.”\n\nFauci also cited threats made against his life and the lives of his family members, which Paul countered with examples of his own life being threatened over pandemic politics. Paul was also present at the 2017 baseball field shooting in Virginia when 24 Republicans practicing for a charity game were targeted by an attacker with a gun. This resulted in a shootout between the gunman and the Capitol Police. Senate Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was shot and had to undergo surgery.\n\n“It’s disappointing for you to suggest that people who dare to question you are responsible somehow for violent threats. Realize that by attacking me, you’re attacking the one member who actually has suffered from violent attacks,” Paul said. “We had over 160 rounds of semi-automatic weapons fired at us. … So for you to somehow suggest that somehow I or people who dare to oppose you are responsible for a threat, that’s insulting.”\n\nPaul and Fauci have engaged in such back-and-forth in past hearings to examine the administration’s response to COVID-19, which has a death toll approaching 840,000, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.\n\nFOUR HIGH-PROFILE DOCTORS WHO ARE CHALLENGING THE COVID-19 RESPONSE\n\nPaul also accused Fauci of refusing to acknowledge dissenting views about mitigation measures, including lockdowns.\n\nPaul cited support from the scientific community for the Great Barrington Declaration, an online petition written by three epidemiologists from Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of Oxford. The scientists who supported the declaration, now numbering above 910,000, decried early lockdown policies as being too broad to do any good for the concentrated communities most vulnerable to the virus, such as the elderly. Fauci and Collins were found to have called for a “devastating published takedown of its premises” after a Freedom of Information Act request exposed emails between them.\n\nPaul added: “A planner who believes he is the science leads to an arrogance that justifies in his mind using government resources to smear and to destroy the reputations of other scientists who disagree with them.”\n\nFauci, who held up a photo of a webpage from Paul’s site soliciting donations and calling for Fauci to be fired, said at the hearing that Paul was engaging in personal attacks against him and risking his safety.\n\n“We are here at a committee to look at a virus now that has killed almost 900,000 people, and the purpose of the committee was to try and get things out, how we can help to … the American public, and you keep coming back to personal attacks on me that have absolutely no relevance to reality,” Fauci said.\n\nUS BREAKS RECORDS ON COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATIONS AND CASES\n\nFauci and Paul most recently clashed in a November hearing, when Paul pressed Fauci on a theory that the virus was created in and escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was performing a risky type of research on pathogens called “gain of function.” Some gain-of-function research, conducted on existing pathogens, has raised concerns over the potential to enhance the pathogenicity or transmissibility of the virus. Fauci has maintained that the virus most likely arose in nature after mutating and replicating in animals before infecting humans.\n\n“It makes me very uncomfortable to have to say something, but he is egregiously incorrect in what he says,” Fauci said of Paul.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.khq.com/national/senator-patty-murray-breaks-up-tense-exchange-between-dr-fauci-and-senator-rand-paul/article_975391b8-735a-11ec-bc92-97c2832f77a5.html', 'Headline': 'Senator Patty Murray breaks up tense exchange between Dr. Fauci and ...', 'Snippet': 'But the headline from the Tuesday hearing was a tense exchange between Dr. Fauci and Senator Rand Paul.

For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners. But he has also conceded that much about how the virus came to be remains unknown.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106119', 'Headline': 'Federal Research: NIH Could Take Additional Actions to Manage Risks ...', 'Snippet': 'Specifically, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided $200,000 in grant funding to Wuhan University, the only selected Chinese entity to receive funding directly from a federal agency.

In January 2023, the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General recommended that NIH implement enhanced monitoring, documentation, and reporting requirements for award recipients with foreign subrecipients. To address this recommendation, NIH noted it may need additional authorities and plans to explore government-wide practices, which will take time. However, federal internal controls require that agencies take timely corrective actions to address risks. While NIH pursues long-term actions for award recipients, it has not conducted its own near-term assessments, which could enhance its internal oversight.\n\nWhy GAO Did This Study\n\nFederal agencies sometimes provide funds to foreign entities, such as universities and laboratories, for research or other purposes. Such collaborations can benefit agency missions and lead to advancements in areas such as public health. At the same time, Congress, the White House, and others have expressed concerns about entities from countries, such as China, exploiting U.S. funded research in ways that could harm U.S. national security or economic competitiveness.\n\nGAO was asked to provide information on federal funds disbursed to three selected Chinese entities—Wuhan University; the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.\n\nThis report examines, among other things, the amount of federal funding GAO identified that was provided to the three selected Chinese entities in calendar years 2014 through 2021 and steps agencies and award recipients have taken to assess risks.\n\nGAO searched USAspending.gov and other federal databases and reviewed award agreements, progress reports, payment information, and other documents from federal agencies and U.S.-based award recipients.

Is that correct? In other words, NIH maybe can give money to Chinese establishments, other agencies may not be able to.\n\nCandice Wright So from the work that we’ve done in the past, we’ve certainly seen where agencies have made awards to foreign entities, including entities in China. But we also are aware that there are other agencies that have limitations on funding to certain foreign countries. For example, NASA not being able to provide funding to entities in China.\n\nTom Temin And I imagine the Defense Department would not want to give, say, an artificial intelligence development grant to someone in China. Just to make an extreme example.\n\nCandice Wright I can’t really comment on that because it’s not something that I specifically looked at.\n\nTom Temin No, we’ll get back to this report. And I’m guessing this was prompted by the controversy or the question surrounding the Wuhan laboratory. And so you were looking at the oversight. We won’t get into the science of how the virus got out or anything like that. But what were you specifically looking for here in this particular report?\n\nCandice Wright So we were asked to look at the extent to which there was federal funding disbursed to three Chinese entities that included Wuhan University, Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. We were asked to identify if there was any federal funding to those three entities for the time period of calendar year 2014 through 2021. In order to do that work, we actually started with federal databases such as U.S.A. spending, to identify if agencies had made any disbursed funding to either of those three entities.\n\nTom Temin And what did you find?\n\nCandice Wright So in our work, we found that there was one direct award from NIH, The National Institutes of Health made an award directly to Wuhan University for $200,000, where we saw that that amount of money was disbursed. This was the only award that GAO identified that was directly from an agency to one of the three entities. We also identified that there was funding that was made available through seven sub-awards to the three entities, and these totaled over 2.1 million. These sub-awards were from awards that were funded by NIH, as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID.\n\nTom Temin So it’s really then knowledge of the sub-awardees that is of concern here.\n\nCandice Wright Certainly. So there are reporting requirements for federal agencies to provide information on funds that are made to award recipients. That data is usually available in U.S.A. spending. What’s interesting, though, is that the extent of sub-award funding is not fully known. Award recipients are supposed to report data on first year sub-awards. There are some limitations, though, where that information on sub-awards below the first tier or if the sub award is below $30,000 is not required to be reported. We also identified in the course of our work that sometimes it can be difficult to fully understand the extent of funding that’s provided because the funding could have been provided under a different name. And so in two instances we found that there were two sub awards that were made to the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. However, the funds were actually awarded under the name of the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology.\n\nTom Temin We’re speaking with Candice Wright, director for Science, Technology Assessment and Analytics at the Government Accountability Office. So it looks as if China then maybe hides a little bit of who might be getting, which is not really a lot of money in the final analysis here compared to NIH, granting authorities is tens of billions. And this was a couple of million maybe that went to these institutions. So what do these results say to us? What are you recommending?\n\nCandice Wright So the issue of sub-awards and the lack of visibility into them is something that’s been a long standing issue. It’s certainly a known issue in terms of the lack of visibility. And so what’s really important is really for there to be continued focus about how do we ensure that we get visibility into federal funding as it goes, not just said that first award recipient, but as it goes to those lower tiers. In the recommendation that we made, it was really for NIH to think about ways in which it can continue to enhance its oversight of awards, including foreign entities. We thought it was really important that they seek to identify different ways in which they can take immediate action to do so. We recommended that they take a look at their processes, their internal processes for how they oversee awards that involve foreign entities. And this was largely based on the work that we did, but also that of findings from the HHS Office of Inspector General, who had also made recommendations identifying the need to improve and enhance their monitoring of award recipients involving foreign entities.\n\nTom Temin And of that sub-award money that went to the Academy of Military Medical Arts and Sciences of China, who was the primary grant recipient there.\n\nCandice Wright There were two instances where NIH had actually funded an award to Duke University that went to the Academy of Military and Medical Sciences. And then there was also an NIH award to what’s known as the Regents of the University of California that also had a sub-award that was made available to the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. I will note that with respect to the NIH award, to the Regents of the University of California and the sub-award that was then made to the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, it was actually terminated. So there were not actually any funds that were disbursed.\n\nTom Temin Got it. Do you think that is it possible to know whether the regents or Duke University knew who they were actually sending money to? I mean, sometimes China hides entities. They had a police station in the middle of New York City that nobody knew what it was. I mean, they’re pretty good at hiding their identity if they need to.\n\nCandice Wright So I will note these particular awards, we were actually able to identify them in U.S.A. Spending and then did have some interviews with these entities. It certainly does appear that there was knowledge that the funding would be going to these entities based on the documents that we were able to review. Oftentimes, award recipients are expected to include information with respect to what sub-recipients may be receiving federal funding for research.\n\nTom Temin And this might be outside of the scope of your search here. But let me know if it is. But could it be simply that academics and they know other academics in the same field from around the world because they all go to their international meetings all the time, flying into the various capitals throughout Europe, Africa, Asia and so on. And to them, it’s just science to science as colleagues, and they might be not even aware of or just ignoring or naive to the political implications of, say, a sub-grant from a Duke or a Regents of California going to a Chinese military institution.\n\nCandice Wright Well, we’ve certainly seen in our work that when you think about the research in and of itself, it is supposed to be a collaborative endeavor where you’re learning from each other, sharing information. And so given that more collaborative approach, it’s not always the case, perhaps, that researchers might be thinking about some of the national security or other types of implications. And so over the more recent years, there’s definitely been a lot of attention being paid to this issue, really to try to raise awareness from the research community more broadly about the potential for security concerns that they should be mindful of.\n\nTom Temin And the recommendations you made to try to get better visibility into sub-awards deeper and deeper. Did the two agencies agree with you?'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2023/the-national-institutes-of-health-and-ecohealth-alliance-did-not-effectively-monitor-awards-and-subawards-resulting-in-missed-opportunities-to-oversee-research-and-other-deficiencies/', 'Headline': 'Report Materials - Office of Inspector General', 'Snippet': ""The shortcomings we identified related to NIH's oversight of EcoHealth demonstrate continued problems. Compounding these longstanding challenges are risks that may limit effective oversight of foreign subrecipients, which often depends on cooperation between the recipient and subrecipient, and the countries in which the research is performed."", 'Full_text': 'Why OIG Did This Audit\n\nOIG initiated this audit because of concerns regarding the National Institutes of Health\'s (NIH\'s) grant awards to EcoHealth Alliance (EcoHealth), NIH\'s monitoring of EcoHealth, and EcoHealth\'s use of grant funds, including its monitoring of subawards to a foreign entity.\n\nOur objectives were to determine whether: (1) NIH monitored grants to EcoHealth in accordance with Federal requirements and (2) EcoHealth used and managed its NIH grant funds in accordance with Federal requirements.\n\nHow OIG Did This Audit\n\nWe obtained a list of all NIH awards to EcoHealth and all subawards made by EcoHealth during Federal fiscal years 2014 through 2021 (audit period). Our audit covered three NIH awards to EcoHealth totaling approximately $8.0 million, which included $1.8 million of EcoHealth\'s subawards to eight subrecipients, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).\n\nOur audit methodology was designed to address NIH and EcoHealth\'s policies, procedures, and internal controls in place to monitor, manage, and use grant funds. We selected and reviewed 150 EcoHealth transactions totaling $2,578,567 across the 3 NIH awards comprised of different types of cost categories for allowability.\n\nWhat OIG Found\n\nDespite identifying potential risks associated with research being performed under the EcoHealth awards, we found that NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth\'s compliance with some requirements. Although NIH and EcoHealth had established monitoring procedures, we found deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth\'s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action. Using its discretion, NIH did not refer the research to HHS for an outside review for enhanced potential pandemic pathogens (ePPPs) because it determined the research did not involve and was not reasonably anticipated to create, use, or transfer an ePPP. However, NIH added a special term and condition in EcoHealth\'s awards and provided limited guidance on how EcoHealth should comply with that requirement. We found that NIH was only able to conclude that research resulted in virus growth that met specified benchmarks based on a late progress report from EcoHealth that NIH failed to follow up on until nearly 2 years after its due date. Based on these findings, we conclude that NIH missed opportunities to more effectively monitor research. With improved oversight, NIH may have been able to take more timely corrective actions to mitigate the inherent risks associated with this type of research.\n\nWe identified several other deficiencies in the oversight of the awards. Some of these deficiencies include: NIH\'s improper termination of a grant; EcoHealth\'s inability to obtain scientific documentation from WIV; and EcoHealth\'s improper use of grant funds, resulting in $89,171 in unallowable costs.\n\nOIG oversight work has continually demonstrated that grant-awarding agencies\' oversight of subrecipients, whether domestic or foreign, is challenging. The shortcomings we identified related to NIH\'s oversight of EcoHealth demonstrate continued problems. Compounding these longstanding challenges are risks that may limit effective oversight of foreign subrecipients, which often depends on cooperation between the recipient and subrecipient, and the countries in which the research is performed. Although WIV cooperated with EcoHealth\'s monitoring for several years, WIV\'s lack of cooperation following the COVID 19 outbreak limited EcoHealth\'s ability to monitor its subrecipient. NIH should assess how it can best mitigate these issues and ensure that it can oversee the use of NIH funds by foreign recipients and subrecipients.\n\nWe recommend that NIH ensure that EcoHealth accurately and in a timely manner report award and subaward information; ensure that administrative actions are appropriately performed; implement enhanced monitoring, documentation, and reporting requirements for recipients with foreign subrecipients; assess whether NIAID staff are following policy to err on the side of inclusion when determining whether to refer research that may involve ePPP for further review; consider whether it is appropriate to refer WIV to HHS for debarment; ensure any future NIH grant awards to EcoHealth address the deficiencies noted in the report; and resolve costs identified as unallowable as well as possibly unreimbursed costs.\n\nIn written comments, NIH stated that it concurred or generally concurred with our recommendations, and provided actions taken or planned to address them, which are more fully described in the report.\n\nWe recommend EcoHealth submit progress reports by the required due date, comply with immediate notification requirements, ensure access to all subrecipient records, properly account for subawards, and refund to the Federal Government $89,171 in unallowable costs.\n\nIn written comments, EcoHealth concurred with our recommendation to prepare accurate subaward and consultant agreements but did not directly state whether it concurred with the other recommendations. EcoHealth identified two substantive areas of disagreement with the reported findings: (1) the timeliness of EcoHealth\'s Year 5 progress report and (2) whether an experiment exhibited enhanced virus growth. Regarding the nine monetary recommendations, EcoHealth stated that it reimbursed NIH for the total reported unallowable costs and provided NIH with details on the amounts of allowable but unreimbursed costs. However, EcoHealth disagreed with OIG\'s interpretation of Federal requirements for some items of cost.\n\nWith respect to EcoHealth\'s comments regarding the timeliness of EcoHealth\'s Year 5 progress report, we have no evidence that the progress report, which was initiated on NIH\'s online portal in July 2019, was fully uploaded to the online portal at that time. Regarding the finding that an experiment exhibited ""enhanced growth,"" our audit did not assess scientific results for any of the experiments or make any determination regarding the accuracy of NIH\'s or EcoHealth\'s interpretations of the Years 4 and 5 research results. Our audit found that NIH\'s own evaluation of the Year 5 progress report concluded that the research was of a type that should have been reported immediately to NIH.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/us-government-bans-wuhan-lab-from-federal-funding/4017756.article', 'Headline': 'US government bans Wuhan lab from federal funding', 'Snippet': 'US government bans Wuhan lab from federal funding. By Rebecca Trager 2023-07-24T14:35:00+01:00. ... recently released by an oversight committee of the US House of Representatives, noted ...', 'Full_text': 'The Biden administration has banned the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China from receiving US federal funding after concluding that research there that had been financed by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) likely violated biosafety protocols. Earlier this month, the NIH’s parent agency the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that ‘the immediate suspension of WIV is necessary to mitigate any potential public health risk’.\n\nWIV has been at the centre of unproven claims that the virus that caused the Covid-19 pandemic escaped from its labs. This latest development exacerbates the drama surrounding the US government’s support of coronavirus research in China prior to the outbreak.\n\nThe WIV research in question, originally awarded funding by the NIH in 2014 and renewed in 2019, was channelled through the New York-based non-profit EcoHealth Alliance. EcoHealth received approximately $600,000 (£467,000) for the project, which involved studying coronaviruses in bats and their potential to jump into humans. The project, which was cancelled in April 2020, was originally funded by the Obama administration. It had come under public attack from Republican politicians in the weeks preceding its termination.\n\nHHS does not argue that the project caused the Covid-19 outbreak, but it does criticise WIV for refusing to share certain information relating to its research.\n\nThe HHS memo, recently released by an oversight committee of the US House of Representatives, noted that the NIH determined in an August 2021 review that the WIV research may have yielded an increase in viral activity that violated the terms of the NIH grant. There was no evidence that EcoHealth had notified the NIH about this possibility as it was required to do, according to HHS.\n\n‘NIH has given WIV several opportunities to disprove this finding, but WIV has failed to do so,’ HHS stated. ‘Due to WIV’s disregard of the NIH’s requests … the NIH’s conclusion that WIV research likely violated protocols of the NIH regarding biosafety is undisputed.’\n\nEcoHealth contends that any increase in viral activity was ‘not statistically significant’, and argues that it had reported the results of its experiments in line with NIH’s requirements.\n\nIn a statement to Chemistry World, EcoHealth says that: ‘The [HHS] claim that there was no evidence that EHA notified NIH about the experiment in question is not correct. EcoHealth Alliance provided the Government Accountability Office with documentation regarding this alleged late reporting that showed the experimental results were first reported in the Year 4 report, which was submitted into the NIH system on time in April 2018, with a copy emailed to the NIAID Program Officer at that time.’\n\nEcoHealth had described the goal of the NIH-funded project as constructing Mers and Mers-like chimeric coronaviruses in order to understand the potential origins of Mers in bats.\n\nWhen NIH abruptly terminated the WIV research in 2020, there was worry that political pressure had motivated the decision. At the time, 77 US Nobel laureates and more than 30 scientific societies including the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology expressed concerns about the decision. The NIH reinstated a diminished version of the grant earlier this year, which no longer includes the involvement of WIV.\n\nThis story was updated on 26 July to include comments from EcoHealth Alliance.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/01/27/1151867224/virologists-science-oversight-risky-experiments', 'Headline': 'Government officials are thinking of increasing oversight of risky ...', 'Snippet': 'The origins of the pandemic.

This process currently weighs the risks and benefits of experiments that might change ""potential pandemic pathogens"" in ways that could make them more dangerous.\n\nTheir advice will now get considered by officials at multiple agencies and groups across the government who will want to weigh in, including the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Security Council.\n\n""This will be a deliberative process,"" says Lawrence Tabak, who is performing the duties of the director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nHe says it\'s not clear yet how many NIH-funded research projects might be affected. ""We have not yet formally begun to do that analysis,"" Tabak says. ""We just received these recommendations today.""\n\nIt\'s that kind of uncertainty that makes infectious disease experts nervous. But some see the proposed changes as a real step forward.\n\n""The government really has a strong interest on behalf of all of us, in the public, in knowing when researchers want to make a virus more lethal or more transmissible, and understanding how that would be done and why that would be done, and whether the benefits are worth it,"" says Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nThe origins of the pandemic\n\nAll of this comes as the lab in China, known as the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is again in the headlines. An internal government watchdog released a report this week criticizing the National Institutes of Health, saying it failed to adequately monitor grant awards given to a nonprofit that had collaborated with scientists at the Wuhan lab.\n\nFelicia Goodrum, a virologist at the University of Arizona, says that open-minded experts have investigated the origins of the pandemic. The available evidence, she says, supports the notion that the virus emerged from nature just like other viruses such as HIV and Ebola did — by jumping from animals into people who had contact with them.\n\n""The evidence that we have to date suggests that SARS-CoV-2 entered the human population by that route,"" says Goodrum. ""There is no evidence to the contrary or in support of a lab leak, nothing credible.""\n\nBasic research on viruses, she says, is what led to the swift development of vaccines and drugs to fight the pandemic.\n\nAnd yet virologists have watched in dismay as misinformation and conspiracy theories have placed the blame on science.\n\n""There\'s this complete disconnect between reality and what happened,"" says Michael Imperiale, a virologist at the University of Michigan.\n\nHe says that while debates have gone on for years about the wisdom of doing experiments that might make bad viruses even worse, this moment feels different.\n\n""The pandemic,"" he says, ""has really kind of heightened the urgency with which we need to address these issues, just because of all the controversy that\'s been out there regarding, you know, was this a lab leak or not?""\n\nA bird flu study raises alarm\n\nUnlike, say, nuclear physics research, biology has traditionally had a culture of openness. After the anthrax attacks in 2001, however, biologists began to grapple with the possibility that their published work might serve as recipes for evildoers who wanted to make bioweapons.\n\nAnd in 2011, there was an outcry after government-funded researchers altered a bird flu virus that can be deadly in people. Their lab work made this virus more contagious in the lab animals that are stand-ins for people.\n\nCritics said they\'d created a super flu. Proponents said that viruses sometimes have to be manipulated in the lab to see what they might be capable of; in nature, after all, mutations occur all the time and that is how pandemic strains emerge.\n\nThat episode marked the start of a long, heated debate, plus research moratoriums and ultimately the development of new regulations. In 2017, a review system was put into place to weigh the risks and benefits of studies that might make a potential pandemic pathogen even worse. So far just three proposed lines of research, with influenza viruses, have been deemed risky enough to merit that kind of extra scrutiny.\n\n""We are really talking about a small amount of research proposals,"" says Lyric Jorgenson, the acting associate director for science policy and the acting director of the Office of Science Policy at the NIH.\n\nShe says just before the pandemic started, officials asked advisors on the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity to consider whether the government needed to be more transparent to the public about how it was making decisions about this kind of research. Before that work was done, the pandemic hit and everything was put on hold. Last year, officials asked the group to evaluate the regulations more comprehensively.\n\nIf the proposed changes developed by this advisory group are eventually adopted by the government, an extra layer of oversight would apply to any study ""reasonably anticipated"" to enhance the transmission or virulence of any pathogen in a way that could make it a public health threat. That means more experiments on more viruses would get a closer look.\n\n""What this new recommendation is saying, is that even if you start with a virus that had no potential to cause an epidemic or pandemic, if you are doing research that will change that virus in a way where it could now cause an uncontrollable disease, or a widely spreading disease, that has to be reviewed by this new framework,"" says Inglesby.\n\nWhat\'s more, the advisory group has noted that ""increased transparency in the review process is needed to engender public trust in the review and oversight processes.""\n\nWhat\'s \'Reasonably Anticipated\'\n\nThe American Society for Microbiology responded positively, saying ""we urge swift implementation of the recommended changes by the federal agencies engaged in this work.""\n\nBut some virologists think the devil will be in the details if these recommendations turn into policy.\n\n""They keep using this phrase \'reasonably anticipated,\'"" says Imperiale. ""How is that going to be interpreted? Is there going to be clear guidance as to what is meant by that?""\n\nResearchers often don\'t know what will happen when they start an experiment, says Goodrum, especially when the science is cutting-edge.\n\n""That\'s where the big scientific advancements come from. And so to tie our hands behind our back, to say we can only do the science that we can anticipate, then we\'re really restricting innovative science,"" she says.\n\nRon Fouchier, the virologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, whose lab did the bird flu experiments over a decade ago, said in an email that he\'d hoped the experience of going through a pandemic would simulate more research, not ""unnecessarily delay or restrict it.""\n\nHe said it looked like many infectious disease researchers in the United States ""will face substantial delays in their crucial research efforts, if they can continue that research at all.""\n\nThe U.S. is unusual in that it has a lot of public discussion of these issues and a system to try to manage the risks, says Inglesby.\n\nHe thinks that oversight can be made stronger without getting in the way of science.\n\n""I am avidly, absolutely pro-science and pro-research, and in particular pro-infectious disease research,"" says Inglesby.\n\nBut he says there\'s a very small part of that research ""where there is the potential for very high risk if things go wrong, either by accident or on purpose. And so we have to get the balance right, between the risks that could unfold and the potential benefits.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://thebulletin.org/2022/08/nih-to-terminate-ecohealth-alliance-grant-after-its-wuhan-partners-refuse-to-deliver-information-on-coronavirus-studies/', 'Headline': 'NIH to terminate part of EcoHealth Alliance grant after its Wuhan ...', 'Snippet': 'In an Aug. 19 letter to Kentucky Rep James Comer, the top Republican member of the US House Oversight Committee, Michael Lauer, the deputy director of extramural research at NIH, said the agency had informed EcoHealth that it was terminating the sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology “for failure to meet award terms and conditions ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institute of Health (NIH) is partially terminating a grant to a nonprofit that worked extensively with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on bat coronavirus research.

The agency then asked for lab notebooks and other files pertaining to the experiments, and EcoHealth reported that it would relay the request to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the new NIH letters, the Wuhan institute never delivered.\n\n“NIH has requested on two occasions that [EcoHealth] provide NIH the laboratory notebooks and original electronic files from the research conducted at [the Wuhan Institute of Virology]. To date, [the institute] has not provided these records,” Lauer told Comer. NIH verified to the Bulletin that the letters were authentic.\n\nA letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide the requested records, and [EcoHealth’s] failure to include the required terms in [the] subaward agreement represent material failures to comply with the terms of award,” the letter said.\n\nBetween June 2017 and May 2019, scientists working on EcoHealth’s grant tested genetically engineered coronaviruses with the backbone of one virus and the spike proteins—which bind to host cells—of another on mice that expressed human cell receptors. In one case, the NIH reported last fall, one of the chimeric viruses caused mice to become “sicker.” EcoHealth reports show that in the infection experiments, conducted in years four and five of the grant, chimeric viruses replicated faster in mice lungs and killed a higher percentage of mice than the unmodified virus. Last fall, the NIH said that EcoHealth was supposed to report the increased viral growth to the agency “immediately” to assess whether further biosafety measures were necessary.\n\nThe NIH said the Wuhan institute’s experiments under the EcoHealth grant involved viruses that were too genetically distant to have evolved to become SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But some critics of so-called gain-of-function experimentation—in which pathogens are enhanced in way that makes them, say, more transmissible—have said last fall’s revelations point to risky research projects being undertaken at the laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the first reported cases of COVID were reported. Research published recently in Science points to the pandemic having sprung from a seafood market in the city where animals that could have harbored coronavirus infections were kept. That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth has not responded to a request for comment about NIH’s decision to partially terminate its grant.\n\nAccording to the new NIH letters, EcoHealth can work with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to revise the grants without involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If that is not possible, the NIH will ask that the grant be “bilaterally terminated.” Should a reworked grant be possible, the agency will add new terms to it, including increased NIH oversight over EcoHealth for at least three years and increased reporting requirements for the nonprofit. The nonprofit will also be required to visit its sub-awardees every six months to ensure compliance with the grant.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/science/nih-ecohealth-coronavirus-lab-leak.html', 'Headline': 'N.I.H.

However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.\n\nIn Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations.\n\nIt marked the most significant moment so far in the country\'s slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.\n\nLatin America\n\nLatin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.\n\nMexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.\n\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world\'s second-highest official death toll.\n\nIn Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world\'s highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.\n\nAfrica\n\nAfrica has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\n\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths.\n\nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.\n\nMiddle East\n\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.\n\nThe official death toll in Iran, the region\'s worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases.\n\nNeighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.\n\nIn January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country.\n\nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.\n\nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\n\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.\n\nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\n\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\n\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country\'s elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\n\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University.

Because most coronavirus vaccines require two doses, many countries also report the number of people who have received just one dose and the number who have been fully vaccinated.\n\nMany of the charts on this page show the number of people who have received at least one dose of a vaccine, which can offer significant protection against severe disease and reduce the risk of transmission, according to some studies.\n\nIf a country only reports the number of doses they have administered in total, we do not know the number of people who have been vaccinated. Those countries are excluded from our charts and statistics about people vaccinated.\n\nHow fast are countries vaccinating?\n\nDo some countries have an advantage?\n\nYes, generally richer and more developed countries have better health care infrastructure to manufacture, acquire and administer doses.\n\nAbout 24 % of people who have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine were from high income countries, and at least 0 % were from Europe and North America. (Again, that only includes data from countries that report these figures.)\n\nShow by\n\nWho is getting vaccinated?\n\nBecause of the limited availability of vaccines, most countries are prioritizing certain groups of people to receive their shots before others. People who are older or more likely to become very ill or die from COVID-19 are usually prioritized over those who are young and healthy. Some groups are prioritized because they are more likely to come into contact with an infected person based on what they do or where they live and, in turn, infect others.\n\nReuters has collected information on these priority groups for dozens of countries and determined which groups are currently eligible for vaccination.\n\nTap through the table below to see detailed information for each country.

""If a person wanted to be vaccinated, that person would have to go to the south. So drive around 15 to 20 hours crossing front lines in the mountains."" Even then, after such a treacherous journey through a war zone, it\'s not clear if doses would be available. Like many low-income countries, Yemen has struggled to get hold of vaccine.\n\nLoading...\n\n""Yemen has been one of the places with the lowest vaccination rates in the world,"" says Lavoie. ""And that\'s despite the fact that we\'ve experienced three waves of COVID."" Currently fewer than 2% of Yemenis are fully vaccinated.\n\nYemen is one of 36 countries that fall below the 10% immunization threshold, some with rates under 2%. Much of the mid-section of Africa is in that category, including powerful economic and political players like Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nBy contrast, many wealthy countries have fully vaccinated more than 80% of their citizens.\n\nWhy Africa lags so far behind\n\nMaaza Seyoum with the African Alliance, a South Africa-based advocacy group, says there are many factors playing in to the low vaccination rates in many countries on the continent but the biggest issue is simply that African nations have struggled to get doses.\n\n""Initially, 100 percent, I would say the problem was a lack of access (to vaccines) and a global system that did not prioritize African countries,"" Maaza says. Wealthy nations bought up far more pharmaceutical firms vaccine production than they could even use. The WHO-backed COVAX program faltered as it relied heavily on voluntary donations and on manufacturers in India who were blocked from exporting doses when COVID case numbers skyrocketed on the sub-continent. Some African countries managed to get supplies from China but Beijing often prioritized donations to wealthier trading partners.\n\nThat situation has changed, says Maaza. Recently vaccine deliveries to Africa have increased. But now there are new problems: the shipments are haphazard and sometimes consist of less popular brands that are about to expire.\n\n""Now we\'re seeing the sort of drip, drip, drip of vaccines,"" she says. ""People are waiting for vaccines to come. They come, then they stop.""\n\nThis unpredictable supply chain, she says, makes it nearly impossible for African countries to plan nationwide vaccination drives. And in some of these places where hardly anyone has gotten the jab, rumors about the mysterious vaccine have flourished and augmented vaccine hesitancy.\n\n""The truth is, there is vaccine hesitancy everywhere,"" Maaza says. ""But as people are waiting, it leaves kind of a fertile ground for these rumors to circulate.""\n\nWhich makes convincing people to come to a clinic and get immunized even more of a challenge.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhat\'s behind those under 10% vaccination numbers\n\nThe World Health Organization set a goal of trying to push all countries to 40% vaccine coverage by the end of 2021. The 36 countries still under 10% obviously didn\'t even get close. Kate O\'Brien, the director of immunization and vaccines for the World Health Organization, says this is a significant problem.\n\n""For countries that are struggling to get even above 10%, what this means is that health-care workers are not fully vaccinated yet,"" she says. ""It means older age populations, those who have underlying medical conditions, the people at highest risk are not fully protected yet.""\n\nShe acknowledges vaccine supply inequity as a major part of why rates are so low in these three dozen countries but says there are other reasons too. Many of these countries had health systems that were struggling even before the pandemic to meet local medical needs. Some of them have needed to upgrade refrigeration systems to be able to store certain mRNA vaccines at extremely low temperatures. Others need syringes. All of this takes money that many low-income nations health ministries may not have.\n\n""A COVID vaccine campaign does require funding,"" O\'Brien says. Countries need money ""to deploy new health workers and to assure that the clinics have the resources that they need.""\n\nAnd while there has been some international assistance to lower-income nations to help, that financing has also at times been haphazard and unpredictable.\n\nOngoing conflicts present another obstacle\n\nAway from Africa, the other nations that haven\'t yet gotten above 10% COVID vaccine coverage are some of the most troubled in the world, including Yemen as well as Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti.\n\nCurrently the armed conflict has displaced 4 million of 30 million Yemenis from their homes. Various groups control different parts of the country. According to the U.N. more than 2/3rds of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance. Yet international aid agencies have struggled to meet those needs and keep their operations running in the country due to the ongoing insecurity and a lack of funding.\n\nFor most people in Yemen, life is incredibly difficult. COVID vaccinations are ""not on the top of the list of priorities for many people in Yemen,"" Jasmin Lavoie with NRC says. He says most Yemenis spend their days trying to find food, shelter, decent toilets and worrying about whether they\'ll have to flee fighting once again. ""These are reasons why people are not getting vaccinated too,"" he adds.\n\nThere are similar issues in other conflict zones. ""In a place like Afghanistan, in a place like Syria, COVID is not their number one priority,"" says Paul Spiegel, who runs the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSpiegel returned to Baltimore from working in Afghanistan in mid-December. ""[Vaccination] campaigns are happening,"" he says but adds that the immunization drives are constrained by the limited shipments of vaccine. ""A fair bit of it is Johnson and Johnson, which makes a lot of sense in Afghanistan situation because it\'s just one dose,"" he notes.\n\nBut similar to Yemen, the social upheaval in Afghanistan, with the U.S. departing and the Taliban returning to power, has pushed COVID to the backburner. Vaccine drives are not a top priority for the Taliban, even though it has said it supports vaccination drives by COVAX and the U.N.\n\nNor is it a priority among Afghans.

As of 15 June 2022, 37 COVID-19 vaccines were in Phase 3 clinical trials, authorized for early use or approved for full use (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html), with some available for use in infants as young as 6 months old1,2. Eleven vaccines have now been given Emergency Use Listing (EUL) from the World Health Organization (WHO)3, and more than 11.9 billion (as of 15 June 2022, https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL) COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered worldwide4,5,6. Nonetheless, more than 30% of the world population remains unvaccinated3, and COVID-19 vaccines and public health measures to promote them have generated substantial political controversy in many countries7.\n\nGiven that vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases will continue to play a critical role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and future diseases, there is an enormous need to better understand both how governments use vaccines and the factors that drive or inhibit uptake. Within the latter, the policies and measures that governments adopt to promote vaccination play an important role. This resource article introduces a new dataset from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) project8 that provides cross-national and longitudinal information on COVID-19 vaccination policies across the world. The new dataset covers vaccine prioritization policies (V1), vaccine availability and eligibility by group (V2), whether there is a cost to individual recipients at the point of use (V3) and mandate policies (V4) (Table 1). Developed in consultation with governments, policymakers, stakeholders in the field and the OxCGRT expert advisory board, this dataset allows researchers and policymakers to systematically compare government vaccination strategies and assess distributional capabilities (see Methods for more information on dataset design). Through combination with other datasets, further analyses, such as on the impact of distribution policies on uptake, are made possible.\n\nThe dataset is composed of four indicators that report national-level COVID-19 vaccination policies for 52 population categories from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022 for 185 jurisdictions in the national database, as well as subnational jurisdictions (provinces) for Canada and (states) for the United States (subnational-jurisdiction data for other countries are in development and will be added to the online data repository as they become available). Collected by a specially trained team of OxCGRT volunteer data contributors, the dataset has been reviewed for quality assurance and accuracy by core OxCGRT researchers and a specially trained review team. The results presented here focus only on the national-level data. The 52 population categories include general and at-risk age groups (in 5-yr intervals for individuals over 16 yr), occupational categories (based on exposure and transmission risk and economic function—groups of people working in occupations critical to the economic function of the country, including essential workers and airport/border staff) and medical categories (based on vulnerability) (Table 2). These closely reflect the categories listed in the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) values framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, a framework that guides the allocation of vaccinations under limited supply to specific population groups to meet specific outcomes.\n\nHere we present some variations and temporal patterns of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization, eligibility, distribution, cost and mandates by group, with the aim of illustrating how the new dataset can offer insights for researchers and policymakers. By mapping variation in vaccination policies over time, this dataset provides a means of responding to critical questions about the role of vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic. The four indicators are presented in the dataset alongside vaccination rates so that users can easily generate cross-national and within-country comparisons to explore associations between vaccination policies, those prioritized for vaccination and vaccine uptake. The dataset’s jurisdiction–day format purposefully facilitates merging with other data sources. For example, combining these four vaccine policy indicators with data about other kinds of pandemic policies—relating to closures, economic support and health, such as testing—allows for assessment of the interplay of vaccination programmes within the broader context of pandemic management. Combining these data with other social science indicators broadens the possibilities further, towards considerations of the impacts of vaccination policies in different economic, political, cultural or religious contexts, and how controversies towards COVID-19 vaccines may have shaped policy. Comparisons between countries with similar demographics, or those with unique demographics and geography might highlight best practice for future pandemics10.\n\nTo motivate use of this new dataset, in this section we illustrate some initial observations using the four vaccine policy indicators. First, we focus on the first two indicators (V1 and V2). We note common patterns in vaccination prioritization strategies according to the broader strategies guiding countries’ pandemic management, and by country income level. We then observe country-level variation in both prioritization and actual distribution by age group and other kinds of vulnerability categories. Second, we consider the additional two indicators (V3 and V4), briefly discussing the cost of vaccination to individuals, before exploring vaccine mandate policies. Although we find limited variation relating to cost across countries—almost all countries provided the vaccine to people free of charge—we detail the diversity of countries’ vaccine mandate policies, ranging from non-existent, to policies specific to certain age groups, occupation groups and populations carrying out specific religious activities, or working in named locations.\n\nComparing countries’ prioritization plans\n\nThe vaccine prioritization (V1) indicator captures the order in which governments planned to deploy COVID-19 vaccines to different categories of people. It depicts the published plans of all countries in the OxCGRT dataset (only Eritrea, of 185 countries, has yet to begin COVID-19 vaccinations or publish a vaccination plan). These plans were primarily used to ration limited supplies at a time when global vaccine supply was constrained. As such, they help reveal the evolving priorities governments held for vaccine deployment.\n\nBroadly, we can distinguish two ideal typical COVID-19 strategies: elimination and mitigation. Roughly, studies have categorized these strategies by observing how eliminators aimed to keep the virus out of the country and to prevent community transmission. In contrast, mitigators sought to reduce the impact of community transmission by flattening the curve and reducing cases and deaths11,12,13,14. Many countries in the WHO West Pacific Region adopted policies closer to the elimination model, perhaps in part due to the region’s previous experience with SARS11,13. Relatedly, it has also been hypothesized that island nations may have been more likely to pursue elimination models during COVID-19 due to their geographical advantage of isolation and ability to seal national borders, although for many low-income countries (LICs) and LMICs, this came at appreciable economic cost11,15,16,17,18. Finally, early responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have also highlighted distinctions between mitigation and elimination strategies based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, such as high-performing surveillance systems with early and targeted contact tracing and widespread efficient testing in eliminator countries12,14.\n\nInterestingly, we observe a clear distinction in the vaccination rollout strategies of countries that have been characterized as pursuing an elimination strategy throughout much of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to countries that pursued a mitigation strategy11,12,13,14,19. Table 3 highlights how nine selected eliminators (selected as examples from a comprehensive list of eliminators, see Supplementary Table 3), such as Australia and New Zealand, prioritized frontline workers and border staff alongside clinically vulnerable people (those with co-morbidities and/or predispositions to illness) in their first rounds of vaccination (that is, positioned rank 1), while nine selected mitigators (see Supplementary Table 3 for comprehensive list of mitigators) focused instead on vaccinating only clinically vulnerable and elderly populations, along with healthcare workers. Looking across all countries in our dataset, while 11 out of 19 (58%) Western Pacific countries prioritized first-round vaccinations on the basis of economic function, only 42 out of 164 (26%) non-Western Pacific countries did so. When looking at the OECD subset, we observe the same pattern: 2 out of 5 countries that adopted elimination in the early stages of the pandemic (40%) prioritized vaccination on the basis of economic function versus 4 out of 32 (12%) mitigators. Finally, the same descriptive pattern holds for island nations (16 out of 32, 50%) when contrasted to non-island nations, with 16 (50%) island countries adopting economic function prioritized vaccination versus non-island countries (38 out of 151, 25%). In contrast, only 3 Western Pacific countries (16%) prioritized clinically vulnerable people, versus 80 (49%) for countries outside the region. However, we observe no differences in descriptive patterns for either OECD or island country groupings. While 3 out of 5 OECD countries that adopted elimination strategies in the early stages of the pandemic (60%) prioritized clinically vulnerable people, 19 out of 32 mitigators did so. Finally, 44% of island (14 out of 32) and 46% of non-island countries (70 out of 151) prioritized clinically vulnerable people.\n\nWhen we map country differences in the most- (or equal-most-) prioritized categories of people (Fig. 1), we observe that almost all countries in our dataset placed healthcare workers among the first to receive COVID-19 vaccines (91% of countries, or 168/185) presumably both to reduce transmission and mitigate health impacts for those at high risk of exposure. Following healthcare workers, 54% (101) of countries also prioritized populations deemed to be clinically vulnerable. Seventy-four countries (40%) prioritized groups of people critical to the economic function of the country, 45 prioritized (24%) categories related to the public function of the country, and 27 countries (15%) focused on educators and/or students for COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nComparing countries’ plans with actual distribution\n\nBy the end of 2021, 62 (34%) countries had published COVID-19 vaccination rollout plans and prioritization lists, often with rough estimates for the timing of each phase. Of those, 48 countries began vaccination before the end of 2021 (Fig. 2), and by 31 March 2021, 107 more countries had published their COVID-19 vaccination plans and priorities. In countries with access to vaccines, deployment swiftly followed plans (captured by indicator V2, which records the groups actually receiving a vaccine in a country). Because vaccine access was highly related to countries’ income levels20, Fig. 2 groups countries according to the World Bank income classification groups for 2021 (https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html). HICs were the first to publish vaccination plans to secure COVID-19 vaccines and to begin administration of vaccines for their populations, reflecting their greater ability to produce and purchase vaccines. Figure 2 shows that the publication of plans and subsequent administration of vaccine doses then followed in upper middle-income countries (UMICs), LMICs and then LICs, respectively. HICs moved quicker to expand vaccination eligibility to the 12+ yr age group than LMICs. It also shows that despite publishing plans and beginning vaccinations at later dates than HICs and UMICs, some LMICs and LICs quickly moved from prioritized vaccinations by age or occupation to universal access (defined in our dataset as being available widely to all those over the age of 16+ yr or 18+ yr, with age floor dependent on vaccine brand). LMICs and LICs have had far fewer vaccine doses available to them than HICs and UMICs (https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/accessibility/), so one possible explanation for the swift movement towards universal access in LICs and LMICs may be an attempt to vaccinate larger proportions of their populations in the face of vaccine hesitancy. However, there are conflicting views on whether LMICs and LICs are more or less vaccine hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccines than HICs and UMICs21,22,23. Another possible explanation for the quick move to (ostensibly) universal access (despite low vaccine supply) may have been to reduce public perception of favouring or excluding certain groups in the face of a public health emergency and with varying social and geographic challenges in the distribution of vaccines24,25.\n\nComparing categories by age and vulnerability status\n\nOnly 11 countries in our dataset did not specifically prioritize elderly populations (the age cut-off for ‘elderly’ is defined locally, see Methods) in their plans and rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Macau, Namibia, Russia, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Uruguay, Zimbabwe and Taiwan). Long-term care facilities (LTCFs; nursing homes, elderly care homes and so on) are a concept and cultural phenomenon predominantly found in some relatively wealthy countries26. This is reflected in our data (Fig. 3), with most African, South Asian and Middle East countries not prioritizing LTCFs in their plans and rollouts. In contrast, while not prioritizing its elderly population in general, Russia did prioritize vaccinations at LTCFs for elderly people before moving to universal eligibility.\n\nAt the younger end of the age scale, children and infants were not included in initial COVID-19 prioritization plans and indeed, the WHO stated that children were a lower priority group as they are less likely to experience serious symptoms27. Clinical research into the safety and efficacy of vaccines in children came later28. Because clinical trials split children into groups of young children (~5–11 yr,) and adolescents (~12–17 yr)29, many countries’ regulatory agencies approved COVID-19 vaccines for children in similar age groups at around the same time as research emerged and as vaccine supplies allowed (Fig. 2). Children 12 and above first became eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations on 6 May 2021 in the territory of Nunavut, Canada, and Bahrain made the COVID-19 vaccine available to children aged 3+ yr on 17 August 2021. As of 15 June 2022, only 12 countries were vaccinating infants (children aged 0–4 yr), 6 being Central and South American countries (Fig. 3), and 26 countries in our dataset have not been recorded as vaccinating children or infants (ages 0–15 yr).\n\nCountries prioritized many professional categories, some of which (for example, healthcare workers) were gendered to varying extents in different countries. Pregnant people were first made eligible for vaccinations in 2021. They were not initially prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination due to a lack of clinical trial data on the effect on unborn children and pregnant people. From January 2020 to 15 June 2022, 21 countries explicitly prioritized pregnant people in their official vaccination rollout plans (V1) (Fig. 4), and 54 out of 185 countries reported specifically administering vaccinations to pregnant people during their vaccination rollouts (V2).\n\nSimilarly, strikingly few countries have prioritized refugees, migrants and ethnic minorities in their COVID-19 vaccination plans or actual rollouts (Fig. 4), despite reports of disparities in the risk of COVID-19 infections and in health outcomes among these groups30,31,32,33,34. Australia, Brazil, Canada and New Zealand all prioritized Indigenous populations in their plans and administration of COVID-19 vaccines (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, Indigenous People, traditional riverine and quilombola communities in Brazil, First Nations in Canada, Māori and Pacific People and their extended families/whanau that care for them in New Zealand). In early June 2021, Greece began a vaccination programme specifically for refugees starting with the island refugee camps, then moving to the mainland camps. Some African countries with high rates of internal migration have prioritized the vaccination of migrants and ‘travellers’ (a term sometimes used for migrants) (Fig. 4)(https://africacenter.org/spotlight/african-migration-trends-to-watch-in-2022/). Many other countries may have made COVID-19 vaccines available to refugees and migrants but may not have explicitly noted this in official documentation.\n\nVaccine cost and mandates\n\nThe dataset reveals that nearly all countries provided the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge to individuals at the point of delivery (V3). From data freely available online from government sources, we observed that Botswana, India, Pakistan and Turkmenistan required a small fee for COVID-19 vaccination from individuals, in some circumstances. In Taiwan, vaccines were free for those meeting eligibility criteria, but individuals could self-fund vaccination in advance of becoming eligible for free vaccines. Some countries enabled individuals to acquire the vaccination privately if they wished or encouraged vaccine tourism in efforts to boost tourism during the pandemic. In late 2021, Russian tourists were accessing free non-Sputnik vaccines in Croatia via specially arranged tours35. Not long after, Russia began to offer their Sputnik COVID-19 vaccine at a cost to tourists (although visas to visit the country were an issue for some)36. Cities and states of the United States, Indonesia, Cuba, the Maldives and the UAE began to use free COVID-19 vaccinations to increase tourism, and travel agencies in the United Kingdom, India and the United States (among others) offered package deals for individuals not yet eligible in their own country to access the vaccine in another37,38,39. These cases are not recorded in our V3 ordinal indicator data but are captured in qualitative coding notes within the dataset.\n\nWe define mandatory COVID-19 vaccination as a government policy requirement to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to work in a specific occupation, or for a specific age group of citizens to be vaccinated. We see these policies as distinct from COVID-19 passports or certification to gain entry to non-essential services or for international travel based on demonstrating immunity or negative test results. These ‘passport’ style policies are defined in the OxCGRT database as ‘differentiated policies’ and are part of the OxCGRT Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) dataset8,40. For 10 of these original indicators, we report two policies, one for vaccinated and another for non-vaccinated individuals, viewing requirements to present passes as a de facto closure (see online documentation and Methods for further detail).\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine mandates (V4) were first introduced in Jakarta, Indonesia, in February 2021 for all adults41. As of 15 June 2022, 55 countries (29%) of our dataset have currently, or had at one time, at least one vaccine mandate policy. Figure 5 shows that mandatory vaccination policies accelerated in implementation around July 2021, commonly according to occupation (83%), with age-based mandates being far less widespread (17%).\n\nThe most common groups to have been mandated for COVID-19 vaccination were related to occupation: government officials (36), healthcare workers (29), staff at LTCFs (15) and educators (22). Hence, in most countries, mandates only affected a small and specific proportion of the population, as opposed to COVID-19 passports which affected the whole population to control their access to services. Six countries (Germany, Ethiopia, Kuwait, New Zealand, Russia and Tonga) mandated vaccines for socially vulnerable and or other vulnerable populations (see Table 2). Nine countries, including Indonesia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan mandated COVID-19 vaccination for the entire adult population. Ecuador mandated vaccination for all those over 5 yr and in Costa Rica, all those aged 3–18 yr must be vaccinated (""×"" symbol in Fig. 5). The qualitative notes section of this new vaccine dataset records how some countries introduced specific vaccine mandates for particular groups relevant to their local context, such as those observing the Hajj in Saudi Arabia, Jahh in Bangladesh, and maritime and port workers in Singapore.\n\nIn this section we describe the design, structure, collection, publication and review of the panel dataset of COVID-19 vaccine policies, with the jurisdiction–day as the unit of analysis. All OxCGRT data are available on GitHub and are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution CC BY standard. Data users should refer to the project website for updated documentation and methodologies (https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker). Excel (v.16), Stata (v.17.0) and R (v.4.1.3) software were used for all analysis and images produced in this resource article.\n\nIndicators\n\nIn late 2020, the OxCGRT team began to consider the COVID-19 vaccine policies and strategies that might be deployed globally. Extensive consultations with government officials, policymakers, experts and stakeholders in the relevant fields, consideration of critical gaps in existing data at the time, and capacity to collect such information resulted in a focus on four priority policies to measure (vaccine indicators V1–V4): who was prioritized for vaccines, who was eligible and receiving vaccines and in what order, who was paying for vaccines, and who was mandated to be vaccinated. Additional indicators for future consideration could include which vaccines were approved/deployed in each country, prioritization for additional/booster vaccinations, vaccine dose timing (manufacturer recommendations vs timeline chosen by country for subsequent doses), government vaccination incentives, vaccination education strategies/programmes and internal vs external funding for vaccines.\n\nVaccine prioritization (V1) records the ranked position for different groups within a country’s prioritization plan. This is the official plan of the official order in which categories are to be vaccinated. This is recorded regardless of whether a country has capacity to distribute and administer vaccines. Vaccination eligibility/availability (V2) is a categorical/binary variable that records which categories of people, regardless of their position in a prioritized rollout plan, are currently receiving vaccinations. This is recorded as a non-zero value if there is evidence that people in this category are being vaccinated, whether this is happening in a targeted geographical region or nationwide. There must be de facto evidence that this is happening to record a non-zero value in V2. For ‘elderly’ groups, we used local elderly age definitions using qualitative notes where available. In the absence of local guidance on elderly age range, a default of 65+ yr was used. Vaccine financial support (V3) is recorded on an ordinal scale. It reports how vaccines are funded for each category selected in V2 as currently receiving vaccination (1 for full cost to individual, 2 for partially funded by government, 3 for fully funded by government/free). Mandatory vaccination (V4) is a binary variable which reports the existence of a requirement for a category of people to be vaccinated. These are government policy requirements to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to work in a specific occupation, or for a specific group to be vaccinated. This is a mandatory vaccination required as part of occupation or citizenship, and we do not record policies that only ‘encourage’ voluntary vaccination to access non-essential services, facilities or freedoms. For example, if healthcare workers must be vaccinated to attend their place of work, this is recorded in V4. As detailed in our interpretation guidance, if there is a vaccine mandate in place for workers of certain occupations, and non-vaccinated people in this occupation have the option of testing regularly to opt out of vaccination, we still record this as a mandate in V4. If vaccination is mandatory in a subnational region as a result of an official national or local government policy, we record this in V4. We do not report enforcement of vaccine mandates, just the policy.\n\nThe vaccination policy dataset also contains summary indicators. These use an ordinal scale to report one number per indicator to offer a succinct summary on the basis of data entered for variables in the main V1–V4 dataset. These are summarized in our codebook (see Supplementary Information). V2, V3 and V4 policies are reported as non-zero values on the date when the policy came into effect, as opposed to the date they were announced. We report the V1 government rollout prioritization plan on the date the policy was published. For the analysis in this paper, the detailed qualitative notes section was used to manually find specific age floors for when different ages became eligible for vaccination, rather than using the age ranges in the quantitative data due to the limitations described above.\n\nIn March 2022, the OxCGRT NPI dataset and data structure was altered to reflect the different policies for unvaccinated and vaccinated people (for COVID-19), where passes or proof of either negative testing or vaccination were required to access different areas of public life (https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-scratchpad/tree/master/differentiated_vaccination_policies). For ten indicators (C1–8, H6 and H8), both the policy values for non-vaccinated and vaccinated people are reported if there are different policies in place. If there is no differentiation, one value is reported. These differentiated values relate only to ‘voluntary access’ to elements of public life, such as attending large events or entertainment and dining venues, which are controlled by testing, evidence of previous immunity or vaccination status through a form of certification or proof.\n\nIt is valuable to record both mandatory vaccine policies and voluntary vaccine pass/passport policies. This differentiated coding is reported in our NPI dataset with ‘V’ and ‘NV’ designations (for example, ‘C1V_School closing’ and C1NV_School closing’) and is distinct from the ‘V4 - mandatory vaccination’ indicator reported in this paper.\n\nData collection\n\nWe collected and published data on publicly available sources, which are freely available through internet searches. These are found on government websites, policy briefs and reputable news outlets. The best-quality sources are original policy documents and high-quality media outlets. These sources are codified into the OxCGRT data protocol and entered into the database. A detailed qualitative note (written in English) and web-archived source are provided for context.\n\nThe V1–V4 data for the national dataset were initially collected by OxCGRT researchers and a small group of experienced and specially trained volunteer data collectors who received specific training. As of 1 January 2022, data collection for V1–V4 was integrated into the core OxCGRT data collection process, which involves an international team of hundreds of volunteer data collectors covering 90+ unique languages. Where language was a barrier, and where English sources could not be found, local speakers from the pool of OxCGRT contributors were consulted, or translation tools such as Google Translate were utilized. The majority of data collectors are/were postgraduate students at universities around the world. Each data collector completed a bespoke online e-learning course, which took around 45 min to complete, covering the V1–V4 indicators, key coding interpretation points and data quality. Every week of data collection was reviewed by a member of the OxCGRT team for quality and accuracy, and was further reviewed by a trained V1–V4 specific volunteer reviewer (also trained via a bespoke reviewer training e-learning course) and confirmed in the database over the medium to longer term. On GitHub, we published both a codebook and an interpretation guide to standardize interpretation and ensure that all coders were making the same logical choices for data entry. We also published a ‘best fit’ table which records where categories have been substituted when there is a category announced in a policy that is not listed in V1/2, ensuring the standardization of ‘best fit’ interpretation (Supplementary Table 4). This highlights the importance of the ‘notes’ function for each indicator, enabling an in-depth qualitative analysis of the data beyond the numerical summaries. Qualitative notes in our comma-separated values files (CSVs) can be used to find archived original policy documents and specific groups prioritized in each country if a best fit has been used.\n\nData publication and summary indicators\n\nThe data are published in a standalone ‘Vaccines_full.csv’ on GitHub, which includes all the 52 categories for V1–V4. They are also summarized in 9 summary indicators, which report one single number for V1 (vaccination prioritization), V2 (vaccination eligibility/availability) categories (overall summary, general population age floor, at-risk age floor, medically clinically vulnerable (non-elderly), education, frontline workers (non-healthcare), frontline workers (healthcare)) and V3. These summary indicators are included in most of our data CSVs on GitHub, including the NPI dataset ‘OxCGRT_nat_latest.csv’. The data are published in real time and updated each week by the team of international data collectors.\n\nIndependent data quality check\n\nWe conducted a data quality and accuracy check, where two core team researchers checked the data and original source material for 100 randomly selected data entry points, focusing on the period of time when the majority of new policies and policy changes were being made, and during which the majority of data were entered for all four vaccination policy indicators. The researchers independently verified that 90% of the original data entries in the database were correct, by analysing original source material and checking this alongside the database entries. The remaining 10 entries were corrected. Specifics such as date of announcement vs date of policy effect, accuracy of selected groups and ages, and ensuring that any recorded mandates were in fact government mandates were among the various checks in this independent data quality review process.\n\nAs part of the weekly data update cycle, a small team of specially trained reviewers are tasked with checking and confirming data entered. As part of this review process, changes to the data are made retroactively, meaning values on past dates may change. As a result, we recommend downloading the most recent data and stating the download date when using them for analysis. The data used for this paper up to 15 June 2022 have been checked thoroughly by the authors. On the rare occasion where data could not be verified or confirmed by local sources, or via translation, they were not included. An unintentional consequence of this is that a group that was prioritized/eligible/mandated to receive a COVID-19 vaccine may not have been captured by our dataset.\n\nComparison to other data sources\n\nWe do not know of any other datasets publishing systematic data on COVID-19 vaccine policies. This unique source therefore adds considerable value to other datasets. For example, the Reuters COVID-19 vaccination tracker, although no longer updating data, reported the prioritization plan (similar to V1 - vaccine prioritization), availability and eligibility (similar to V2 - vaccination eligibility/availability) of different groups for vaccination in each country, although this does not provide the original archived source material, dates or a time series dataset to evidence when groups became eligible (https://www.reuters.com/graphics/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/). The Africa CDC Vaccine Dashboard also reports the date vaccination campaign commenced (similar to V2) in African nations, although it does not provide original archived source material, or state when which groups began to receive vaccines (https://africacdc.org/covid-19-vaccination/). Coronanet includes questions on the number of priority groups for vaccine distribution (similar to V1) but only through 2021 (https://www.coronanet-project.org/assets/CoronaNet_Codebook.pdf).\n\nVaccine policy data are particularly useful when combined with information on the number of vaccine doses administered. For example, the OxCGRT vaccine policy data are displayed as part of Our World in Data’s COVID-19 vaccinations website resource3, which combines country-specific vaccination data into a single resource. Our data can be compared to variables such as proportion of the population that has received one dose, vaccination uptake rates and number of doses administered, to consider the effects of vaccination policies on these. Our H7 indicator, which is a summary of our V2 vaccination policy indicator, is also displayed here. The data are also used by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and WHO’s Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity (https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/), demonstrating their value in informing an interactive accessible tool to reflect the data on the COVID-19 rollout to ensure equitable access.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://covid19.healthdata.org/global?view=vaccinations&tab=trend', 'Headline': 'COVID-19 Projections - Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation', 'Snippet': 'Explore forecasts of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospital resource use.

The daily average number of new cases in the United States on Tuesday was more than 267,000, exceeding the previous all-time peak set in January; Wednesday’s average was higher still, at more than 300,000.\n\nNew cases in at least 11 European countries — Britain, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain and Switzerland — also passed their previous all-time peaks on Tuesday or Wednesday.

These include states with comparatively high vaccination rates: Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island, all of which are at least 70 percent fully vaccinated. In addition to being more transmissible generally, Omicron also appears to give rise to more breakthrough infections.\n\nSimilarly, some of the European countries currently facing serious surges have among the world’s highest vaccination rates. In Portugal, where 88 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, cases are up more than 200 percent in the past two weeks. Spain, where new cases have more than quintupled in the past three weeks, is 80 percent fully vaccinated.\n\nSo far, overall hospitalization and death rates have not come close to reaching previous peak levels, though some places are struggling. About 78,000 people in the United States are hospitalized with the virus, compared with over 130,000 at the height of last winter’s peak. The average daily rate of deaths across much of the world also remains lower than the record rates seen earlier in the pandemic.\n\nA combination of immunity from vaccines, booster shots and previous infections is most likely at least partially responsible for lower hospitalization and mortality. Encouraging early data also suggests the Omicron variant may be less virulent than previous strains of the virus.\n\nThe recent surges in all these places, however, have been fast and steep, and severe outcomes usually lag case spikes by at least a few weeks, so hospitalizations and death rates may rise in the coming days.\n\n“This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse and again disrupting lives and livelihoods,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said at a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nCase rates in South America, Asia and much of Africa have so far remained relatively low. And at least some countries that saw record case loads this month may be turning a corner. In southern Africa, where scientists first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization, cases remain higher than on the rest of the continent but appear to be abating.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. health officials continued to stress the importance of vaccination and booster doses. In a White House news briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that people eligible for a booster shot who have not yet gotten one “do have some protection against severe disease and death,” though she added that “they do have quite a bit of waning with regard to protection against infection.”\n\nThat group with waning immunity comprises those who completed a Moderna or Pfizer two-dose series six months ago or more, or received a Johnson & Johnson shot at least two months ago.\n\nAlthough Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, discouraged large New Year’s Eve parties, his advice in the news conference Wednesday was more measured when it came to small gatherings of vaccinated people.\n\n“Although the risk is never zero in anything, the risk is low enough that we feel you should continue to go through with those plans of having a home-related, vaccinated, boosted gathering with family and close friends who are also vaccinated and boosted,” he said.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/28/americas/latin-america-vaccination-rates-intl/index.html', 'Headline': 'Many Latin American countries now have higher vaccination rates than ...', 'Snippet': 'Many countries in Latin America were hit with soaring Covid-19 death rates early in the pandemic, as coronavirus raged throughout the region.

The tide is turning in many Latin American nations today, where vaccination rates are outpacing countries in Europe and North America and helping drive down deaths.\n\nThe vaccine rollout was slow at the start, with just getting the vaccines in hand a major issue. Just six months ago, Latin America and the Caribbean were reporting just under half of all Covid-19 related deaths worldwide. Now, the region accounts for about 10% of Covid-19 related deaths, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThat’s due to the accelerated delivery of European, American, Chinese and homegrown vaccines that a number of Latin American nations have received in the second half of this year, according to Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) data.\n\nCuba, Chile and Brazil are among the top ten countries globally in terms of those fully vaccinated, according to statistics compiled by PAHO.\n\nOne reason for those successful vaccination campaigns can be chalked up to history: Many countries in Latin America have long-standing and trusted national inoculation drives against other diseases, such as polio.\n\nCuba has, perhaps, fared best in this regard, with its bet on its homegrown vaccines – approved for emergency use by its drug regulators this summer – paying off.\n\nThe country has the highest rate of vaccination in the region – and one of the highest in the world – with 84.1% of its inhabitants fully vaccinated, according to PAHO. In September, Cuba became the first in the world to begin the mass vaccination of kids as young as 2 against Covid.\n\nScientists say the Cuban-made vaccines are safe and effective in preventing serious illness and death. The government applied for World Health Organization approval for its vaccines in September.\n\nMeanwhile Brazil, home to one of the highest Covid-19 death rates in the world, has emerged from its darkest days of the pandemic with a successful vaccination drive. Major cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have seen more than 99% of the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, Reuters reports.\n\nBrazil has administered more than 315 million doses, with 65.7% of the population fully vaccinated, according to PAHO data up to December 23.\n\nChile’s record is even better – with 85.6% of the population fully vaccinated. Uruguay has vaccinated 76.6% of its inhabitants and Argentina’s vaccination rates sit at 70%.\n\nIn Ecuador, 69.1% of its eligible population is already fully vaccinated. There, Covid-19 vaccinations will be made mandatory for people who are eligible for the vaccine from ages five and older, the Ecuadorian health ministry said on Thursday, becoming the first country in Latin America to impose such measure for the entire eligible population. The vaccination will not be mandatory for those with pre-existing medical conditions, the health ministry statement said.\n\nAnd in Peru, which has suffered the highest rate of Covid-19 deaths anywhere in the world, 63.9% of the eligible population is now fully vaccinated.\n\nRegionally, over 868 million doses have been administered as of December 22 in Latin America and the Caribbean, PAHO reported, with around 57% of Latin America and the Caribbean’s population fully vaccinated. That compares to 67.8% in Europe and 61.3% in the United States.\n\nUneven rates\n\nStill, PAHO warns that vaccination remains uneven across the Latin America and Caribbean region, “with a handful of countries unlikely to reach the 40% vaccination target by the end of the year and many just above the 50% threshold of full COVID-19 immunization.”\n\nCountries that are continuing to struggle with their rollouts include Jamaica and French Guyana, where 18.7% and 25.4% of people are fully vaccinated. Among the larger countries in the region, Mexico has only just passed the 50% threshold.\n\nAnd as the Omicron variant spreads, like in much of the world, Latin America is beginning to see a spike in reported cases. In the week to December 23, the Americas (which includes the United States and Canada) reported over 1.1 million new Covid-19 infections – a 6% increase in cases from the previous week.\n\nHowever, much of that rise was driven by cases in the US, with PAHO reporting an overall case drop in South America of 10.7% in cases and a 6.3% decrease in deaths in that week.\n\nBolivia was the outlier, reporting a sharp increase in cases, as did some parts of the Caribbean, where a PAHO analysis showed cases increased by 16%.\n\nAs well as imported vaccines, Latin America is now producing more of its own. This month, PAHO Director General Carissa Etienne welcomed WHO approval of an AstraZeneca vaccine jointly produced by Argentina and Mexico – the first in Latin America.\n\n“This is an important milestone for Latin America and highlights the importance of technology transfer to increase the availability of quality COVID-19 vaccines in the region,” Etienne said.'}}",96.875,3
