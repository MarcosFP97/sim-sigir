We used latent class growth analysis to determine patterns (or classes) of pandemic-related food insecurity during a 1-year period.\n\nResults\n\nWe found 10 classes of trajectories of food insecurity, including 1 class of consistent food security (64.7%), 1 class of consistent food insecurity (3.4%), 5 classes of decreasing food insecurity (15.8%), 2 classes of increasing food insecurity (4.6%), and 1 class of stable but elevated food insecurity (11.6%). Relative to the class that remained food secure, other classes were younger, had a greater proportion of women, and tended to identify with a racial or ethnic minority group.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe found heterogeneous longitudinal patterns in the development, resolution, or persistence of food insecurity during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences of food insecurity were highly variable across the US population, with one-third experiencing some form of food insecurity risk. Findings have implications for identifying population groups who are at increased risk of food insecurity and related health disparities beyond the first year of the pandemic.\n\nTop\n\nIntroduction\n\nFood insecurity — which occurs when access to adequate food to live a healthy life is limited by a lack of money or other resources — is a major public health problem in the US that contributes substantially to the burden of chronic disease and poor mental health (1). Food insecurity results in an estimated $77 billion each year in excess health care spending (2). More than 1 in 10 US households experienced food insecurity in 2020 (3). The Healthy People 2020 goal was to reduce the national prevalence of food insecurity to 6%, and this is now the target for Healthy People 2030 (4).\n\nAlong with illness and death in the US (5) and globally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a cascade of economic and social disruptions that increased food insecurity, particularly in its earliest months (6). Data from the US Census Household Pulse Survey showed that food insufficiency (a severe form of food insecurity) rose from 8% in March 2020 to 10% in June 2020 (7). Some households, such as Black and Hispanic or Latino households and households with children, were found to be more vulnerable than other households to food insecurity as a result of the pandemic (3,7). In addition to these national prevalence studies, other studies have estimated food insecurity to be much higher in some samples (8,9); these studies differed in sample representation (online convenience vs community-based samples), study design (cross-sectional vs longitudinal), and food insecurity measures (single vs multiple items) (3,6–9).\n\nThe growing body of evidence shows that experiences of COVID-19 pandemic–related food insecurity varied substantially across the US population. However, most epidemiologic studies cross-sectionally assessed food insecurity during a reference period (eg, the previous 12 months) and did not follow respondents over time to examine variability of experiences during that time. This is an important research gap, because most households with food insecurity tend to experience episodic rather than chronic food insecurity (10). Few studies have characterized the variability of food insecurity over time (11). Measurement of the timing of food insecurity in a more granular fashion has led to important public health and clinical outcomes, including increased use of emergency departments and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia at the end of the month versus earlier weeks of the month based on claims data (12).\n\nThe objective of our study was to characterize the heterogeneity in food insecurity during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified trajectories through repeated measures data that assessed the probability food insecurity every 2 weeks in a nationally representative US sample. Characterizing the heterogeneity in food insecurity during this pivotal period is important to inform public health efforts to reduce food insecurity and its associated health harms, to monitor the impact of food insecurity–related policies, and to prioritize efforts designed for populations at greatest risk of persistent food insecurity.\n\nTop\n\nMethods\n\nData source and sampling\n\nWe used publicly available and deidentified data from the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative panel study of approximately 9,500 adult respondents conducted by the Center for Economic and Social Research at the University of Southern California. Launched in 2014, UAS is an internet panel study that uses an address-based probability sampling strategy and provides internet-connected tablets to respondents to minimize the effects of the digital divide for online survey completion. Each survey of the UAS is approved by the University of Southern California human subjects committee internal review board. In March 2020, UAS launched the Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, a longitudinal series of surveys that assessed economic and health-related indicators during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were administered every 2 weeks from March 10, 2020, through March 30, 2021, then monthly through July 20, 2021.\n\nFor this study, we analyzed data from waves 2 through 25, or April 1, 2020, through March 30, 2021, because these waves occurred during the first year of the pandemic and had consistent measures of food insecurity. A total of 8,425 unique participants responded to at least 1 survey during the study period. We excluded participants from analysis if they did not complete more than 1 survey (n = 429) or did not provide at least 2 waves of responses to the food insecurity measures (n = 52), yielding a total sample of 7,944 unique respondents. On average, these respondents completed 21.3 (SD, 4.7) waves for a total of 148,392 surveys. Of these surveys, 98.6% (n = 146,265) had responses to food insecurity measures. Participants provided informed consent before completing their first survey either electronically or on paper. More information on the survey methodology and sampling can be found at https://uasdata.usc.edu.\n\nMeasures\n\nFood insecurity. Three survey items were adapted from the US Department of Agriculture’s US Household Food Security Survey (13), designed to assess food insecurity in the previous 12 months. Understanding Coronavirus in America survey respondents were asked the following questions in reference to the past 7 days: 1) “Were you worried you would run out of food because of a lack of money or other resources?” 2) “Did you eat less than you thought you should because of a lack of money or other resources?” and 3) “Did you go without eating for a whole day because of a lack of money or other resources?” Answer choices were yes, no, or unsure. For the 3 questions, unsure accounted for 2.6%, 2.1%, and 1.4% of responses, respectively. Given prior research on social desirability bias when assessing food insecurity (14) and the small number of unsure responses, we considered yes and unsure to be affirmative responses. In total, 8.9% of surveys were affirmative for item 1, 7.9% for item 2, and 4.2% for item 3. We coded food insecurity status (binary outcome) as affirmative (yes or unsure) to any of the 3 items.\n\nSociodemographic characteristics. Sociodemographic characteristics were age, binary sex, marital status, race (White or Caucasian [hereinafter White], Black or African American, Native American/American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian/Asian American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, mixed), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino), educational attainment, annual household income, employment status, receipt of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, household composition (no children in household vs children in household), and US Census Bureau–designated geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West). Sociodemographic factors are based on responses to participants’ first survey, collected from April 1, 2020, through March 2, 2021.\n\nAnalysis\n\nWe used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) (15) to identify clusters of people (ie, latent classes) based on variability in their binary response of any food insecurity over time. LCGA is a longitudinal clustering technique that uses latent (unobserved) variables (16,17) and has similarities to other trajectory modeling techniques, including latent growth mixture modeling, but LCGA does not allow for within-class variation in trajectories (18). Classes identified by LCGA are not known a priori and are determined empirically, but because a substantial proportion of survey participants were observed to have no change in food insecurity status over time, we assigned them to either a class that remained food secure or a class that remained insecure throughout the study period (n = 5,317) (19).\n\nWe estimated a trajectory shape for each class, and participants (n = 2,627) were assigned to latent classes according to their posterior probabilities (20). The 1-class solution was first specified, which was then used as a comparison for solutions of increasing class size until the best solution was identified. To identify the optimal number of classes, we evaluated statistical indices and tests and parameter estimates, including likelihood ratio tests, such as the Vuong–Lo–Mendell–Rubin test and Lo–Mendell–Rubin adjusted test, entropy, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), sample-size adjusted BIC, corrected AIC for small sample sizes, and assessment of class cell sizes (16) (Supplemental Table 1 in Appendix). We created a graph in Excel (Microsoft Corporation) of the average probability of endorsing food insecurity at each time within each cluster.\n\nThe food insecurity outcome was binary and represented any affirmative indication of food insecurity. We therefore relied on a commonly used approach for a latent variable model for a binary outcome, which was to assume that a normally distributed latent variable (food insecurity*) exists, from which participants respond affirmatively when the latent variable exceeds some threshold (16). That is, in these models, for individual i across time points\n\nFood Insecurityi = Yes if τ < Food Insecurityi*\n\nwhere τ is the threshold parameter.\n\nThe interpretation of the model coefficients in our LCGA followed from probit analyses. That is, within each cluster, the model coefficient for the linear slope is the change in the z score of a normal distribution for a 1-unit change in time. We assumed linear growth in food insecurity after evaluating descriptive plots and generalized estimating equations models of the longitudinal data in the entire sample. We used the MLR option in Mplus to estimate the model (21), which uses maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters but uses a robust sandwich-type estimator (Huber–White sandwich estimator) to calculate SEs (22). Robust approaches are resistant to errors under small violations of parametric assumptions. Our model also effectively handled ignorable missing data dependent on the data in hand (ie, following a missing-at-random assumption) via full information maximum likelihood. As a result, participants with missing data could still be included in the trajectory analysis for unbiased inference. In total, 80.0% of surveys were completed by all participants with responses to food insecurity questions. We examined sociodemographic factors across each trajectory for descriptive purposes in post hoc analyses.\n\nWe defined α = .05 for our level of significance in all statistical tests, which were 2-tailed. We conducted LCGA in Mplus version 8.6 (21). We used R program in the R studio environment (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) for data management and graphic displays, and we used the MplusAutomation package to automate LCGA estimation and interpretation (23). Sample weights were not included in the LCGA but were used to calculate summary statistics and summarize sociodemographic characteristics, which were calculated by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).\n\nTop\n\nResults\n\nApproximately two-thirds (60.0%) of the sample at first survey were aged 18 to 50 years (Table 1). Just over half of the sample identified as female (53.9%), were married (53.4%), and were currently working (57.2%). The proportion of self-identified race and ethnicity in this sample generally mirrored the overall US population; for race, 75.9% identified as White only, 13.0% as Black only, and 5.6% as Asian only. For ethnicity, 19.1% identified as Hispanic/Latino. Approximately one-third had a bachelor’s degree or more (33.8%), earned more than $75,000 annually (34.4%), had children in the household (34.7%), and were living in the South (38.8%).\n\nFood insecurity trajectories\n\nIn the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020, the prevalence of any food insecurity was as high as 20.4%. The prevalence decreased to 8.9% by March 2021, with most of the decline occurring in the early months, before leveling off in mid-2020 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPrevalence of any food insecurity among respondents (N = 7,944) to the Understanding America Study, Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, April 2020 through March 2021. Shading indicates 95% CIs. [A tabular version of this figure is available.]\n\nWe identified 10 unique trajectories of food insecurity (Figure 2), including the 2 trajectories that were empirically assigned (remained food secure and remained food insecure). Each trajectory can be described by the shape of its curve: 3 trajectories showed little change (remained insecure, remained elevated, and remained secure), 2 trajectories indicated a high probability of initial food insecurity followed by a precipitous decline (named “initial shock 1” and “initial shock 2”), 3 trajectories with a high probability of initial food insecurity followed by a steady state of decline (named “recovering 1,” “recovering 2,” and “recovering 3”), and 2 trajectories with a relatively low probability of initial food insecurity followed by a steady state of incline (named “became insecure 1” and “became insecure 2”).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nProbability of experiencing food insecurity among respondents (N = 7,944) to the Understanding America Study, Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, April 2020 through March 2021. Three categories (remained secure, remained insecure, and remained elevated) were characterized as consistent. Two categories (initial shock 1 and initial shock 2) were characterized by a rapid decline in food insecurity status between March and July 2020. Three categories (recovering 1, recovering 2, and recovering 3) were defined as having experienced food insecurity initially, with the likelihood steadily declining during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two categories (became insecure 1 and became insecure 2) were defined as steadily becoming food insecure during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Abbreviation: FDA, Food and Drug Administration. [A tabular version of this figure is available.]\n\nAlthough most (64.7%) of the US-representative sample was in the “remained secure” category, 35.3% experienced some form of food insecurity (with 3.4% remaining insecure) during the first year of the pandemic (Table 2). Within that 35.3%, we found much variability. In addition to the 2 groups whose food security/insecurity status did not change, another group showed minimal changes: this group was mostly food secure during the study period but had an elevated prevalence of food insecurity, beginning at 13.6% in April 2020 and ending at 7.5% in March 2021. This group, “remained elevated,” comprised 11.6% of the study population.\n\nFive groups experienced some early form of food insecurity, but their probability of being food insecure declined over time. Two such trajectories, initial shock 1 (4.6% of the study population) and initial shock 2 (3.2% of the study population), appear to have briefly experienced food insecurity. This experience may have been largely related to the initial economic shutdowns in the earliest months of the pandemic in 2020, wherein states and municipalities issued stay-at-home or lockdown orders to mitigate the spread of the virus. These 2 trajectories are distinguished by the length of time needed for food insecurity to be resolved. Participants classified as initial shock 1 took about 16 weeks to resolve, while initial shock 2 was resolved within 8 weeks.\n\nThree groups took longer to recover from food insecurity experienced earlier in the pandemic: “recovering 1” (4.3%) ended the first year at a slightly elevated probability of food insecurity, while “recovering 2” (2.6%) and “recovering 3” (1.1%) had a similar rate or slope of recovery but a different initial probability of food insecurity.\n\nThe probability of becoming food insecure increased during the first year of the pandemic for 2 groups. These 2 trajectories, “became insecure 1” (3.1%) and “became insecure 2” (1.5%), had nearly the same rate or slope of becoming food insecure but their initial probability of food insecurity differed.\n\nAlthough small sample sizes and corresponding wide 95% CIs in some groups precluded a statistical comparison of sociodemographic characteristics across trajectories, characteristics appeared to differ in several ways (Supplemental Table 2A and 2B in Appendix). Those who remained food secure, compared with those in other trajectories, tended to be older, self-identified as White, and had a greater income at first interview.\n\nTop\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study is among the first to describe population-level longitudinal patterns in the development, resolution, or persistence of food insecurity during a key time of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing heterogeneity in food insecurity experiences during this period. Notably, one-third of the population was found to experience any food insecurity when assessed longitudinally, whether food insecurity existed from the start and persisted (for approximately 15%), improved (for approximately 16%), or worsened (for approximately 5%). With careful attention to not overextend the findings of this initial study, we also observed that certain patterns of food insecurity corresponded with pivotal periods during the first year of the pandemic, starting with abrupt and widespread economic shutdowns in the earliest months. We found 2 patterns of food insecurity that occurred mainly in the earliest months of the pandemic before resolving relatively shortly thereafter (ie, initial shock 1 and initial shock 2). Therefore, an important consideration raised by our findings relates to the definition and measurement of food insecurity when accounting for the many factors that drive food insecurity.\n\nWhile food insecurity at the individual level occurs when access to adequate food is limited or uncertain because of a lack of money or other resources (13), the pillars of food security in a global context also include availability, use, and stability (24). The pandemic introduced a host of other factors described elsewhere (ie, business and school closures, supply chain issues, and stockpiling of groceries and resulting shortages) (6,25) that affected experiences of food insecurity for reasons beyond a person’s lack of access caused by money. Our findings, particularly data on the initial shock 1 and initial shock 2 groups, may speak to food insecurity experiences that were driven more by societal disruptions than by economic or financial uncertainty at the individual level. For instance, while worrying about running out of food before being able to buy more is a key screening question for food insecurity (14), affirmative responses to this question could have also been driven by factors that go beyond having enough money for food. That respondents in the initial shock 2 group appeared to share similar sociodemographic characteristics with respondents in the group that remained food secure raises new considerations in defining and measuring food insecurity in the context of a novel global pandemic.\n\nSeveral patterns of food insecurity described here, such as the one for people who remained food insecure during the entire study period, are particularly concerning. Because nearly half of those in the remained insecure group were SNAP recipients at the outset of the study period, this group may represent a small but important population for whom existing food insecurity protection policies were already not sufficient or whose food insecurity was not being adequately addressed before the pandemic. Groups that showed increases in the probability of food insecurity over time also warrant attention; 2 groups, “became insecure 1” and “became insecure 2,” were worse off 1 year after the onset of the pandemic than at the beginning. Although small sample sizes preclude us from making reliable sociodemographic comparisons, findings suggest that the initial probability of food insecurity distinguished the trajectories of these 2 groups.\n\nSeveral lessons can be learned from populations that experienced food insecurity early in the pandemic but either recovered entirely or were headed toward recovery 1 year later. In studies of food insecurity after other large-scale and highly disruptive events, such as Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana (26) and Hurricane Harvey in Texas (27), findings highlighted several sociodemographic characteristics as protective factors (ie, income, partner status) and risk factors (ie, low levels of social support, poor physical or mental health, female sex/gender) for remaining food insecure in the year(s) after the events. Notably absent in the literature is substantive longitudinal research on the impact of recovery policies. Given the wide berth of policies implemented in the US in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial opportunity exists to explore how these policies, such as those directly aimed at reducing food insecurity or unemployment, may have contributed to each trajectory to identify what aspects of each policy either contributed to recovery or inhibited it.\n\nA wealth of research demonstrates the relationship among income, employment status, and food insecurity. However, the confluence of various local, state, and federal responses to the pandemic provides a unique microcosm for examining a more direct impact on food insecurity. One multisite analysis found that food insecurity was highest during the pandemic among those who experienced job disruptions (28). The initial expiration of unemployment insurance at the federal level at the end of July 2020, along with the general uncertainty about its extension or even the future COVID-19 landscape, likely played a role in the upward trend in overall food insecurity observed around August 2020 (29,30). Further work in this area may entail examining how the economic impact of business closures and unemployment insurance claims (31) may have affected trajectories of food insecurity. For instance, researchers could examine the association of food insecurity trajectories with the comparative efficiency with which states implemented unemployment policies. Furthermore, research using other data sources would be necessary to examine the influence of policies such as the expanded child tax credit.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur study has several limitations. Measures of food insecurity were examined only during the first year of the pandemic and did not account for food insecurity experienced before the pandemic nor their trajectory as the pandemic extended beyond March 2021. This study also assumed that all LCGA model assumptions were met in this sample for valid inference (ie, within-class multivariate normality) (32). We did perform more robust inference in case model parametric assumptions that were violated. Another limitation is that in our chosen 10-class solution, some classes had small cell sizes, and the entropy values and some of the averages of posterior probability of membership were low (2 clusters had an average posterior probability of membership below the threshold of 0.70 considered as a general guideline for adequate assignment accuracy) (33). Thus, we chose as our selection criteria global model fit and thorough interpretability of the possible clustering in this data (ie, more clusters, each unique in characteristic) over a more precise solution involving fewer classes. The small sample sizes in some classes preclude formal comparisons of sociodemographic differences across classes, although we note that those who remained food secure tended to belong to historically advantaged sociodemographic groups, whereas racial and ethnic minority populations were more likely to experience other trajectories of food insecurity (34). Across the 10 classes that were identified here, the group least vulnerable to food insecurity — remained secure — had the highest proportion of respondents who self-identified as White, earned an annual income exceeding $75,000 per year, and had completed a bachelor’s degree or more.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur findings highlighted population-level heterogeneity in the experience of food insecurity in the US throughout the first year of the pandemic, particularly in demonstrating the large variability of population response to the pandemic in food insecurity experiences. These initial findings have implications for identifying population groups who are at increased risk of food insecurity and food-insecurity–related health disparities beyond the first year of the pandemic, with particular attention to those whose risk remained high, remained elevated, or increased over time. The findings here also provide an opportunity and suggest a need for public health researchers to take a more granular look at how policies may have affected food insecurity during the first year of the pandemic.\n\nTop\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe project described in this article relies on data from survey(s) administered by the UAS, which is maintained by the Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) at the University of Southern California (USC).

On the other side of the table, the obesity crisis also weighs heavily. Malnutrition is less about food than about socioeconomic factors such as conflict, poverty, and global disasters such as climate change and the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nutrition and infectious disease exist in an intricate dance. Adequate and balanced nutrition is critical for appropriate response to infection and any changes in the balance can serve as a tipping point for the next pandemic. On the other hand, pandemics, such as COVID-19, lead to greater malnutrition. Both over- and undernutrition increase severity of disease, alter vaccine effectiveness, and potentially create conditions for viral mutation and adaptation—further driving the disease and famine vicious cycle. These long-term health and socioeconomic repercussions have direct effects at individual and global levels and lead to long-term consequences. Therefore, investing in and strengthening public health, pandemic prevention, and nutrition programs become vital at a much more complex systems level.\n\nCitation: Hyder S, Chhem RK, Claes F, Karlsson EA (2022) Pestilence and famine: Continuing down the vicious cycle with COVID-19.

Around 536 AD, a volcano erupted—possibly in Iceland—spilling millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere across the Northern Hemisphere [1]. The sun disappeared for 18 months. Crops failed. Millions starved. It also likely sparked the Plague of Justinian (the first documented bubonic or “Black” plague), leading to more famine and devastation. It happened again in the 1300s. A volcanic eruption somewhere in New Zealand led to years of cool, rainy weather preventing crops from ripening in Europe [2]. Waves of respiratory diseases further weakened the population, leading to greater famine. This Great Famine possibly primed an undernourished, weakened population for the Black Death to ravage through Europe in 1346, killing more than a third of the population [3]. In 1815, Mount Tambora erupted in Indonesia, causing “the year without summer” and, as a long-term consequence, the Irish Potato Famine of 1845, which led to mass starvation and many death from communicable diseases [4].\n\nAre we detecting commonality here? The historical and biological Butterfly Effect of disease during a famine (or famine during outbreak) is an intricate dance. Infectious disease and malnutrition amplify bidirectionally. Catastrophes such as natural disasters, climate change, war, and economic collapse lead to starvation and infection. Weakened immune systems reduce resistance to further infection, and, ultimately, more malnutrition in a vicious cycle with long-lasting impacts on public health [5].\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic may not directly involve a volcano, history repeats itself. Disease leads to increased poverty, hunger, and changes in socioeconomic behaviors. Thus, insights from past pandemics frame the current COVID-19 hunger crisis and can inform actions to mitigate negative consequences from COVID-19 and future disease outbreaks. One of the most lasting legacies of the pandemic will be increased malnutrition—both undernutrition and obesity (Fig 1). These scars will echo with resounding implications, not only for pandemic recovery, but also for the future of emerging and endemic infectious diseases. Several factors should be considered to reflect on the future of nutrition and infectious disease through the lens of COVID-19:\n\nHunger: What doesn’t kill you, just makes you more vulnerable to something else killing you\n\nEvery year, over 5.5 million children die before the age of 5, mostly in Africa and Asia [6]. Half of these children are undernourished. Why? Apart from the necessity of food for sustaining life, nutritional deficiencies decrease immune response, resulting in increased susceptibility, severity, and mortality from diseases. Indeed, about 32% of the global infectious disease burden could be alleviated by eliminating malnutrition [7]. Undernourished children are more susceptible to respiratory infections, diarrhea, measles, and malaria, to name a few [7]. Unfortunately, infection also leads to poor nutrition by causing anorexia and malabsorption and increasing nutrition requirements for immune cells. This leads to even more undernutrition, increasing susceptibility to disease, and moving further down the vicious cycle [8,9].\n\nThe weight of obesity in infectious disease\n\nMalnutrition isn’t just about not having enough food, it’s also about eating too much. Obesity impairs immune function, leading to increased susceptibility to infection with a number of different pathogens including influenza and COVID-19 [10]. Why? Because your fat also talks to your immune system. Obesity alters adipose tissue signaling, resulting in miscommunication with the immune response and compromising function to deal with infections [11]. Therefore, this interrelationship between adipose tissue, immune response, and infections can exacerbate infection.\n\nYou are what your mother and mother’s mother ate\n\nThere is a direct linkage between maternal malnutrition and the nutritional status of her child. Early malnutrition significantly increases the risk of developing chronic diseases in adults, resulting in a weakened immune response to infectious diseases, and, beyond the age of 2 to 3 years, the effects of chronic malnutrition become almost irreversible [12,13]. Children of women who lived through the Hungry Winter of 1944 to 1945 in the Netherlands and the Chinese Great Famine of 1959 to 1961 faced higher rates of obesity, increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and increased rates of diabetes [12–14]. Even the grandchildren of these women were smaller than average and had a higher chance of becoming obese during adulthood [14]. But we shouldn’t point fingers at moms just yet. The nutritional environment both before conception and throughout gestation influences adult metabolism, but they are just one factor that involved in development.\n\nVaccination efficacy is like a bowl of porridge\n\nWhile opinions on vaccination are undoubtedly mixed, we cannot deny vaccines have greatly improved public health. Smallpox was eradicated in 1979. Polio, measles, and diphtheria are becoming rare. However, vaccine efficacy requires a functional immune system and nutrition is key to bolstering the immune response. Indeed, nutrition is a tipping point on the scales of immunity. Like Goldilocks, effective immunity requires everything to be just right. Too hot or too cold? Things start to break down. Undernutrition has been found to play a role in altering vaccine response for tuberculosis [15], rotavirus [16], measles, and pneumococcus [8]. Obesity also interferes with the ability to mount an effective immune response to vaccination. Obesity also reduces antibody response to hepatitis B and tetanus vaccination. While some associate this reduced response with improper needle length or vaccination technique, it’s also about the antibodies [17]. Compared with healthy-weight adults, vaccinated obese adults are at twice the risk of influenza-like illness or influenza despite equivalent serological response to the influenza vaccination [18].\n\nSometimes, viruses are what you eat\n\nNutritional excess or deficiency both dampen the host immune response and alter cellular metabolism, which creates an advantageous environment for viruses to explore the sequence space and potentially emerge with advantageous mutations [19]. Take obesity. The altered microenvironment associated with obesity supports a more diverse viral quasispecies—a mutant cloud of genomes that collectively infect, replicate, and spread among hosts—potentially evolving pathogenic variants capable of inducing greater transmission or disease severity [20]. On the flip side, nutritional deficiencies also change the genetic composition of viruses. In selenium-deficient and vitamin E-deficient mice, genetic mutations arise in coxsackie B and influenza virus populations, and benign strains become more virulent, even to well-nourished hosts [20].\n\nNutrition is critical for immune response and protection from infection. A significant proportion of people in the world are malnourished, a major concern for infectious disease. COVID-19 has increased malnutrition worldwide, creating conditions that may lead to the next pandemic. “People pack” by Dumitriu Robert, “Coronavirus pack” by Graphic Mall, “Coronavirus icon pack” by SkyClick, and “Coronavirus COVID-19 pack” by Eucalyp Studio are all available at http://www.iconfinder.com under a Creative Commons (Attribution 3.0 Unported) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). “Phosphor Thin Vol.4 pack” by Phosphor Icons is available at https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/phosphor-thin-vol-4 under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1010810.g001\n\nSo, what does this all mean? Nutrition and infection in the “New Normal”\n\nBefore the pandemic, the world was already malnourished. Only 2 out of every 5 people on the planet were considered healthy, and many of those probably had a vitamin deficiency [6]. Despite decades of effort, 820 million people in the world still faced hunger shortages and chronic malnutrition at the end of 2019 [21]. Economic slowdowns and downturns already undermined food security [22]. Then along came a pandemic. Lockdowns, supply chain issues, mass job losses, and political crises exacerbated major socioeconomic challenges and furthered food scarcity and inaccessibility. In all, it is estimated that COVID-19 has threatened access to a healthy diet for nearly 2 billion people [21], 6.7 million of those being children under the age of 5 [23].\n\nAlong with hunger, global obesity had nearly tripled since 1975, with almost 40% of adults being overweight in 2016 [24]. During the pandemic, as some were edging closer to wasting and stunting, others were ballooning further into obesity. Pandemic stress, job loss, decreased access to nutritious foods, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles have exacerbated the obesity epidemic [25]. For children in the United States, rate of body mass index increase nearly doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic [26]. As COVID-19 continues to aggravate malnutrition globally, it feeds the vicious cycle of malnutrition and infection with potentially even greater morbidity and mortality down the road. Furthermore, prophylactics for nutritionally compromised populations continue to remain uncharted territory, as a majority of vaccine seroconversion and effectiveness studies are performed on healthy individuals, a minority of the current global population [11].\n\nSo, even before the pandemic ends, we already need to start considering the next. The majority of critically malnourished people reside in global hotspots of emerging and endemic infectious diseases. Pathogens will continue spilling over. The vicious cycle will continue. Investing in and strengthening public health, pandemic prevention, equal access to healthy food, and good nutritional programs is vital. Even combating climate change is critical for agriculture, disease exposure, and, yes, volcanoes. About 1,500 potentially active volcanoes exist around the world. As our planet warms, these volcanoes are projected to become more active and the cooling effects of their eruptions are expected to increase by 15%, massively increasing repercussions. No one wants another worst year to be alive.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank everyone involved in critical discussions and review of this manuscript in the Virology Unit at Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, including Dr. Veasna Duong, and Dr. Jurre Siegers.\n\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

That\'s the sobering conclusion of a new report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which found hunger in the U.S. rose sharply in 2022.\n\nThe report found that 44.2 million people lived in households that had difficulty getting enough food to feed everyone in 2022, up from 33.8 million people the year prior. Those families include more than 13 million children experiencing food insecurity, a jump of nearly 45 percent from 2021.\n\n""These numbers are more than statistics. They paint a picture of just how many Americans faced the heartbreaking challenge last year of struggling to meet a basic need for themselves and their children,"" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said in a statement.\n\nThe findings reverse a decade-long decline in hunger and food insecurity in the U.S. And they reflect the loss of several pandemic-era measures designed to strengthen the social safety net, says Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies food insecurity and federal nutrition programs.\n\n""A lot of the programs that had buffered people\'s experience during the pandemic were retired or rolled back in some way,"" Waxman says.\n\nThose programs included an expanded child tax credit that gave families with children extra money, temporarily increased benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP – formerly known as food stamps – and free school meals for every child.\n\nAt the same time, food prices and housing costs have shot up, says Kelly Horton, chief program officer at the Food Research and Action Center. And she points out an increasing number of Americans are working in unstable gig-economy jobs, like delivering groceries, driving for ride-share services or completing tasks on demand.\n\n"" So all of these things converging...we have a lot of people who are living on the edge,"" Horton says.\n\nIn its report, the USDA found that nearly 7 million households were so financially squeezed last year that they had to skip meals at times because there wasn\'t enough food to go around. Almost all of these households said they couldn\'t afford to eat balanced meals. In some 381,000 households with children, kids also experienced the pangs of hunger – skipping meals or going the whole day without eating. Waxman notes this could have significant health consequences, especially for kids.\n\n""In particular, we worry about that for children because their trajectory now influences what happens to them later,"" says Waxman. She notes research has found children who experience food insecurity are more likely to experience worse health outcomes down the road, including cognitive or developmental delays and higher rates of hospitalization.\n\nOverall, households with children and those of color experienced food insecurity at significantly higher rates than the national average. The rates of hunger for Black and Latino households were both more than double the rates for white households.\n\nFood access advocates say the findings underscore the importance of protecting social safety-net programs. Right now, there\'s particular concern when it comes to the fate of the food assistance program known as WIC, which serves pregnant mothers and young children up to age 5.\n\nSince the pandemic-era increases to SNAP benefits ended, more families have been turning to WIC for help with food, says Nell Menefee-Libey, public policy manager at the National WIC Association.\n\n""We know that more families are turning to the program and find themselves needing support from WIC who may previously have not been using WIC services,"" Menefee-Libey says.\n\nBut some lawmakers have proposed funding cuts to WIC benefits, even as the program needs additional funding to serve the increased number of families that are seeking assistance, says Horton of FRAC.\n\n""So there could be a case where WIC runs out of money if Congress does not give them additional funds,"" Horton says.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/food-insecurity-in-the-time-of-covid', 'Headline': 'Food Insecurity in the Time of COVID - Johns Hopkins', 'Snippet': 'Even before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted food supplies, health systems, and global nutrition programs, 800 million around the world were undernourished (supplied with less than the minimum amount of the nutrients or foods essential for sound health and growth).

Children were especially vulnerable: 144 million children under five were stunted (low height-for-age). 47 million children were affected by wasting, a life-threatening form of malnutrition.\n\nAs nutrition policy expert Rebecca Heidkamp and co-authors wrote in a Nature study, “the world was already not on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2—to eliminate hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.”\n\nThe goal of their study was to model the potential short- and long-term impacts the pandemic would have on nutrition and recommend policies to mitigate damage.\n\nWith modeling tools, they were able to determine potential impacts under optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenarios from 2020 to 2022. One big challenge was that the pandemic itself interfered with capturing critical data—in this case, an exact count of wasted and stunted children.\n\n“We’ve been struggling to know what the actual impacts have been,” says Heidkamp, PhD, an associate scientist in International Health who specializes in developing nutrition policy in low- and middle-income countries. At the start of the pandemic, UN agencies, including WHO and UNICEF, were dependent on phone surveys to collect data. This meant researchers “couldn’t go out and actually measure women and children,” she says, and “that’s what we care about in nutrition.”\n\nThe study points to evidence from phone surveys in Asia and Africa revealing disruptions in food supply chains and a spike in food prices resulted in dramatic increases in poverty and food insecurity in 2020, forcing families to shift to poorer diets.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, countries like India and Brazil have adapted and scaled up government assistance programs and social safety net programs, such as social protection and cash and food transfers, but public health experts predict these efforts will be insufficient to return to living standards seen prior to the pandemic.\n\nStanding Together for Nutrition: A Trusted, Unified Voice\n\nEarly in the pandemic, lockdowns especially posed a threat to global nutrition efforts, including the disbursement of iron supplements through prenatal care for pregnant people at high risk of anemia; food assistance for families, such as staples like flour, cereal, beans, and lentils; and routine interventions to prevent and treat acute malnutrition. In addition, school closures halted school feeding programs.\n\nThe crisis led to the creation of a research and advocacy consortium involving several Bloomberg School faculty including Heidkamp, called Standing Together for Nutrition, or ST4N.\n\nThe group includes nutrition, economics, and food and health systems experts. Their goal: to identify the potential impacts of COVID—and now the war in Ukraine—on food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries, and ultimately recommend nutrition interventions to mitigate excess stunting and child mortality.\n\n“Now rising costs of products used to treat malnutrition are threatening to interrupt those programs as they cannot reach as many, even as the need goes up,” says Heidkamp.\n\nThe study reports that in 2019, the UN World Food Programme estimated that 150 million people in 81 different countries needed food assistance. In February of 2022, it rose to 276 million people. The agency predicts that number to increase to 323 million this year alone.\n\nHeidkamp anticipates that 2022 will be a big advocacy year for nutrition. “There are many challenges as we look ahead. … but we need to keep shining the light on these issues and figure out who the right global players will be,” she says.\n\nIn the Nature piece, Heidkamp and co-authors urge “governments, donors, and the UN to help prevent a major exacerbation of malnutrition.” They recommend succinct steps these players must take to build more sustainable food systems that can help support affordable and nutritious diets for all:\n\nEnd trade restrictions that affect access to nutrition.\n\nSustain or implement social protection programs.\n\nProtect national nutrition budgets.\n\nHonor commitments already made.\n\nMobilize more resources for humanitarian assistance.\n\nHeidkamp says it’s donors and affluent groups like the World Bank that have the power to strongly influence other countries toward ending trade restrictions, implementing social protection programs, and activating humanitarian assistance in order to end food insecurity and malnutrition.\n\nGrace Fernandez is a communications and marketing specialist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nRELATED:'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-search-engines-boost-misinformation/', 'Headline': 'How Search Engines Boost Misinformation | Scientific American', 'Snippet': 'For example, one of the misleading articles used in the study was entitled “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter.”', 'Full_text': ""“Do your own research” is a popular tagline among fringe groups and ideological extremists. Noted conspiracy theorist Milton William Cooper first ushered this rallying cry into the mainstream in the 1990s through his radio show, where he discussed schemes involving things such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, an Illuminati cabal and alien life. Cooper died in 2001, but his legacy lives on. Radio host Alex Jones’s fans, anti-vaccine activists and disciples of QAnon’s convoluted alternate reality often implore skeptics to do their own research.\n\nYet more mainstream groups have also offered this advice. Digital literacy advocates and those seeking to combat online misinformation sometimes spread the idea that when you are faced with a piece of news that seems odd or out of sync with reality, the best course of action is to investigate it yourself. For instance, in 2021 the Office of the U.S. Surgeon General put out a guide recommending that those wondering about a health claim’s legitimacy should “type the claim into a search engine to see if it has been verified by a credible source.” Library and research guides, often suggestthat people “Google it!” or use other search engines to vet information.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nUnfortunately, this time science seems to be on the conspiracy theorists’ side. Encouraging Internet users to rely on search engines to verify questionable online articles can make them more prone to believing false or misleading information, according to a study published today in Nature. The new research quantitatively demonstrates how search results, especially those prompted by queries that contain keywords from misleading articles, can easily lead people down digital rabbit holes and backfire. Guidance to Google a topic is insufficient if people aren’t considering what they search for and the factors that determine the results, the study suggests.\n\nIn five different experiments conducted between late 2019 and 2022, the researchers asked a total of thousands of online participants to categorize timely news articles as true, false or unclear. A subset of the participants received prompting to use a search engine before categorizing the articles, whereas a control group didn’t. At the same time, six professional fact-checkers evaluated the articles to provide definitive designations. Across the different tests, the nonprofessional respondents were about 20 percent more likely to rate false or misleading information as true after they were encouraged to search online. This pattern held even for very salient, heavily reported news topics such as the COVID pandemic and even after months had elapsed between an article’s initial publication and the time of the participants’ search (when presumably more fact-checks would be available online).\n\nFor one experiment, the study authors also tracked participants’ search terms and the links provided on the first page of the results of a Google query. They found that more than a third of respondents were exposed to misinformation when they searched for more detail on misleading or false articles. And often respondents’ search terms contributed to those troubling results: Participants used the headline or URL of a misleading article in about one in 10 verification attempts. In those cases, misinformation beyond the original article showed up in results more than half the time.\n\nFor example, one of the misleading articles used in the study was entitled “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter.” When participants included “engineered famine”—a unique term specifically used by low-quality news sources—in their fact-check searches, 63 percent of these queries prompted unreliable results. In comparison, none of the search queries that excluded the word “engineered” returned misinformation.\n\n“I was surprised by how many people were using this kind of naive search strategy,” says the study’s lead author Kevin Aslett, an assistant professor of computational social science at the University of Central Florida. “It’s really concerning to me.”\n\nSearch engines are often people’s first and most frequent pit stops on the Internet, says study co-author Zeve Sanderson, executive director of New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics. And it’s anecdotally well-established they play a role in manipulating public opinion and disseminating shoddy information, as exemplified by social scientist Safiya Noble’s research into how search algorithms have historically reinforced racist ideas. But while a bevy of scientific research has assessed the spread of misinformation across social media platforms, fewer quantitative assessments have focused on search engines.\n\nThe new study is novel for measuring just how much a search can shift users’ beliefs, says Melissa Zimdars, an assistant professor of communication and media at Merrimack College. “I’m really glad to see someone quantitatively show what my recent qualitative research has suggested,” says Zimdars, who co-edited the book Fake News: Understanding Media and Misinformation in the Digital Age. She adds that she’s conducted research interviews with many people who have noted that they frequently use search engines to vet information they see online and that doing so has made fringe ideas seem “more legitimate.”\n\n“This study provides a lot of empirical evidence for what many of us have been theorizing,” says Francesca Tripodi, a sociologist and media scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. People often assume top results have been vetted, she says. And while tech companies such as Google have instituted efforts to rein in misinformation, things often still fall through the cracks. Problems especially arise in “data voids” when information is sparse for particular topics. Often those seeking to spread a particular message will purposefully take advantage of these data voids, coining terms likely to circumvent mainstream media sources and then repeating them across platforms until they become conspiracy buzzwords that lead to more misinformation, Tripodi says.\n\nGoogle actively tries to combat this problem, a company spokesperson tells Scientific American. “At Google, we design our ranking systems to emphasize quality and not to expose people to harmful or misleading information that they are not looking for,” the Google representative says. “We also provide people tools that help them evaluate the credibility of sources.” For example, the company adds warnings on some search results when a breaking news topic is rapidly evolving and might not yet yield reliable results. The spokesperson further notes that several assessments have determined Google outcompetes other search engines when it comes to filtering out misinformation. Yet data voids pose an ongoing challenge to all search providers, they add.\n\nThat said, the new research has its own limitations. For one, the experimental setup means the study doesn’t capture people’s natural behavior when it comes to evaluating news says Danaë Metaxa, an assistant professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. The study, they point out, didn’t give all participants the option of deciding whether to search, and people might have behaved differently if they were given a choice. Further, even the professional fact-checkers that contributed to the study were confused by some of the articles, says Joel Breakstone, director of Stanford University’s History Education Group, where he researches and develops digital literacy curriculums focused on combatting online misinformation. The fact-checkers didn’t always agree on how to categorize articles. And among stories for which more fact-checkers disagreed, searches also showed a stronger tendency to boost participants’ belief in misinformation. It’s possible that some of the study findings are simply the result of confusing information—not search results.\n\nYet the work still highlights a need for better digital literacy interventions, Breakstone says. Instead of just telling people to search, guidance on navigating online information should be much clearer about how to search and what to search for. Breakstone’s research has found that techniques such as lateral reading, where a person is encouraged to seek out information about a source, can reduce belief in misinformation. Avoiding the trap of terminology and diversifying search terms is an important strategy, too, Tripodi adds.\n\n“Ultimately, we need a multipronged solution to misinformation—one that is much more contextual and spans politics, culture, people and technology,” Zimdars says. People are often drawn to misinformation because of their own lived experiences that foster suspicion in systems, such as negative interactions with health care providers, she adds. Beyond strategies for individual data literacy, tech companies and their online platforms, as well as government leaders, need to take steps to address the root causes of public mistrust and to lessen the flow of faux news. There is no single fix or perfect Google strategy poised to shut down misinformation. Instead the search continues.""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2023/01/05/recognizing-and-tackling-a-global-food-crisis', 'Headline': 'Recognizing and tackling a global food crisis - World Bank Group', 'Snippet': 'This year, acute food insecurity is projected to reach a new peak, surpassing the food crisis experienced in 2007-2008. A combination of factors—including greater poverty and supply chain disruptions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, rising inflation, and high commodity prices—has increased food and nutrition insecurity.', 'Full_text': 'This year, acute food insecurity is projected to reach a new peak, surpassing the food crisis experienced in 2007-2008. A combination of factors—including greater poverty and supply chain disruptions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, rising inflation, and high commodity prices—has increased food and nutrition insecurity. This is a multifaceted crisis, affecting access to and availability of food, with long-term consequences for health and productivity. The World Bank has scaled up its efforts to bolster food security, reduce risks, and strengthen food systems over the short and long term. Urgent action is needed across governments and multilateral partners to avert a severe and prolonged food crisis.\n\nDeclining food access and availability, with high risks\n\nFor most countries, domestic food prices have risen sharply in 2022, compromising access to food—particularly for low-income households, who spend the majority of their incomes on food and are especially vulnerable to food price increases. Higher food inflation followed a sharp spike in global food commodity prices, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. Average global wheat, maize, and rice prices were respectively 18 percent, 27 percent, and 10 percent higher in October 2022 relative to October 2021.\n\nAt the same time, food availability is declining. For the first time in a decade, global cereal production will fall in 2022 relative to 2021. More countries are relying on existing food stocks and reserves to fill the gap, raising the risk if the current crisis persists. And rising energy and fertilizer prices—key inputs to produce food—threaten production for the next season, especially in net fertilizer-importing countries and regions like East Africa.\n\nThese trends are already affecting health. Stunting and wasting in children, and anaemia in pregnant women, are increasing as households are less able to include sufficient nutrition in their diets. A recent World Bank survey indicated that 42 percent of households across all countries covered were unable to eat healthy or nutritious food in the previous 30 days. These health effects carry long-term consequences for the ability to learn and work, and therefore escape poverty.\n\nGlobally, food security is under threat beyond just the immediate crisis. Growing public debt burdens, currency depreciation, higher inflation, increasing interest rates, and the rising risk of a global recession may compound access to and availability of food, especially for importing countries. At the same time, the agricultural food sector is both vulnerable and a contributor to climate change, responsible for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. And agricultural productivity growth is not staying ahead of the impacts of climate change, contributing to more food-related shocks. For example, an unprecedented multi-season drought has worsened food insecurity in the Horn of Africa, with Somalia on the verge of famine.\n\nManaging the crisis and preparing for the future\n\nThe World Bank is responding to this escalating crisis with four areas of actions: (i) supporting production and producers, (ii) facilitating increased trade in food and production inputs, (iii) supporting vulnerable households, and (iv) investing in sustainable food security. It has made over $26 billion available for short- and long-term food security interventions in 69 countries, including active interventions in 22 of the 24 hunger hotspots identified as countries with the most pressing needs by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme. Since April 2022, the World Bank has disbursed $8.1 billion, approximately evenly split between crisis response and long-term resilience projects. In the short term, projects like the Emergency Project to Combat the Food Crisis in Cameroon will provide 98,490 beneficiaries with emergency food and nutrition assistance with support from the World Food Programme. In addition to supporting vulnerable households, governments of food-exporting countries can improve global food security by limiting measures like export bans and stockpiling of food. In the longer term, governments can make an enormous difference by repurposing public spending on agricultural policies and support for a more resilient and sustainable food system that directly improves health, economies, and the planet.\n\nThese actions and newly released funding underline the scale of the crisis. Timely, coordinated, and sustained action through partnerships such as the Global Alliance on Food Security can maximize the impact of new policies and funding, and mitigate the scale of the crisis.

A quality adjusted life year is one year of life in perfect health.\n\nThe study, published in PLOS One, should not be used to justify more lockdown measures, Yakusheva said. Nor is it a retroactive endorsement of the strict economic lockdown approach the United States imposed during the first six months of the pandemic.\n\n“We evaluated the full packet of public health measures as it was implemented in the beginning of the pandemic, but lesser mitigation measures may have worked just as well to reduce lives lost,” Yakusheva said. “The fact is, we just will never know. At the time, we had to work with the information that we had. We knew the pandemic was deadly, and we did not have therapeutics or a vaccine.”\n\nThe situation has changed dramatically since the pandemic began, and we have more tools to battle the virus, Yakusheva said. Vaccines and therapeutics are available, as are other mitigation measures.\n\nThis is the first known paper to measure the effect of pandemic lockdown mitigation measures on lives saved and lost, as opposed to typical economic evaluations, which examine the cost per life saved, she said.\n\n“This is tough for people to agree upon. Typically, people are in one of two camps — pragmatics who worry about the economy and ethicists who say any amount of money is worth saving a life,” Yakusheva said. “Some value loved ones more, or their own lives. It’s very subjective.\n\n“What we did was look at empirical correlations between loss of income and mortality, and created a range of estimates on how many people could be expected to die as a result of the downturn, which is essentially the estimated collateral damage of the public health measures. What our analysis did was to allow us an apples-to-apples comparison of lives saved vs. lives lost.”\n\nThere are important study limitations. Chief among them are that some answers to major questions were unobserved — for instance, how many lives would have been lost had COVID-19 been unmitigated. In other words, if it had just run its course with no public health measures in place.\n\n“We know how many people died with public health measures in place, but we can’t know how many people would have died without those measures in place,” Yakusheva said.\n\nThe team estimated that number based on published literature, and the accuracy of that literature, or the public’s behavior, could lead to an over or underestimate.\n\nAlso, all of the human toll of the lockdown won’t be seen immediately. For example, the health toll could manifest later as disease progression because someone who was unemployed couldn’t buy medications.\n\n“We tried to be very careful and produced a range of numbers of lives potentially saved and lost, and we hope the true numbers lie within those ranges,” Yakusheva said.'}}",100.0,1

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-did-it-robby-mook-michael-sussmann-donald-trump-russia-collusion-alfa-bank-11653084709', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton Did It - WSJ - The Wall Street Journal', 'Snippet': 'The Russia-Trump collusion narrative of 2016 and beyond was a dirty trick for the ages, and now we know it came from the top—candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.', 'Full_text': ''}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/15/politics/hillary-clinton-john-durham/index.html', 'Headline': 'Durham interviewed Hillary Clinton on alleged plan to tie Trump to ...', 'Snippet': 'Special counsel John Durham’s report released Monday details his investigation of a purported effort by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign to tie Donald Trump to Russia but which Durham concludes ...', 'Full_text': 'Special counsel John Durham’s report released Monday details his investigation of a purported effort by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign to tie Donald Trump to Russia but which Durham concludes “did not, all things considered, amount to a provable criminal offense.”\n\nDurham reveals in a footnote that he interviewed the former secretary of State in May 2022 as part of his investigation.\n\nThe special counsel was looking into whether any crimes occurred in the handling of an uncorroborated piece of US intelligence indicating Russia knew of a Clinton campaign plan to vilify her opponent, Trump, by tying him to the country.\n\nThe 2016 intelligence got the attention of then-CIA Director John Brennan, who briefed the Obama White House and referred the issue to the FBI.

During a full investigation:\n\nAn agent must have an “articulable factual basis” that a crime has or is about to occur in order to open the case. It’s a relatively high standard to open requiring more than merely an allegation of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nNo timeline for the investigation, but typically assessed by FBI supervisors annually to determine whether it should remain open.\n\nAll lawful tools, including intrusive surveillance allowed.\n\nBottom line, if the FBI had opened the investigation into the Trump-Russia probe as a preliminary vs. a full one, they would not have been permitted to use the host of FISA tools that ultimately became the subject of scrutiny by Durham, the Trump team, and DOJ’s inspector general. Opening the case as a preliminary investigation would have also limited the amount of information the FBI could collect as it sought to uncover potential ties between members of the Trump team and Russia.\n\nFormer Attorney General William Barr tapped special counsel John Durham in 2019 to review the origins of the Russia probe, and the scope of Durham’s work grew over the years.\n\nHe scrutinized the FBI’s handling of the Steele dossier, leaks of classified information about Trump-Russia contacts, and possible CIA misconduct regarding its analysis of Russian meddling, among other topics.\n\nLargely, his inquiry seemed to always zero in on former President Donald Trump’s political opponents and perceived enemies.\n\nWhen Durham began his probe, he was seen as an apolitical truth-seeker with a knack for investigating complex cases, including government scandals.\n\nBut that reputation waned over the years, especially after Durham took the unprecedented step of publicly rebuking the Justice Department inspector general after the watchdog released a report finding that the FBI’s decision to open the Trump-Russia probe was legally justified and untainted by bias.\n\nBoth Barr and Durham were publicly critical of the December 2019 inspector general report on the FBI’s Russia investigation.\n\nThat report contained blistering criticisms of FBI’s reliance on an unverified opposition research dossier on Trump and Russia and the FISA warrants that cited the dossier’s allegations, but Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote he did not find “documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the decisions” to open investigations that initially focused on four Trump campaign aides and advisers.\n\nFormer special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which inherited the initial Russia probe, released a detailed accounting of Russia’s effort to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nMueller found no evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but investigators documented numerous contacts between Trump associates and Russians.\n\nThe final Mueller report did not rely on the opposition research dossier.\n\nThe FBI has made reforms to the way it obtains warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in light of the inspector general’s report — which led to FBI invalidating two of the four warrants it obtained on the Trump campaign adviser – as well as a follow up investigation revealing widespread problems with FISA court applications.\n\nIn congressional testimony in 2020, FBI Director Chris Wray said that the FBI had implemented more than 40 changes aimed at making the FISA process more stringent in response to Horowitz’s report.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham scrutinized the FBI’s handling of the dossier, leaks of classified information about Trump-Russia contacts and possible CIA misconduct regarding its analysis of Russian meddling, among other topics during the course of his investigation.\n\nBut, he only pressed forward with two trials during his probe, both ending in acquittal.\n\nBefore the 2020 election, Barr elevated Durham to “special counsel” status, further protecting his position and making it politically difficult for the Biden-run Justice Department to control or shut down the investigation.\n\nDuring the trials, Trump and his allies continued to make bold predictions about what would be uncovered in the probe, particularly after Durham released vague allegations through court filings. Trump last year told Fox News that Durham was exposing the “crime of the century.”\n\nHis case against Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann ended with an acquittal in May. Durham charged Sussmann with lying to a top FBI official in September 2016 while passing along a tip about Trump’s ties to Russia. Sussmann’s lawyers accused Durham of bullying witnesses into changing their story and cherry-picking evidence to fuel claims of an anti-Trump conspiracy. After his acquittal, Sussmann said he was “falsely accused” by Durham.\n\nIn October, Durham personally oversaw his trial against Trump-Russia dossier source Igor Danchenko, who was charged with lying to the FBI about his sub-sourcing. Durham handled most of the arguments and witness questioning, but things quickly got off the rails.\n\nHe attacked his own witnesses when they helped the defense, and the judge threw out one of the five charges mid-trial. The Virginia jury reached “not guilty” verdicts on all remaining counts.\n\nJohn Durham, the special counsel who led the investigation into potential misconduct in the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe, has made a career of investigating high-profile public corruption.\n\nIn a 300-plus page report, the Trump administration appointee determined that the FBI should never have launched its investigation into connections between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, according to the report compiled over three years and released on Monday.\n\nDurham, 73, was appointed to serve as special counsel in October 2020 by then-Attorney General William Barr. He previously was the Justice Department’s top prosecutor in Connecticut — a position he was appointed to in 2017 and left in 2021.\n\nDurham became a lawyer in 1975. He is known for having handled high-profile, sensitive investigations in both Democratic and Republican administrations during his decadeslong career with the Justice Department.\n\nHe was appointed by then-Attorney General Janet Reno in 1999 to investigate corruption surrounding the use of FBI informants in Boston, and later by then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey to investigate the CIA’s destruction of videotapes of detainee interrogations in 2008. Durham closed the latter probe without bringing any charges.\n\nIn addition to his work as a special prosecutor, Durham has extensive experience as a trial lawyer. He went after gangs in New Haven, prosecuted mob figures, and secured a guilty plea from former Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, a Republican who admitted to corruption.\n\nThough the new special counsel report levies criticism after criticism of how the FBI handled the Trump-Russia probe, John Durham is not recommending “any wholesale changes” to the agency’s — or Justice Department — guidelines or policies.\n\nThe report, Durham writes, is meant to capture the findings of the special counsel investigation and to “assist the Attorney General in determining how the Department and the FBI can do a better, more credible job.”\n\nDurham however did float a proposal to create a career position for a nonpartisan FBI lawyer or agent who would be tasked with challenging steps taken in “politically sensitive investigations,” including surveillance warrant applications.\n\nDurham said he was not proposing any changes to FBI policies in a conclusion to the report’s executive summary, where he claimed that the FBI “failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to the law.”\n\nThe report asserts that “the answer is not the creation of new rules but a renewed fidelity to the old.”\n\nHis report says there is a need for the FBI to recognize that there was a “lack of analytical rigor, apparent confirmation bias, and an over-willingness to rely on information from individuals connected to political opponents.”\n\nThe FBI agents who worked on the surveillance applications for the Trump campaign aide Carter Page, Durham claims, showed “cavalier attitude towards accuracy and completeness,” as they allegedly disregarded requirements for renewing the warrants.\n\nFBI personnel, Durham writes, displayed a “serious lack of analytical rigor towards the information that they received, especially information received from politically affiliated persons and entities,” and that information contributed to both the launch the FBI’s initial probe and the opening of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.\n\n“The Department did not adequately examine or question these materials and the motivations of those providing them, even when at about the same time the Director of the FBI and others learned of significant and potentially contrary intelligence,” Durham writes.\n\nEven if hindsight is clearer, the report says, “much of this also seems to have been clear at the time.”\n\nUsing harsh language, special counsel John Durham claims in his report that the FBI deviated from his previous approach to foreign election interference matters in how it opened, with the Trump appointed-prosecutor touting how the FBI treated matters related to former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic White House nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nDurham zeroed in on former FBI Deputy Director Andre McCabe and Peter Strzok, the ex-deputy director of the counter-intelligence division,\n\n“Strzok, at a minimum, had pronounced hostile feelings toward Trump,” Durham wrote, while quoting in a footnote previously known texts between Strzok and Lisa Page, then an FBI attorney.\n\nDurham knocked the FBI for failing to take several steps before launching the Trump campaign investigations, such as interviewing relevant witnesses, reviewing its own intelligence databases, for or using “any of the standard analytical tools typically employed by the FBI in evaluating raw intelligence.”\n\nDurham suggested that if the FBI had taken those steps, it would have found that US intelligence agencies did not have any evidence tying Trump to Russian leadership officials.\n\nThe report cites for comparison examples of how the FBI approached investigations concerning Hillary Clinton. Durham points to specifically to “highly significant intelligence” the FBI “received from a trusted foreign source pointing to a Clinton campaign plan to vilify Trump by tying him to Vladimir Putin so as to divert attention from her own concerns relating to her use of a private email server.”\n\n“Unlike the FBI’s opening of a full investigation of unknown members of the Trump campaign based on raw, uncorroborated information, in this separate matter involving a purported Clinton campaign plan, the FBI never opened any type of inquiry, issued any taskings, employed any analytical personnel, or produced any analytical products in connection with the information,” the report said.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham’s report is critical of the Steele dossier, an explosive document that had been used by the FBI to bolster its case for probable cause to secure surveillance warrants against a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\n“As noted, it was not until mid-September that the Crossfire Hurricane investigators received several of the Steele Reports. Within days of their receipt, the unvetted and unverified Steele Reports were used to support probable cause in the FBI’s FISA applications targeting (Carter) Page, a U.S. citizen who, for a period of time, had been an advisor to Trump,” the report says.\n\n“As discussed later in the report, this was done at a time when the FBI knew that the same information Steele had provided to the FBI had also been fed to the media and others in Washington, D.C.,” it added.\n\nThe Steele dossier contained unverified allegations about Trump’s connections to Russia, including his alleged business dealings, rumors of lurid trysts in Moscow and claims that his campaign collaborated with the Kremlin in 2016.\n\nTrump vehemently denied the claims, and Steele’s work has lost a significant amount of credibility over the years. Today, the dossier is largely seen as an unproven collection of rumors and gossip.\n\n“As noted, the FBI attempted, over time, to investigate and analyze the Steele Reports but ultimately was not able to confirm or corroborate any of the substantive allegations contained in those reports. In the context of these efforts, and as discussed in (the report), the FBI learned that Steele relied primarily on a U.S.-based Russian national, Igor Danchenko, to collect information that ultimately formed the core allegations found in the reports,” the report reads.\n\n“Specifically, our investigation discovered that Danchenko himself had told another person that he (Danchenko) was responsible for 80% of the intel” and 50% of the analysis contained in the Steele Dossier,” it adds.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham concluded that the FBI should never have launched its full investigation into connections between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, according to a report compiled over three years by the Trump-administration appointee and released on Monday.\n\nDurham’s 300-plus page report also states that the FBI used “raw, unanalyzed, and uncorroborated intelligence,” to launch the “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation into Trump and Russia but used a different standard when weighing concerns about alleged election interference regarding Hillary Clinton’s campaign.\n\nThe special counsel, however, did not recommend any new charges against individuals or “wholesale changes” about how the FBI handles politically charged investigations, despite strongly criticizing the agency’s behavior.\n\nThe report also concludes that “at least on the part of certain personnel intimately involved in the matter” there was “a predisposition to open an investigation into Trump.”\n\nDurham’s findings that the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign should not have happened are at odds with a previous Justice Department inspector general investigation into the FBI’s Russia probe, which identified problems with the investigation but concluded in December 2019 there was sufficient justification to open the inquiry.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland sent Durham’s report to congressional lawmakers and released the report on Monday.\n\nIn a letter to Congress accompanying the report, Garland said, “Special Counsel Durham’s unclassified report is attached in full as submitted to me, without any additions, redactions, or other modifications.”\n\nDurham’s conclusions condemning the FBI’s investigation into Trump is sure to fuel the debate about Russia, Trump, the FBI and the 2016 presidential election that is still swirling more than six years after and as Trump is campaigning once again for the White House.\n\nThe investigation was launched in May 2019 by Trump’s former Attorney General William Barr — a probe that Trump and his right-wing allies repeatedly predicted would “investigate the investigators” and lead to bombshell indictments of those who scrutinized the former president. Four years later, Durham’s investigation yielded one minor conviction, two losses at trial and a probe that fell short of the lofty goals set by the former president.\n\nDurham only secured one conviction: the guilty plea of a low-level FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, who avoided jail after admitting to doctoring an email about a surveillance warrant. Durham’s other two prosecutions — against a Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer and the primary source for the Trump-Russia dossier — ended with embarrassing acquittals.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham has released a report on his office’s investigation into wrongdoing in the Trump-Russia probe.\n\nThe FBI opened the initial Russia investigation, codenamed “Crossfire Hurricane,” in late July 2016. Special counsel Robert Mueller inherited that investigation in May 2017, and he wrapped up his work in March 2019. In all, that means the Justice Department spent about two years and eight months investigating the connections between Trump’s campaign and the Russian government.\n\nAs Mueller wrapped up his work in the spring of 2019, then-Attorney General Bill Barr tapped Durham to “investigate the investigators” and review the origins of the FBI’s Russia probe\n\nBarr upgraded Durham to “special counsel” status shortly before the 2020 election, making it politically harder for the incoming Biden-run Justice Department to shut down Durham’s team if they wanted to. Garland has let Durham continue, despite complaints from liberal commentators and Durham’s targets that he is twisting the law in furtherance of a Trump-friendly political agenda.\n\nProsecutions: In all, Durham has prosecuted just three people: Igor Danchenko, a Russian analyst who was a source for the 2016 dossier of allegations about Trump, the acquitted Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann and a low-level FBI lawyer named Kevin Clinesmith.\n\nThere are reports that Durham’s team also looked into a wide range of other matters that former President Donald Trump has publicly complained about – without bringing any charges. This includes potential wrongdoing by the CIA and other parts of the US intelligence community, on topics related to Russia’s pro-Trump interference in the 2016 election.\n\nDurham’s team has spent nearly $4.5 million since October 2020, according to financial data released by the Justice Department. The cost of Durham’s first year and half of work, when he was a US attorney and not a special counsel, has not been disclosed.'}}",89.58333333333333,1

Donald J. Trump is a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States and current president-elect. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels as hush money to buy her silence over a sexual encounter between them; with costs related to the transaction included, the payments totaled $420,000. The Manhattan District Attorney (DA), Alvin Bragg, accused Trump of falsifying these business records with the intent to commit other crimes: violation of federal campaign finance limits, unlawfully influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and tax fraud.[a]\n\nThe indictment, the first of a former U.S. president, was approved by a Manhattan grand jury on March 30, 2023. On April 3, Trump traveled from his residence in Florida to New York City, where he surrendered to the Manhattan DA\'s office and was arraigned the next day. Trump pleaded not guilty and stated that he would continue to campaign for the 2024 presidential election, even if convicted. The trial began on April 15, 2024. On April 30, Trump also became the first U.S. president to be held in criminal contempt of court, due to comments he made earlier in the month about individuals involved with the trial.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Trump\'s 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the payment of hush money to Daniels through Trump\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who was reimbursed via a false retainer agreement. The prosecution rested on May 20, 2024, after calling 20 witnesses. The defense argued that Trump was unaware of any allegedly unlawful scheme, that Cohen was unreliable as a witness, and that the retainer agreement between them was valid. The defense rested on May 21 after calling two witnesses. Throughout proceedings, the defense also made unsuccessful requests for the case to be delayed or dismissed, for the judge to recuse himself, and for a mistrial.\n\nTrump was convicted on all counts on May 30, 2024, becoming the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Sentencing is scheduled for November 26. Trump has said that he will appeal the ruling.\n\nBackground\n\nStormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn July 2006, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known professionally as ""Stormy Daniels"", met Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. At the time, Trump was the host of the reality TV series The Apprentice and was married to Melania Trump.[4] According to Daniels, Trump invited her to his penthouse at Harrah\'s Lake Tahoe[5] where the two had sex and talked about making her a guest on The Apprentice.[6][7]\n\nIn 2011, Daniels considered selling the story to the celebrity magazine Life & Style for US$15,000 as Trump began exploring a potential presidential bid. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened to sue Life & Style when it asked the Trump Organization for comment. Daniels\' agent, Gina Rodriguez, leaked the story to the gossip blog The Dirty in October. The post was taken down following complaints by Trump\'s lawyers, and Daniels disputed the story\'s veracity.[8] Cohen acknowledged during court testimony in May 2024 that he advised for the story\'s removal.[9]\n\nAs Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign began, Rodriguez approached multiple publications—including the National Enquirer—and attempted to sell the story. Following the publication of a controversial recording of Trump and Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, the National Enquirer sought to suppress the story. Rather than paying Daniels, the National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard negotiated a $130,000 non-disclosure agreement between Daniels and Michael Cohen. Cohen attempted to find the money as the election neared and repeatedly delayed her payment. Keith Davidson, Daniels\' lawyer, canceled the deal in October 2016.[5][8]\n\nUltimately, Cohen drew the money from his home equity line of credit and sent it through a shell company incorporated in Delaware.[5][8] Trump initially denied knowing about the check made out to Daniels. In April 2018, aboard Air Force One, he told a reporter he did not know where Cohen got the money.[10] Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post described this statement as a lie,[11] as Trump had personally reimbursed Cohen for the payment.[12][11][13] Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, also refuted Trump\'s claims in a Fox News interview, saying that Trump was aware of the payments.[14]\n\nTrump wrote several checks totaling $420,000 to Cohen. The checks reimbursed him for the non-disclosure agreement and covered the costs for Cohen to manipulate online polls to boost Trump\'s status. The $180,000 paid to Cohen was doubled to offset taxes, and $60,000 was added. These payments were made throughout 2017, during Trump\'s first year of presidency.[15] The payments made to Cohen were declared as a legal expense.[16] Nine monthly checks from Trump to Cohen, dated April to December 2017, exist as evidence.[17]\n\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported on Cohen\'s payment to Daniels.[18] Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts relating to the payment—as well as another payment made to Karen McDougal—in August. In his admission of guilt, Cohen stated that he acted ""at the direction of a candidate for federal office"", implicating Trump.[19][20] In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison.[21]\n\nOn May 2, 2024, The Daily Beast broke a story that Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg had assisted the 2016 campaign with its finance reports.[22]\n\nManhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nFollowing Cohen\'s August 2018 admission of guilt, Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance Jr. opened an investigation against the Trump Organization and two of its executives.[23] The office paused its inquiry when the office of the federal U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York began a separate investigation into the payments,[24] but the federal inquiry concluded without charges in July 2019.[25][b]\n\nThe Manhattan DA\'s office then issued a subpoena for the Trump Organization in August, seeking documents relating to the payments.[27] Additionally, the office subpoenaed accounting firm Mazars USA, demanding eight years of Trump\'s corporate tax returns.[28] Trump\'s lawyers sued Vance to block the subpoena, citing Trump\'s immunity from criminal inquiries as the president of the United States.[29] In Trump v. Vance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7–2 in favor of Vance, allowing the subpoena to continue.[30]\n\nFollowing the 2021 New York County District Attorney election, Alvin Bragg succeeded Vance as the Manhattan DA.[31] In early 2021, Mark Pomerantz, a Manhattan prosecutor, sought to revive the case under the theory that if Daniels had extorted Trump, the money would be criminal proceeds, and efforts to conceal its source would constitute money laundering.[32] On further examination, Pomerantz found that the money laundering statute would not apply, and colleagues were skeptical that the hush money would qualify as extortion.[32] With no path to felony charges, Pomerantz abandoned the inquiry and subsequently resigned in February 2022.[32] In January 2023, the Manhattan DA\'s office impaneled a grand jury, and began presenting evidence of Trump\'s role in the Stormy Daniels payment.[33] Cohen met extensively with the DA\'s office and the grand jury,[34][35][36] and by March 3, Cohen had met with the DA\'s office 18 times[37][38][39] and had given his cellphones to the DA\'s prosecutors, who wanted evidence of communications including voice recordings of Daniels\' former lawyer Keith Davidson.[40] Several other witnesses met with the DA\'s office or the grand jury in March 2023, including Kellyanne Conway,[41] Hope Hicks, two Trump Organization employees, two former National Enquirer executives who helped broker the hush-money deal, a lawyer for Daniels,[42][43] Daniels herself,[44] Trump-aligned lawyer Robert Costello (who provided testimony, including emails, in which he attempted to discredit Cohen\'s reliability),[45][46] and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.[47][48][c] As early as that February, prosecutors confirmed that they might leverage additional charges, including insurance fraud, against Allen Weisselberg to pressure him to testify against Trump,[51] and in May, The New York Times reported that they were considering perjury charges against him.[52]\n\nIn March 2023, District Attorney Alvin Bragg\'s office indicated that an indictment was likely.[53] By March 9, 2023, prosecutors had offered Trump a chance to testify before the grand jury the following week, indicating that they were likely preparing to indict him.[54][55] Around that time, Trump and his spokesperson began referring to both Daniels\' allegation and the DA\'s proceedings as ""extortion"".[56] On March 10, 2023, Trump\'s lawyer Joe Tacopina asked New York City\'s Department of Investigation to review the criminal probe, asserting its ""weaponization"".[57] On March 13, Tacopina announced that Trump would not testify.[58] Early the next morning, The Guardian reported that Trump\'s lawyers had argued to the DA that Trump should not be indicted on the basis that the payment did not draw from campaign funds and would have been made regardless of his candidacy.[59]\n\nIn late March 2023, there was reporting around Daniels having reportedly unsuccessfully communicated in 2018 with Tacopina about possibly representing her in the scandal, for which the DA could move to disqualify the lawyer due to attorney–client privilege and because she reputedly disclosed confidential information to his firm.[60][61][62][63] Additionally, it reemerged that, in 2018, Tacopina had called the hush-money payment ""an illegal agreement"", ""a fraud"", and ""a potential campaign finance issue"".[60]\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Trump claimed on his social-media platform, Truth Social, that he was to be arrested on March 21[d][e] and that the proceedings were disinformation backed by President Joe Biden, calling for protests in anticipation of a possible indictment.[66][67][68][69][70] Law enforcement and security agencies prepared for potential reactions to an indictment of Trump that week, especially in the areas of the Manhattan Criminal Court and Trump Tower, including by monitoring online threats.[69][71][72][f] New York City Police began to increase security in preparation for the expected indictment on March 21, and a second time for the second expected indictment on March 30.[74] Metal barriers were set up around Trump Tower and the district Criminal Court Building.[75] On March 24, Trump, citing his presidential prospects, insinuated that ""potential death & destruction"" could result from Bragg\'s allegedly false charge.[76][g]\n\nTrump has called the investigation a ""witch hunt"", claiming political persecution.[81] Trump proponents have referred to the case as harassment, calling it a ""political hack job"".[82] The trial and accompanying political theatrics have been described as a ""circus"" by the media.[83][84][85] Due to multiple investigation revivals, the case earned the moniker of ""zombie case"".[32][86]\n\nEligibility for president\n\nThe Article II of the U.S. Constitution does not have any rules blocking presidential candidates with criminal records.[87] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier in Trump v. Anderson that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking the prohibition in section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which states ""no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US"".[88]\n\nInitial proceedings\n\nIndictment and charges\n\nThe Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on March 30, 2023.[89] The indictment was filed with the New York Supreme Court (the ordinary trial court for felonies in the state of New York and not the final court of appeal for the state) the same day.[90] The charges were under seal until published when Trump was arraigned.[91][92]\n\nThe indictment charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law §175.10.[93][94] Each count is related to a specific business document, each having a date ranging from February 14 through December 5, 2017:[95]\n\n11 for invoices from Michael Cohen\n\n9 for general ledger entries for Donald J. Trump\n\n9 for checks from Donald J. Trump\n\n3 for general ledger entries for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\n2 for checks from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\nThe allegedly falsified documents are related to Trump\'s payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money. The payments were listed in the business records as a legal expense payable to Michael Cohen, whereas the indictment alleges that they were actually to reimburse Cohen for the earlier, allegedly illicit, payment to Daniels.[96][97]\n\nFalsifying business records in the first degree is a felony under New York state law that requires that the ""intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof"". This is in contrast to falsifying business records in the second degree, which is a misdemeanor that does not have that requirement.[95][96][97] The charges neither include, nor even identify, the additional crimes, constituting a relatively unusual strategy for the DA:[98][95]\n\nA New York Times analysis of about 30 false business records cases brought by Mr. Bragg and his predecessor — based on court records, interviews and information the office provided — shows that in this respect, the case against Mr. Trump stands apart. In all but two of the indictments reviewed by The Times, the defendant was charged with an additional crime on top of the false records charge.\n\nIn later filings, Bragg listed (but still did not charge) three general types of crime that Trump allegedly intended to commit: violation of federal campaign finance limits, violation of state election laws by unlawfully influencing the 2016 election, and violation of state tax laws regarding the reimbursement.[99] Trump could have moved to allow the jury to convict on the misdemeanor charges as a lesser included offense, but he did not.[100][101]\n\nEach count for which Trump was convicted could result in a prison sentence of up to four years, to be served consecutively, with a maximum sentence of 20 years.[102][95][103][104] He is permitted to assume the presidency even should he be in prison.[105] The judge may also choose to impose no prison sentence.[106]\n\nThe conviction did not legally prohibit Trump from continuing his campaign in the 2024 presidential election, which he won.[105] (Trump had stated in an April 2023 Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson that he would continue his candidacy even if convicted.)[107][108]\n\nArraignment\n\nTrump was arraigned on April 4, 2023. A law enforcement source told Reuters that police would close streets around the courthouse in advance of Trump\'s expected appearance.[109] On April 3, Trump flew from Palm Beach International Airport into LaGuardia Airport on his private plane, and took his motorcade to Trump Tower, where he stayed the night.[110][111] Todd Blanche, a lawyer who had defended Paul Manafort during his 2016 fraud trial, had recently resigned from his law firm to aid Trump\'s case.[112] Police increased security in and around Manhattan ahead of the arraignment; authorities said there were no credible threats of violence or organized plans of protests.[111] Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, warned protestors to be peaceful.[113] Acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is presiding over the case.[114] Merchan denied a motion filed by media organizations to allow a television broadcast of the arraignment or to allow electronic devices to be used in the courtroom, but allowed five press pool still photographers.[115][116] Courtroom sketch artists also documented the proceedings.[117] The courtroom\'s glass doors were covered as a security measure.[118]\n\nUpon entering the courthouse, he was put in police custody and placed under arrest.[119][120] He was booked and fingerprinted, but he was not handcuffed, nor was a mug shot taken.[121][122] Trump entered the courtroom an hour later,[123] pleading not guilty to 34 felony charges.[124] The indictment was unsealed (publicly released) shortly thereafter, charging Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree as part of a ""conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election"".[125][126] This marked the first indictment of a former U.S. president.[127][128][129] At the arraignment, Merchan warned Trump not to use social media to incite violence.[130]\n\nPossible trial dates were discussed; prosecutors proposed January 2024, but Trump\'s defense team objected, saying that the trial should be set for later in 2024.[131]\n\nImmediately after the arraignment, Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago and addressed a crowd of supporters in the evening.[132][110] Trump made several false claims about topics such as his handling of government documents, District Attorney Bragg, and the Trump–Raffensperger phone call.[133]\n\nPre-trial proceedings\n\nDuring Trump\'s arraignment, the court set deadlines for pre-trial proceedings, including for prosecutors to provide discovery to the defense.[131] The court set a deadline of August 8, 2023, for pre-trial motions to be filed.[131]\n\nAs he had done in other cases, Trump used ""attack-and-delay"" tactics, targeting the prosecutors and the judge while prolonging proceedings, with the aim that the case might continue into late 2024, near the presidential election.[134][135]\n\nTrump\'s lawyers maintained that he was unaware of any allegedly unlawful schemes that his allies or associates may have engaged in.[136] On March 12, 2024, the defense team filed their strategy writing ""President Trump lacked the requisite intent to commit the conduct charged in the Indictment because of his awareness that various lawyers were involved in the underlying conduct giving rise to the charges.""[137] The defense counsel stated that they would not invoke the formal ""advice of counsel"" defense, but that Trump would ""elicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges"".[137][138][h]\n\nRequest for indictment dismissal\n\nOn September 29, 2023, Trump\'s team submitted omnibus motions to dismiss the indictment and requesting clarification of the charges.[140]\n\nOn April 27, Trump\'s team had asked for the charges to be explained in full.[141] It was possible that the second crime(s) would eventually be specified in a bill of particulars,[142] but according to a governing appeals case from c. 1980 this is not necessary.[143] On May 16, the DA\'s office argued that it did not need to elaborate further on the basis that Trump already ""has more than sufficient information to prepare his defense"", while reiterating possible secondary charges.[144][145][i] Trump\'s team was reportedly considering invoking a 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision which emphasizes the importance of specifying punishable criminal charges; additionally, a 1999 decision states that ""any fact ... that increases the maximum penalty for [one] crime must be charged in an indictment ... and proved"".[141]\n\nOn February 15, 2024, the court denied the motions to dismiss.[146][147][148] However, the court did partially grant Trump\'s request seeking clarification of the charges. Trump is not only accused of falsifying business records, but doing so with the intention to commit or conceal some other crime. Holding it would be unfair to expect Trump to prepare a defense to a newly raised theory mid-trial, the court limited the prosecution to just three theories of ""other crimes"" that had already been identified during pre-trial procedure.[146][149]\n\nDiscovery materials and witnesses\n\nAs of Trump\'s arraignment on April 4, 2023, it was expected that the discovery process would take several months.[150]\n\nOn April 17, 2023, the DA\'s office requested that Merchan obtain further information from Tacopina, including his firm\'s correspondence with Daniels, to determine whether their history constituted a conflict of interest.[63] On September 1, Merchan ruled that it did not.[151]\n\nOn May 4, Merchan heard arguments about the DA office\'s request to restrict information it turns over to Trump\'s lawyers from being shared with Trump himself (at least until the trial), citing his past social-media posts attacking Bragg and witnesses. The defense has argued that the government should be equally restrained from discussing information publicly and that Trump should be allowed to defend himself politically.[152][153] On May 8, Merchan ruled in favor of the order, barring evidence from being shared on social media.[154] The judge instructed Trump and his lawyers on their conduct on May 23, informing them that violations could incur a ""wide range of sanctions"" including being held in contempt of court.[155]\n\nOn May 26, prosecutors stated that they had informed Trump\'s lawyers that evidence in the hush-money case includes various audio recordings, including one of Trump and a witness. It was unclear if this was in reference to secretly recorded audio from September 2016 which Cohen had previously released.[156][157][158][159]\n\nOn August 3, federal judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversaw E. Jean Carroll\'s civil lawsuits against Trump alleging sexual assault and defamation,[j] ruled that Carroll\'s lawyers could provide video of Trump being deposed to Manhattan prosecutors.[162]\n\nOn January 15, 2024, Tacopina withdrew from Trump\'s counsel[163] and Daniels said she expected to testify.[164] Later in the month, the DA was reportedly beginning to meet with witnesses ahead of the trial.[165]\n\nOn March 18, the judge ruled that both Daniels and Cohen could testify, placing some restrictions on Daniels (as well as Karen McDougal). The defense had requested that the two be blocked from testifying the previous month. Additionally, the judge ruled that Trump\'s Access Hollywood tape could not be played during the trial but that it could be discussed.[166]\n\nOn April 22, Merchan ruled on what prosecutors may ask Trump if he testified,[167] following a pretrial Sandoval hearing held on April 19.[168][169][170]\n\nOn May 10, Judge Juan Merchan suggested that Allen Weisselberg could be called to testify in court after the defense objected to the prosecution\'s plan to show the jury a $750,000 severance agreement.[171] Neither the defense nor the prosecution had subpoenaed Weisselberg, and there were procedural concerns about adding him to the witness list so late in the trial.[171] Furthermore, Weisselberg\'s testimony could be in violation of the non-disparagement clause of his severance agreement and he would likely invoke the fifth amendment.[172][173]\n\nRequests for recusal\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, who has experience with financial cases,[174] was randomly assigned to oversee the grand jury proceedings in Trump\'s case, and continued to oversee handling of the charges approved by the grand jury.[175]\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers filed a motion asking Judge Merchan to recuse himself from the case citing his daughter\'s position as partner and COO of Authentic Campaigns, a consulting firm that serviced Biden\'s 2020 presidential campaign. The motion additionally alleged that Merchan had encouraged former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg to cooperate with the prosecution against Trump in a previous case he had presided over, and that Merchan had made three $10–15 donations to various Democratic causes.[176][177][k] On June 20, the DA\'s office argued against the recusal request, citing Trump\'s alleged ""prolific history of baselessly accusing state and federal judges around the country of bias"", saying he seemed to be trying to land a more favorable judge. Prosecutors further argued that there was a lack of hard evidence that a particular trial result would aid Merchan directly or greatly via his daughter\'s Democratic work,[180] which a state ethics panel had similarly concluded in early May.[181][l] The court denied the motion on August 11, 2023.[185]\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the defense asked Merchan for permission to file a motion repeating their prior request that he recuse himself for what the defense said was a conflict of interest due to his daughter\'s Democratic involvement.[186] On April 1, the New York City Bar Association issued a statement of ""unequivocal support"" for Merchan\'s handling of the recusal concerns.[m] On April 2, prosecutors pointed out that the court and an ethics panel had already found that the political activities of a relative are not grounds for questioning a judge\'s impartiality.[188][n]\n\nThe same day, Trump posted a Fox & Friends clip in which co-host Brian Kilmeade criticized the judge\'s daughter, although Trump highlighted another commentator\'s statement.[191] As of April 3, Trump had not deleted offending posts made prior to Merchan\'s expanded order;[192] that night, he linked to a report by far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Merchan\'s daughter and wife.[193] On April 5, Trump\'s campaign publicized their motion for Merchan to recuse himself (dated April 3),[188] which asserts numerous counts of bias, and falsely cites the state Office of Court Administration (OCA) as saying Merchan\'s daughter deleted her X account in April 2023, around when the judge ""solicited an ethics opinion regarding recusal in a letter ... that the Court declined to disclose"".[194][181][195][o][p]\n\nOn April 6, Trump posted online that if arrested for violating the gag order, he would consider it a ""great honor"" to ""become a Modern Day Nelson Mandela"", the former South African president jailed for anti-apartheid activism.[201] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked an appeals court to delay the trial and pause the gag order while they appeal the latter; this was denied the following day.[202][203] On April 10, an appeals judge denied another defense delay request which was based on Merchan having not yet ruled on the recusal motion.[204][202] On April 15, Merchan denied the recusal motion.[205] On April 30, an appellate court denied requests for both a recusal and a stay of proceedings.[206]\n\nRequest for removal to federal court\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers asked for the case to be moved to a federal court (though it would remain a state-law prosecution conducted by the Manhattan DA), arguing that it involved alleged conduct somehow ""performed while in office""—despite the potential federal election-law violations not being specified and occurring prior to Trump\'s inauguration.[153][145][q] As proceedings continued in the New York Supreme Court,[207] Bragg asked for the removal request to be dismissed, arguing that Trump had failed to establish that he was an officer of the United States during his presidency,[208][209] to which the defense expounded its initial argument.[210][153] Even if the case had been moved to federal court, New York state law would have continued to apply.[211]\n\nIn a hearing on June 27, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein opined that Trump\'s conduct likely did not constitute presidential activity.[212] On July 19, arguing that the matter was apparently a personal ""cover-up of an embarrassing event"", Hellerstein ruled that the case should remain in state court.[213] Trump appealed the decision on July 28,[214] but withdrew this on November 14.[215]\n\nTrial scheduling\n\nOn May 23, 2023, Justice Merchan set the trial for March 25, 2024.[216] Trump\'s team complained that he expected to have multiple trials around that time. Merchan said he would discuss rescheduling to another time.[217] At a February 15, 2024, hearing, which Trump attended,[218] Merchan reaffirmed the March 25 trial date.[219]\n\nIn early February 2024, Trump\'s federal election obstruction trial, originally set for early March, was postponed pending appeals, increasing the likelihood of the Manhattan criminal trial taking place as planned on March 25, 2024.[220][221]\n\nOn March 11, 2024, Trump\'s lawyers requested a delay of trial until after the federal election obstruction case on the basis that it would bolster his argument of presidential immunity, as some evidence and allegedly some acts overlapped with his time in office.[222] Trump\'s team cited, from April 2018, Trump\'s denying knowledge of the hush-money payment to reporters and tweeting in defense of Cohen\'s credibility.[223] Later on March 11, Merchan pointed out that Trump\'s team had missed the filing deadline and said either party would need his permission to file additional pretrial motions.[222] On March 3, the judge dismissed the request as untimely.[224]\n\nAlso on March 11, Trump asked to delay trial until after the Supreme Court decides whether he is generally immune from prosecution in the federal charges on election obstruction. Granting the motion would have delayed trial until mid-summer or later, as the Supreme Court had already scheduled those arguments for April 25[225] and may not rule until the end of the court\'s term in early July.[226] Merchan denied the motion on April 3,[227] saying that he doubted its ""sincerity and actual purpose"", given that Trump made this request only two weeks before trial.[228]\n\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office provided prosecutors with approximately 170,000 pages of documents, largely related to the 2017 federal probe of Cohen\'s payment to Daniels (and mostly reflecting evidence already turned over to Trump\'s lawyers in June 2023).[229][230][231] Trump\'s lawyers sought a delay in the trial on the basis of the newly produced records; the DA\'s office said in court that only 300 of the documents were relevant to Trump\'s defense.[232] On March 15, 2024, the judge delayed the start of trial until mid-April.[233] On March 25, 2024, the judge set a trial date of April 15, and denied a motion by Trump\'s team to further delay the trial.[232] On May 23, 2024, Merchan denied Trump\'s request to sanction prosecutors regarding the document release, ruling that the defense was provided sufficient time to respond.[234]\n\nOn March 18, Trump\'s team requested an additional delay on the basis that pretrial publicity and apparent anti-Trump bias in Manhattan would prohibit a fair jury from being selected in April, although only 35% in the cited poll said they were convinced Trump was guilty in the DA\'s case specifically. Trump\'s lawyers cited berating statements by Cohen, e.g. saying he served jail time because his ""lying"" former boss ""couldn\'t keep his mushroom dick in his pants"". On March 25, the assistant DA countered that ""publicity is not likely to abate [and] the pretrial publicity has been ... exacerbated by the defendant"".[235] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked the appeals court for a delay to allow an attempt to move the trial to a different county, which was denied the same day.[202]\n\nOn April 8, Trump requested to postpone the trial so the court could consider a change of venue, which was denied the same day,[236] and so he could appeal the gag order, which was denied the next day.[237] On April 10, the appeals court denied Trump\'s request to postpone trial on the basis of Merchan being unqualified.[238] On April 12, Merchan denied the defendant\'s request to delay trial on the basis of ""prejudicial"" media coverage.[239] On April 15, Merchan said Trump was ""required to be here"" on April 25 and ""not required to be at the Supreme Court"" that day, when it would hear arguments on his immunity claim in the federal election case.[240] Merchan said he was not yet prepared to say whether trial would be held on May 17 to allow Trump to attend his son Barron\'s high-school graduation, but indicated that he probably would grant him the day off if the proceedings progressed at an expected pace.[241] Trump subsequently complained that he would ""not be allowed"" to attend the graduation, but on April 30 the judge said he would be able to do so.[242] On May 17, Donald and Melania Trump attended their son\'s graduation from Oxbridge Academy at West Palm Beach, followed by a visit to Lincoln Reagan Dinner at the 2024 annual Minnesota Republican convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[243]\n\nGag order\n\nIn a May 2023 hearing and court filing, prosecutors expressed concern that Trump would misuse evidence obtained through pretrial discovery procedure to attack people involved in the case, including witnesses.[211] Justice Merchan declined to issue a gag order or prohibit Trump from publicly commenting about the case against him,[211] but issued a protective order setting rules for the use of social media involving elements of the case, and set a hearing (with Trump to appear remotely) to explain the rules.[244][245]\n\nAt Trump\'s arraignment, on April 4, 2023, Merchan instructed Blanche to ""speak to your client and anybody else you need to, and remind them to please refrain, please refrain from making statements that are likely to incite violence or civil unrest. Please refrain from making comments or engaging in conduct that has the potential to incite violence, create civil unrest, or jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals.""[246] Blanche had stated that Trump was ""frustrated, upset, and believes that there is a grave injustice happening with him being in this courtroom today"" which Merchan rebuked ""I don\'t share your view that certain language and certain rhetoric is just by frustration.""[246] Merchan did not seek to impose a gag order at the time.[247]\n\nOn February 26, 2024, the Manhattan DA asked for a gag order on Trump, noting that Trump has been fined $15,000 for two violations of a gag order in the civil fraud trial by disparaging the judge\'s law clerk on social media, and reporting that police had logged 89 threats to Bragg, his family, or staff in 2023 (as opposed to a single threat in 2022).[248] On March 7, Merchan ruled that the jury would be anonymous except to some involved in the trial, including Trump, his lawyers, and prosecutors.[249] On March 26, Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump, restricting what he could say publicly about people involved in the case.[250] Additionally, the judge warned the defense, under the threat of contempt, against dilatory tactics such as the late filing of pretrial motions or last-minute demands, pointing out that Trump had ""stated publicly that the defense goal is to delay these proceedings ... past the 2024 presidential election"".[251][252] On March 26, Trump made online posts attacking the judge, the gag order, and Merchan\'s daughter, the latter over an anti-Trump social-media post created by someone impersonating her on social media.[253][254][255] The same day, Merchan imposed a gag order forbidding Trump to publicly comment on court staff, prosecutors, prospective jurors, or their families, or to cause others to make such statements, in a way that interferes with the case. Bragg (as a public figure) and Merchan (as the judge) were specifically exempted from protection.[256][257] The court also ordered Trump not to comment on prospective trial witnesses concerning their potential participation in the criminal case.[258]\n\nOn March 27 and 28, Trump again attacked Merchan\'s daughter on social media.[257][259] On March 29, prosecutors requested that the limits of the gag order be explicated regarding family of court staff in hopes of terminating what they considered intentionally defiant behavior by Trump.[254][260] On April 1, Merchan expanded the gag order to protect his and Bragg\'s family members, saying attacks on them ""serve no legitimate purpose"".[261][262] He wrote that Trump\'s continued attacks posted a ""very real"" threat to the integrity of proceedings and could cause those involved in the case to fear for themselves and their families, which would ""undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself"".[263] On April 11, Trump disparaged expected witnesses Cohen and Daniels on social media, referring to them as dishonest ""sleaze bags"".[258] On May 6, Merchan found Trump in contempt of court for the tenth time, but stated that he did not wish to jail Trump due to the fact that Trump was a former and potentially the next president.[264]\n\nContempt hearings were later held concerning numerous alleged violations of the gag order. On May 14, a New York appeals court denied Trump\'s request to overturn the order.[265]\n\nAlso on May 14, United States Senator Tommy Tuberville called the gag order ""ridiculous"" for stopping Trump ""from having a say-so in his own trial""; Tuberville further said that members of Congress were attending the trial ""to speak our piece for President Trump"" and ""overcome this gag order"", and he hoped that ""more and more"" members of Congress would do so.[266] Republican members of Congress, including Tuberville, JD Vance, Cory Mills, Nicole Malliotakis and Speaker Mike Johnson, have criticized witness Michael Cohen, while Byron Donalds, Rick Scott, Vance, and Johnson have criticized Merchan\'s daughter.[267][268][269][270] New York magazine journalist Andrew Rice claimed that during Cohen\'s May 13 testimony, he saw Trump penning revision notes as to statements about the case from his Republican allies.[271] On May 14, Trump commented that ""I do have a lot of surrogates, and they\'re speaking very beautifully.""[272]\n\nOn May 20, speaking outside the courtroom, Trump mentioned witnesses Robert Costello and Michael Cohen.[273]\n\nOn June 25, Merchan lifted parts of Trump\'s gag order, allowing him to talk about the jury and witnesses who took the stand during the trial.[274] Merchan also stated that the gag order would be completely lifted following sentencing.[275]\n\nStatute of limitations\n\nIn New York, the statute of limitations is typically two years for misdemeanors and five years for felonies.[276] Though falsifying business records is typically a misdemeanor, in New York, the charges are upgraded to a felony when used to commit or conceal another crime.[276] Trump was charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, which is a Class E felony (the least severe), whose statute of limitations is five years.[276] On March 20, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued Executive Order No. 202.8 tolling (pausing) the statute of limitations for ""any specific time limit for the commencement, filing, or service of any legal action, notice, motion, or other process or proceeding, as prescribed by the procedural laws of the state"".[276]\n\nMerchan ruled the tolling deadline was through May 6, 2021, thus extending the deadline for the prosecution by one year and 47 days, allowing the felony prosecution to commence within 6 years and 47 days from when the crime was committed.[276] Trump\'s first indictment occurred on February 14, 2017, and the indictment was filed on March 3, 2023, within days of the deadline.[276] On February 14, 2024, Merchan ruled that the tolled period was sufficient.[276]\n\nThe New York statute of limitations provision, CPL§30.10, permits tolling of up to five years while the defendant is continuously outside the state.[276] During his presidency, Trump spent the majority of his time outside New York.[276] Merchan declined to address where this provision was applicable as the tolling occasioned by the Governor\'s Executive Order was sufficient.[277]\n\nOverview of witnesses\n\nProsecution witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Witness Date Function David Pecker April 22 Publisher of National Enquirer April 23 April 25 April 26 Rhona Graff April 26 Donald Trump executive assistant April 30 Gary Farro April 30 First Republic banker Robert Browning April 30 C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Phillip Thompson April 30 Regional Director of Esquire Deposition Solutions Keith Davidson April 30 Former attorney for Stormy Daniels May 2 Douglas Daus May 2 Computer forensics specialist in the Manhattan DA\'s office Hope Hicks May 3 Former White House Communications Director Jeffrey McConney May 6 Former Trump Organization comptroller Deborah Tarasoff May 6 Trump Organization accounting employee Sally Franklin May 7 Penguin Books executive Stormy Daniels May 7 Hush money recipient May 9 Rebecca Manochio May 9 Trump Organization bookkeeper Tracey Menzies May 9 Senior vice president at HarperCollins Madeleine Westerhout May 9 Former Director of Oval Office Operations May 10 Jennie Tomalin May 10 Verizon senior analyst Daniel Dixon May 10 AT&T compliance analyst Jaden Jarmel-Schneider May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Georgia Longstreet May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Michael Cohen May 13 Hush money intermediary May 14 May 16 May 20\n\nDefense witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Date Witness Function Daniel Sitko May 20 Paralegal for defense attorney Robert Costello May 20 Associate of Michael Cohen May 21\n\nTrial\n\nThe trial began on April 15, 2024, with recessed Wednesdays.[278] Trump was required to attend every day of trial barring a court-approved absence.[279] If he chose to testify, prosecutors could have asked him about his civil lawsuits regarding business fraud, sexual abuse, and defamation as well as the 2018 dissolution of his charitable foundation.[280] Attorneys Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles represented him.[281]\n\nThe trial was not televised.[282] Initially, Merchan allowed photographers to stand at the front of the room for a few minutes each morning before the trial began to take photos of Trump seated. Merchan withdrew this permission on May 9 after at least one photo was taken from the side of the table.[283] There are courtroom sketch artists present to capture the milieu.[284][r]\n\nThe temperature in the trial courtroom was a point of contention, with Trump repeatedly complaining that it was too cold, akin to an icebox, possibly intentionally.[289][290][291] Judge Juan Merchan acknowledged that the courtroom was chilly, but has stated that he would rather it be a little cold than too hot, and that climate control is limited in the 80-year-old building.[292][291] Despite Trump\'s complaints, reporters in the courtroom noted that the temperature was not as cold as he claims.[293]\n\nJury selection and opening statements\n\nOn April 8, 2024, the judge gave attorneys a copy of the jury selection questionnaire,[294] with jury selection beginning on April 15[295][296] from a pool of over 500 candidates.[297]\n\nOver the first two days, 96 potential jurors appeared, of which more than half were immediately dismissed after indicating that they could not be impartial. Nine jurors provisionally qualified on the first day, and an additional ten on the second;[298][299][300] from these 19, seven jurors were selected and sworn in.[s]\n\nHowever, two were excused on April 18, one of whom complaining that her friends and family had recognized her from details published in the news.[300][303][304] Trump was reprimanded by the judge on April 16 for gesturing and audibly speaking in the direction of a potential juror.[305][306]\n\nAnother group of 96 potential jurors was brought in later in the week.[304] Twelve jurors, along with one alternate, were selected by April 18.[307] The selection of six alternate jurors concluded on April 19.[308][309] The jury reportedly comprised seven men and five women, who mostly had white-collar careers.[310] The jurors were allowed to tell their family and employers that they were on the jury but could not discuss the case with them.[311]\n\nTrump was described as falling asleep for brief intervals on four out of the first five days of the trial, ahead of opening statements,[312][313][314][315][316] and as being flatulent.[t] Trump has denied dozing off at his trial.[u]\n\nOn April 22, opening statements began.[328] Prosecutors accused Trump, Cohen, and Pecker of campaign finance violations, alleging they coordinated payments to two women and concealed them as part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.[329] During their opening statements, prosecutors said the jury would be presented with a document with a handwritten note in the margin by Allen Weisselberg outlining the hush-money payment scheme.[330][331]\n\nThe defense argued that the testimony of Cohen, a convicted felon, could not be trusted; that the payments were ordinary business transactions, akin to editorial decisions made by newspapers;[332] and that in democracies it is normal for candidates to attempt to influence an election.[329]\n\nContempt hearings\n\nOn April 15, prosecutors asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for three alleged violations of the gag order against him;[307] prosecutors also requested to use the attacks on Cohen as evidence.[298][258][333] By the morning of April 18, prosecutors alleged that Trump incurred seven further violations of the order and requested that he be fined another $7,000.[307]\n\nOn April 23, Merchan heard arguments about whether Trump had violated the earlier gag order when he made social-media posts about two expected witnesses.[334] Merchan criticized Trump\'s attorney Todd Blanche for failing to justify Trump\'s claim that he was merely responding to ""political attacks"" and for failing to provide any legal precedent supporting Trump\'s claim that reposting an article could not be a violation of a gag order; Merchan told Blanche, ""You\'re losing credibility.""[334][335] Merchan rejected Trump\'s position that reposting a news article to social media was a merely ""passive"" rather than active act.[336][v] The defense also declared that ""Trump absolutely knows what the gag order allows him to do and does not allow him to do.""[336]\n\nOn April 30, Trump became the first U.S. president ever to be held in criminal contempt of court, under NY Judiciary Law Section 750(3).[337] (Trump had previously been held in civil contempt, for withholding documents, in the New York business fraud case.)[338] Trump was found in contempt on nine of the ten counts, regarding statements made from April 10–17.[339] Over the next few days, he paid a $9,000 fine.[340][341][342] Merchan said he would consider jailing Trump for further violations ""if necessary and appropriate"".[343]\n\nOn May 2, a second hearing was held to consider four further violation claims.[w] The prosecution said it was ""not yet seeking jail"".[348][349] On May 6, Trump was found in contempt for one of those four claims (when he on April 22 commented on the jury) and was fined $1,000.[x] The judge again warned Trump of possible incarceration for further violations.[352]\n\nThe mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, said that corrections officials would be ""ready"" if the judge ordered incarceration.[353]\n\nProsecution witnesses\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nProsecutors called former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker to testify on April 22, 23, 25 and 26 as the trial\'s first witness, taking most of the first week of testimony.[354] He had been given immunity in 2018 in a federal investigation into Michael Cohen in exchange for information regarding hush money deals.[355] During Pecker\'s testimony, it was implied that former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, who Pecker stated was now living in Australia and suffering from a ""spinal condition"", would not testify.[354][356] It was previously reported that while Pecker and his company American Media Inc. (AMI), the National Enquirer\'s parent company, facilitated payment to McDougal,[357] Pecker refused to personally do the same with Daniels,[358][359] though he allegedly alerted Trump associates about Daniels\' decision to go public with her affair allegation.[360] On April 23, Pecker testified that Cohen used to feed him negative stories about Trump\'s enemies, which Pecker\'s staff would then ""embellish"" and show drafts to Cohen to get his feedback before publishing them.[361] Pecker also detailed how he offered to deploy the ""catch and kill"" scheme, stating that he offered in 2015 to suppress negative stories about Trump and flag efforts by women attempting to sell stories about him.[362] The prosecution cited a state election law regarding conspiracy to defend their questioning of Pecker about his contacts with Steve Bannon, the chief executive officer of Trump\'s 2016 campaign.[363]\n\nOn April 25, Pecker testified that AMI suppressed negative press about other celebrities, which was emphasized by Trump\'s team in their cross-examination.[364] Additionally, he stated that he did not believe Cohen was working for Trump\'s campaign.[365] Pecker discussed his relationship with Trump prior to the 2016 campaign, during which he suppressed other negative stories about him. Pecker detailed how his company, Trump and Cohen facilitated payment to McDougal in mid-2016, in tandem with promising her a ghostwritten monthly column in an attempt to disguise the contract\'s true nature.[364][282][366] In September 2016, Cohen asked to purchase the boxes of McDougal\'s source material (valued by Pecker at $25,000) on Trump\'s behalf. Pecker then told Cohen that he did not want to be reimbursed for the payment to McDougal. According to Pecker, an AMI staff member leaked details of the scheme on November 4, 2016, ahead of the election, after which Pecker released a false statement that AMI had never paid anyone to kill damaging stories about Trump. AMI then amended its contract with McDougal allowing her to speak to the press.[366] Pecker also described a January 2017 meeting in Trump Tower in which Trump thanked Pecker for his work regarding McDougal and another story.[366][367][y] Pecker said his decision not to facilitate payment to Daniels (because she was a porn star) led to it being done by Cohen.[364] Pecker testified he acted at Trump\'s behest and intended to help him win the presidency, despite his own doubts regarding campaign-finance laws.[366][368] Additionally, Pecker said that after receiving a letter from the Federal Election Commission about possible campaign violations in mid-2021, he signed a non-prosecution deal with federal prosecutors for his cooperation.[366]\n\nGraff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson\n\nFour witnesses testified over the latter part of April 26 through the earlier part of April 30.\n\nOn April 26, Trump\'s executive assistant Rhona Graff testified that when she worked outside Trump\'s office in Trump Tower, she maintained contact information for McDougal and Daniels,[369] and that she had a ""vague recollection"" of glimpsing Daniels at a Trump Tower reception area.[370] During her cross-examination by the defense, Graff said Trump was sometimes prone to multitasking while signing checks, depending ""what was going on ... and how important the checks were"".[17][371]\n\nAdditional testimony was also provided by former First Republic banker Gary Farro on April 26 and 30. He testified that on October 26, 2016, he helped Cohen open an account for a real-estate limited liability company. According to prosecutors, the same day, Cohen deposited $131,000 from his personal home-equity credit line, and the next day transferred $130,000 to Daniels\' lawyer, Keith Davidson.[370][372][373] He detailed how he assisted in setting up the bank account which enabled Cohen to make the hush money payment. Farro stated that Cohen was eager to connect with him, and would set up the account in October 2016. Farro also noted that the account was set up for Essential Consultants LLC, the company the payment was made from, and that it was funded through Cohen\'s home-equity line of credit at First Republic.[373][374] According to Farro, Cohen did not want addresses on the checks.[373] Prosecution also presented evidence showing emails to and from Cohen, which confirmed the $131,000 deposit to a checking account 20 minutes after it was opened.[374] In texts between Davidson and Cohen, Davidson provided wiring instructions for the $130,000 hush-money payment. According to Farro, First Republic closed Cohen\'s accounts after the payment to Daniels became public.[375]\n\nApril 30 also saw testimony from C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Robert Browning, who verified the authenticity of C-SPAN videos of Trump, as well as Phillip Thompson, a regional director of Esquire Deposition Solutions, which provided court reporter services for Trump\'s October 2022 deposition in one of the E. Jean Carroll defamation cases.[376][377]\n\nOn May 20, the prosecution tried to contact Browning to see if he would be available to testify again, this time regarding a photograph of Trump with his former bodyguard Keith Schiller.[378][379]\n\nKeith Davidson and Douglas Daus\n\nSee also: Keith Davidson § Stormy Daniels\n\nKeith Davidson, a former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, appeared on April 30 and May 2. He testified that the Access Hollywood tape helped influence Daniels to go forward with her story.[380] According to Davidson\'s testimony, he drafted the $130,000 hush-money agreement, in which he used the pseudonyms ""Peggy Peterson"" for Daniels and ""David Dennison"" for Trump.[381] The agreement called for payment by October 14, 2016. When the payment did not arrive, Davidson communicated with Cohen,[382] who told him that Trump was traveling.[383] On October 17, Davidson wrote to Cohen that the agreement was void and furthermore that he would no longer be representing Daniels.[384] (Cohen would wire his personal funds to Davidson on October 27.)[385]\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Trump was behind the hush-money talks.[386] However, he also acknowledged how Cohen wired the transfer and that he also had conversations with Howard as well as Daniels\' manager Gina Rodriguez regarding the deal. Howard and Rodriguez, who had no direct roles, would encourage Davidson to connect with Cohen. Daniels, Davidson and Rodriguez were also revealed to have received part of the $130,000 settlement payment. Davidson\'s role in the $150,000 deal with AMI for McDougal\'s story was noted as well.[375]\n\nOn May 2, the jury heard an audio recording of Cohen and Trump from September 6, 2016 appearing to discuss paying Pecker for McDougal\'s story, wherein Cohen mentions talking to Weisselberg about setting up the payment and Trump asks, ""So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?""[387] Further audio was played of a phone call in which Cohen tells Davidson that ""I can\'t even tell you how many times [Trump] said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it,"" apparently regarding the payment to Daniels.[157] Davidson acknowledged texting Howard on Election Night 2016: ""What have we done?"", to which Howard responded ""Oh my god.""[158] Davidson explained that this was a recognition that ""our activities may have assisted the presidential campaign"" and that it was ""sort of gallows humor"".[388] He also confirmed that, after texting with Cohen on February 13, 2018, he sent a statement to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo to corroborate Cohen\'s claim of having paid $130,000 to Daniels from his personal funds.[389] Davidson testified during his cross-examination that he had never personally met Trump.[157]\n\nOn May 2, prosecutors called Douglas Daus, a computer forensics specialist in the district attorney\'s office. Daus testified to examinations of Cohen\'s cell phones. Several of the prosecutions proposed exhibits were found by Daus.[390]\n\nHope Hicks\n\nSee also: Hope Hicks § Career\n\nOn May 3, former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified. She said a Wall Street Journal reporter asked her for comment on the alleged Trump–McDougal affair, which is how she learned that AMI had paid to catch and kill the story.[391] She stated that she drafted a statement to respond to The Wall Street Journal, with Cohen offering feedback, but Trump overrode them by telling Hicks to say that McDougal\'s allegations were ""totally untrue"",[392][393] which is how she was quoted by the Journal just days before the election.[394][357] Hicks also learned at this time that the Journal planned to publish details of Daniels\' allegations, with Trump instructing Hicks to deny any affair.[395] Hicks stated that Trump sought to hide news of both scandals from Melania,[396][395] and after the story of the payment to Daniels broke in early 2018, Trump told her that Cohen had voluntarily decided to pay Daniels to protect him; Hicks opined that this seemed out of character for Cohen.[395] Trump sought Hicks\'s opinion about how the Daniels story was being perceived, especially in relation to the negative impact it may have had if Cohen had not paid Daniels before the election.[393][397] Hicks further testified that she had heard Trump praise Pecker on multiple occasions for his negative reporting on his Republican rivals in the 2016 election.[395]\n\nAccording to Hicks, the Access Hollywood tape roiled the Trump campaign.[395] Though Trump tried to minimize its significance,[398] the campaign felt the tape was a ""crisis"".[399] Hicks stated that the tape\'s release stressed Trump because he wanted members of his family, including Melania, to be proud of him and not hurt or embarrassed.[400] In her cross-examination by the defense, Hicks stated that Trump ""is a very good multitasker [who] is always doing many things at once"".[371]\n\nMcConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin\n\nThree witnesses appeared during May 6 and the earlier part of May 7.\n\nOn May 6, former Trump Organization comptroller Jeffrey McConney testified about how Cohen was reimbursed.[401] He testified that Weisselberg instructed him in early 2017 to send the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401][402][403] McConney acknowledged that he told organization payroll specialist (and its accounts payable supervisor) Deborah Tarasoff to record the reimbursement payments as ""legal expenses""; he said he told her these payments were part of a retainer agreement between Cohen and Trump.[401] McConney further stated that starting in March 2017, the reimbursement checks for Cohen came from Trump\'s personal bank account.[401] In 2017, Cohen quit working for Trump after setting up shop at Squire Patton Boggs\'s offices in Midtown, but nevertheless still identified himself as Trump\'s personal lawyer.[401] Numerous invoice messages from Cohen and related emails between McConney, Tarasoff and Weisselberg were shown in the courtroom.[401] Several general ledger documents associated with Trump and his trust were reviewed which showed that Trump made the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401]\n\nFollowing McConney\'s testimony, Deborah Tarasoff, a 24-year employee of the Trump Organization who works in accounting, took the stand to testify. She said the organization was paying for her attorney.[404][401] She described her job duties: ""I get approved bills, I enter them into the system, and I cut checks.""[405] Tarasoff stated that she had no decision-making authority and merely followed instructions, but also acknowledged that she would approve invoices if she got them, including the ones which were sent to Cohen.[402] Tarasoff testified that while either Trump or one of his two older sons could approve invoices of over $10,000 since 2015, only Trump could access his personal checking account.[402] Twelve reimbursement checks for $35,000 were signed by Trump, and Tarasoff testified that they were mailed to Cohen.[402] Trump, who used a Sharpie pen when writing checks, could write ""void"" if he disapproved of checks Tarasoff created for the company[402] (e.g. a $70,000 check to Cohen signed by Eric Trump and Wiesselberg in February 2017, which was voided by Trump).[402] She testified that Weisselberg ""had his hands in everything"".[403] During cross-examination, Tarasoff acknowledged that she not was present for conversations between Trump and Weisselberg about the payments.[402]\n\nOn May 7, 2024, Penguin Books executive Sally Franklin testified. Franklin, whose company published a few Trump books, read excerpts from Trump: How to Get Rich and Trump: Think Like a Billionaire, including Trump quotes, ""If you don\'t know every aspect of what you\'re doing, down to the paper clips, you\'re setting yourself up for some unwanted surprises,"" and, ""For many years, I\'ve said that if someone screws you, screw them back.""[406]\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nStormy Daniels testified for five hours on May 7,[407] and for the earlier part of May 9.[408] She said she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 2006 and detailed a sexual encounter with Trump in his hotel suite after he invited her to dinner.[407][409] Daniels stated that Trump did not use a condom and that during the encounter, ""I was staring up at the ceiling, wondering how I got there,"" despite not having used drugs or alcohol.[407][z] She said she felt like she blacked out during the encounter and was traumatized by the experience.[411][409] It was the only time they reputedly had sex.[412] Daniels said Trump offered to make her a contestant on The Apprentice; she stated that he continued alluding to the idea for a time in subsequent phone conversations, in which he referred to her as ""honey bunch"" and asked when they could meet again.[406][409] Daniels noted that she met with Trump on multiple occasions, with dozens of witnesses,[409] including a visit to Trump Tower and a final encounter with Trump in Los Angeles in 2007.[409]\n\nIn accepting the hush money, Daniels stated that she was not motivated by money (although this appeared to be contradicted by a text message between her and her manager Gina Rodriguez which suggested she was willing to accept the payment).[409] She stated that she had no part in the hush-money negotiations.[409] Daniels also laid out key information about the payment.[409] She maintained her previous allegation that someone threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot, stating that she did not report it because it would have been upsetting to Trump.[409] Daniels stated that any violation of the hush-money agreement would have cost her a million dollars.[409]\n\nDuring Daniels\' testimony, Merchan sustained many defense objections.[409] He repeatedly admonished Daniels for giving answers that went beyond the scope of the question asked, and at one point interrupting Daniels\' testimony, stopping her from describing the sexual position she and Trump used.[407][409] Merchan criticized the ""degree of detail"" on matters such as the floor size of the hotel suite.[406] In a sidebar conference, Merchan agreed with defense arguments that Daniels described things which were ""better left unsaid"" regarding the sexual encounter, but denied the defense\'s request for a mistrial, noting that the defense would have the opportunity to cross-examine Daniels.[407][409] Merchan set confines for Daniels\' later testimony and directed the prosecution to encourage her to give shorter answers.[409] Afterward, Daniels gave shorter answers and hewed closer to the question asked.[407]\n\nWhen testimony resumed, Daniels stated that her lawyer Keith Davidson received the $130,000 hush-money payment, and that she got $96,000 of it. She also acknowledged that she signed a statement dated January 10, 2018, in which she denied the affair, but testified that she did not want to sign it and that it was untrue.[409]\n\nIn its cross-examination, the defense questioned Daniels about her account of being traumatized by her encounter with Trump, suggesting that her pornographic career would have made the event unsurprising. Daniels explained that the first time she realized the meeting was intended to be sexual was upon coming out of the bathroom inside Trump\'s hotel, finding him stripped to his boxers; she elaborated that she was ""not expecting [this from] a man twice [her] age"".[411] Daniels acknowledged that she had contacted renowned high-profile sexual harassment attorney Gloria Allred about potentially suing Trump for the encounter. Much of the cross-examination focused on questioning the accuracy of her allegation that she was threatened in a Las Vegas parking lot, which was revealed to have been disputed by Davidson via texts with Cohen. Despite accepting the hush money, Daniels maintained that her primary goal was to ""get the story out"".[409]\n\nOn May 9, Daniels concluded her testimony after hours of cross-examination.[408] Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Daniels on how she profited from her story and brought up minor inconsistencies in how she has told it.[408] Merchan again denied a defense motion for a mistrial, but would provide the jury instructions instructions limiting the use of her testimony.[413][414] [aa] Trump criticized Merchan for permitting the testimony stating ""He’s [Merchan] trying to make it as salacious as possible by allowing testimony that has nothing to do with the case.""[418]\n\nManochio, Menzies, and Westerhout\n\nOn May 9, Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper at the Trump Organization, testified for about a half-hour. She had provided evidence to the prosecution.[419][420] Tracy Menzies, a senior vice president at HarperCollins, then testified about the accuracy of certain excerpts from the book Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life, which Trump had co-authored.[421]\n\nTrump\'s director of Oval Office Operations in 2019 and former Secretary to the President between 2017 and 2019, Madeleine Westerhout, also began testifying the same day.[408][414] She stated that Republican National Committee officials she was working with in 2016 discussed how to replace Trump as the Republican presidential nominee due to concern about the damaging Access Hollywood tape.[422] She also noted how she set up a meeting between Cohen and Trump in February 2017, and how the meeting led to Trump Organization employees sending reimbursement checks to the White House—which Trump would then sign and send to Cohen—through a circuitous mail system.[423] She was in tears when discussing how Trump fired her, reportedly in response to her telling reporters that she had a better relationship with him than his daughters.[424]\n\nWesterhout resumed testifying on May 10.[423] During cross-examination, Westerhout appeared to side with defense arguments that Trump used alternatives to the White House mail system because he wanted to get mail to people more quickly.[423]\n\nDixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider\n\nFor the later part of May 10, four other witnesses testified.[425] Among these witnesses were Jennie Tomalin (a Verizon senior analyst), Daniel Dixon (an AT&T compliance analyst), and Jaden Jarmel-Schneider (a paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office).[423] In successive testimonies, Dixon and Tomalin would authenticate cell phone records which were used as trial evidence.[423] Georgia Longstreet, another paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office, again testified after previously doing so days prior.[423] Longstreet also showed some of Trump\'s old tweets, as well as texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard.[423] Jarmel-Schneider then showed a chart which summarized 34 business records which prosecutors say were falsified.[423]\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nOn May 13, Michael Cohen, Trump\'s former ""fixer"" and attorney (who is considered the case\'s star witness), began testifying.[426] He would give 17 hours of testimony over four days.[427]\n\nOn May 13, Cohen acknowledged that he, Trump and David Pecker conspired to suppress negative stories and promote positive stories about Trump during the 2016 election.[426] He said his work in this matter ""was at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump"", stating that ""Everything required Mr. Trump\'s sign-off.""[428] By email (shown as evidence), Cohen informed the National Enquirer that Trump did not want them to report his affair with a ""Penthouse Pet"".[426] Cohen specified his role in the Enquirer\'s first catch-and-kill story for Trump, about a Trump Tower doorman who alleged that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.[426] Cohen detailed his role in the hush-money payment to McDougal, stating that he monitored progress by text, phone and the Signal app.[426] He repeated that he communicated by ""phone, email and text"" with McDougal, Daniels and Keith Davidson.[426][9] By text message, Cohen told Dylan Howard that he was making the payments on Trump\'s behalf.[426] He further noted that after Pecker refused to pay for the Daniels story, he took over as funder of ""catch-and-kill operations"".[426]\n\nCohen acknowledged Hicks\'s testimony about the conversation over the McDougal payment press coverage.[426] According to Cohen, he and everybody at the organization had contact with Weisselberg.[426] He further accused Weisselberg of providing him with the financial advice concerning the payment to McDougal, stating that it foreshadowed the way he arranged for the Daniels payment.[426] Cohen said he first spoke to Trump about the Daniels allegation in 2011 after it was leaked to The Dirty, and that Trump called her ""a beautiful woman"" (having said the same about McDougal) and said they had met in 2006 at a golf outing and that she had liked him more than football star ""Big Ben"". Cohen said Trump did not respond when he asked if he had had sex with her and that Trump took him up on his offer to get the story taken down.[9]\n\nCohen said the release of the Access Hollywood tape was viewed as a campaign liability and that Trump afterwards directed him to pay Daniels to avoid ""catastrophic"" damage.[426][9] Cohen said that he viewed supermarket tabloids like the National Enquirer to be influential in reaching voters[426] and that Trump was concerned about the effect Daniels\' story could have had on female voters.[426] Cohen stated that Trump told him: ""Just pay it. There\'s no reason to keep this thing out there. Just do it.""[429] Cohen testified that Weisselberg told him to not make the payment through the Trump Organization and instead to come up with a more creative way to do it.[426] Cohen said that he and Weisselberg discussed processing the $130,000 through one of Trump\'s golf courses as if it were a membership or event fee but they decided against it. When Weisselberg said he lacked the personal finances, Cohen agreed to pay it.[429] Cohen said he suggested the idea of including a clause in the nondisclosure agreement penalizing Daniels $1,000,000 every time she told her story.[426] After Trump\'s 2016 election victory, Weisselberg and Cohen discussed the reimbursement plan in Trump\'s 26th-floor office, and Weisselberg coordinated the repayments to Cohen.[426] A bank statement for Essential Consultants LLC from the end of October 2016 was presented, which showed the $130,000 sent to Keith Davidson and featured a note Cohen said was handwritten by Weisselberg. It showed the doubling of the $180,000 reimbursement—$130,000 for Daniels plus $50,000 for money Trump owed Cohen for paying tech company Red Finch (to poll for the Trump campaign and promote Cohen on Twitter as something of a sex symbol)—so that Cohen would receive the full amount after paying 50% in taxes, plus a $60,000 year-end bonus, totaling $420,000. Cohen said it occurred to him that Weisselberg and Trump had planned this reimbursement scheme in advance and that Weisselberg had said in Trump\'s presence that the monthly payments would function in the guise of a retainer agreement.[430][401]\n\nCohen testified that he aspired to be a personal lawyer to the president but that Trump, instead of granting him this role, significantly cut his 2016 bonus. Cohen said his relationship with Trump was falling apart at this time. He said his work for Trump boosted his personal career, including by securing more prominent clients.[426]\n\nOn May 14, Cohen said he sent the Trump Organization false invoices requesting money for ""services rendered"". He said that, in February 2017, he confronted Trump in the Oval Office over his lack of repayment.[431] He said he lied about Daniels to protect Trump (while also ""staying on Trump\'s message"" by lying about the Trump Tower Moscow project).[432] Cohen testified that, in January 2018, he pressured Davidson to have Daniels sign a false statement denying the affair and payment, which Daniels signed on January 30, and also offered her an appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity.[433][434] Cohen testified that Daniels also wanted an appearance on Fox News\' Hannity, which she did not go through with.[435][434] Cohen also testified that he decided to stop lying for Trump following a meeting he had with his family shortly before his 2018 guilty plea.[435] Before the day concluded, Cohen began defense cross-examination.[435] On May 16, a Trump lawyer accused Cohen of lying that on October 26, 2016, he was on the phone with Trump\'s personal bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and had him hand the phone to Trump, who then approved the hush-money deal. The defense cited phone records as showing that a series of prank calls to Cohen had prompted him to contact Schiller for a call lasting one minute and 36 seconds, which Cohen defended as enough time to handle both matters.[436]\n\nOn May 20, during cross-examination, Cohen confirmed that around October 26, 2016, he helped Tiffany Trump regarding an extortion issue she faced. He said he was also working with David Pecker that month.[437] Cohen made two brief calls to Donald Trump on the morning of October 26,[438] which he said were about Daniels.[439] On January 27, 2017, Cohen told the Trump Organization he would no longer be working at Trump Tower because he was now Trump\'s ""personal attorney"".[440] On January 31, 2017, Weisselberg emailed Cohen with the subject: ""Note and mortgage modification agreement for Trump Park Avenue Condominium."" Weisselberg asked Cohen to ""prepare the agreement discussed"" so Weisselberg could start sending monthly payments.[441] Cohen said that Donald Jr. and Eric Trump signed the checks ""because they were the trustees"".[442] In 2017, he received nine checks for $35,000 apiece directly from Trump, plus two checks from the trust.[443] Cohen confirmed that he lied to Weisselberg about how much he had paid Red Finch, and that his false reimbursement request amounted to theft from the organization.[444][445][446][447] He said he lied in 2018 when he said that Trump had been unaware of the Daniels payment.[448] He said he had no income between his 2018 guilty plea[449] and the publication of his 2020 memoir,[450] but that since then he had earned $4.4 million from podcasts and books.[451] Asked whether he has a ""financial interest in the outcome of this case"", Cohen said he expected to make more money if Trump was found not guilty, since ""it gives me more to talk about"".[452][453] He acknowledged that his name recognition comes from his frequent criticism of Trump and that he was even interested in running for Congress.[446]\n\nDefense cross-examination of Cohen concluded on May 20. Cohen testified that the retainer agreement Weisselberg proposed he maintain with Trump to conceal the monthly reimbursements was fraudulent in nature.[454][430]\n\nThe defense pointed to occasions when Cohen did legal work, and said this was evidence that he was retained as a lawyer under a valid retainer agreement, as Cohen would not do legal work for free, nor would Trump pay in excess of reimbursements. Additionally, the defense pointed out that CFO Weisselberg requested from Cohen an agreement without suggesting it would be a fake agreement: ""please prepare the agreement we discussed so we can pay you monthly.""[455][456][457]\n\nThe prosecution then conducted redirect examination. The prosecution rested its case the same day.[458][459][460]\n\nDefense witnesses\n\nThe defense began its case on May 20, 2024, and rested its case on May 21 after calling two witnesses.[427][461] Trump did not testify.[462][463][ab] On May 22, he stated (in a press interview outside the court proceedings) that he did not testify because (1) he disagreed with Merchan\'s past rulings, (2) he was concerned about being questioned about his own past, and (3) there was ""no case"".[464][471][ac]\n\nThe defense team had initially planned to call Bradley Smith, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as an expert witness on campaign finance law.[473] Smith had argued that the payments to Daniels were not campaign payments and not illegal.[474] However, on May 20, Judge Merchan ruled that Smith\'s testimony would be limited to ""general definitions and terms"" so as to not supplant the judge\'s role to determine what the law is.[475][476] Smith was prohibited from mentioning ""there had never been a case in which anyone had been convicted of a federal campaign finance law violation for the making of \'hush money payments\'"" and from discussing ""that the FEC dismissed the complaint against defendant and the DOJ decided against prosecuting defendant for potential FECA violations"" due to irrelevance.[477] In February 2024, prosecutors pointed out that Smith had previously been barred from testifying for the defense in two unrelated federal cases in Manhattan where the defense had improperly sought to have Smith interpret campaign finance law for the jury: United States v. Bankman-Fried and United States v. Suarez.[476] As a result, the defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.[478][479] Trump then falsely stated that Merchan had not allowed Smith to be called,[480] and Smith wrote that the ""judge\'s bias is very evident.""[481]\n\nDaniel Sitko\n\nOn May 20, Daniel Sitko, a paralegal for Todd Blanche, provided testimony.[482] A chart of phone calls between Cohen and Robert Costello, the lawyer that Giuliani suggested Cohen hire in 2018, was submitted into evidence.[483]\n\nRobert Costello\n\nOn May 20, Robert Costello also testified.[484] Merchan admonished the witness for making comments on the stand objecting to rulings, staring at the judge, and rolling his eyes.[485]\n\nOn May 21, Costello was cross-examined by the prosecution.[486] Emails from Costello to his law partner Jeff Citron and Cohen were shown. In a May 2018 email to Citron, Costello said it was a goal to get Cohen ""on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president"" and said he believed it was ""the clear and correct strategy"".[486][487] When asked if ""the email speaks for itself"" as he had asserted the day before, Costello said ""Sometimes."" He also wrote to Citron about Cohen, ""What should I say to this asshole? He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet."" (Cohen testified that Costello and Trump\'s campaign had attempted to pressure him to realign to their interests.)[486] In an email to Cohen, Costello wrote: ""You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these \'journalists\' are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed. If you really believe you are not being supported properly by your former boss, then you should make your opinion known.""[486] The defense rested its case thereafter.[486]\n\nClosing arguments and jury instructions\n\nLater on May 21, arguments over jury instruction language were held.[486] Merchan announced that the jury would be excused until the beginning of summations on May 28.[486][463] Merchan stated that the closing arguments ""will not be quick"" and that he expected his final instructions to the jury to last an hour.[486] On Memorial Day, May 27, Trump complained that the prosecution would get the last word as ""very unfair"", though this is standard procedure in criminal trials where the state has the burden of proof.[488][ad]\n\nOn May 28, the defense gave a three-hour closing argument including breaks.[492] Trump lawyer Todd Blanche claimed Trump had nothing to do with checks which were written by Trump\'s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.[493] Blanche questioned why prosecutors did not call Donald Jr. and Eric as witnesses despite their signing payment checks to Cohen.[493] Blanche also showed an email revealing that McConnery sought approval from both Donald Jr. and Eric.[493] Blanche alleged that it was Cohen\'s decision to make the hush-money payment and variously branded him a prolific liar.[493] Blanche sought to discredit Daniels\' ambitions, noting (among other things) text messages between her manager and publicist Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard which showed that Howard believed Pecker would pay for her story shortly after the Access Hollywood tape was released.[493] Merchan admonished Blanche for telling the jury: ""You cannot send someone to prison, you cannot convict somebody, based upon the words of Michael Cohen."" Merchan said this type of comment is ""highly inappropriate"" and ""not allowed"",[494] as the jury is instructed not to consider how Merchan might sentence Trump.[495][496][497]\n\nThe same day, the prosecution gave a four-hour and 41 minute closing argument including breaks.[493] Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass described Pecker\'s testimony as ""utterly damning"".[493] Steinglass noted that some key parts of Daniels\' story were proven true[493] and noted that the defense appeared to acknowledge that Trump knew about the Daniels payment as early as 2017.[493] Steinglass stated that it made sense that Cohen was interested in the outcome of the case, noting that Trump dropped him ""like a hot potato"" when their relationship soured.[498] Steinglass argued that Cohen was Trump\'s ""fixer"" and that his knowledge was ""limited to what actually happened"".[493] It was noted that Cohen did not work for the Trump Organization\'s legal department and answered directly to Trump.[493] A footnote from the 2018 Office of Government Ethics form was shown, which stated that ""In 2016 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump\'s attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.""[493]\n\nSteinglass went over phone conversations between Trump and Cohen regarding the hush-money payment and showed a December 2017 check to Cohen signed via Sharpie by Donald Trump,[493] arguing that the latter must have known the purpose of such checks, as his ""entire business philosophy was and is to be involved in everything"".[499] Steinglass cited a 2018 tweet by Trump in which he acknowledged that Cohen was reimbursed for an NDA via a retainer agreement, but said it had ""nothing to do with the campaign"".[499] Steinglass said the defense\'s characterization of the payments to Cohen was undermined by his lack of pay from Trump in 2018 despite Cohen doing legal work for him that year.[499] Steinglass further stated that the payment was made to ""hoodwink the American voter"".[493][500] At the end of closing arguments, Merchan said that jury instructions would be read on May 29 and were expected to last an hour.[493] Trump described the closing arguments as ""BORING!"" on Truth Social.[501][502][503]\n\nJury deliberations and verdict\n\nOn May 29, the jury began deliberations.[504] A few hours in, they asked to hear a readback of about 30 minutes of testimony by Pecker and Cohen; the readback was held the following day.[505] It regarded an August 2015 meeting between Pecker, Cohen, Trump, and Hicks, in which Pecker pledged to be Trump\'s ""eyes and ears"" regarding negative stories about him; additionally, the jury wanted to hear Pecker\'s testimony regarding an alleged phone call from Trump in which the two discussed a rumor that McDougal had gone to another outlet to publish her story.[506][507][508]\n\nOn May 30 at 5:07 pm EDT, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts,[1][509] making him the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony.[510] Merchan denied a defense motion for an acquittal.[511]\n\nPost-trial proceedings\n\nGag order\n\nOn May 31, 2024, the day after the trial ended, Trump told reporters he wanted to have the ""nasty gag order"" lifted.[512] On June 4, Blanche filed a motion to have the gag order lifted, stating: ""Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the government and the Court do not justify restrictions on the First Amendment rights of President Trump"".[513] On June 5, Matthew Colangelo asked that the gag order remain in place to ""to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.""[514][515] Many expected Trump, had the gag order been lifted, to assail trial participants including the witnesses, jury, and court staff, as well as their families.[516][517]\n\nOn June 18, the New York Court of Appeals said it would not hear an earlier appeal by Trump on the gag order, leaving it in place.[518]\n\nOn June 25, two days before the first 2024 United States presidential debates, Merchan partially lifted the gag order permitting Trump to comment on witnesses and jurors, but Trump cannot reveal the jurors\' identities, nor comment about court staffers, the prosecution team nor their families until after sentencing.[519][520][521]\n\nIn July 2024, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a lawsuit against New York State in an attempt to invoke the Supreme Court\'s exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes between two states.[522] The lawsuit sought to block Trump\'s gag order and sentencing until after the November election, accusing New York of interfering with the presidential election in Missouri and violating Missourians\' First Amendment rights.[522] On August 5, the Supreme Court ruled against intervening in the case.[523]\n\nDelayed sentencing hearing\n\nOn June 10, 2024, Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche attended his probation interview via videoconference.[524][ae] If placed on probation, Trump cannot associate with other convicted felons.[525][529]\n\nBefore his conviction, officials in state and federal agencies began preparing for possible incarceration.[530][531] Trump\'s rhetoric and lack of acknowledgement of any wrongdoing is expected to negatively impact the leniency of his sentence.[532] Trump\'s proponents have argued that any sentence restricting Trump\'s mobility or communication with voters could undermine confidence in the 2024 election.[533] Trump was the presumptive 2024 Republican Party nominee leading up to the 2024 Republican National Convention, and the party prepared for a prison nomination broadcast were he to be incarcerated before the start of the Republican National Convention on July 15.[534]\n\nTrump\'s sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for July 11.[535] However, Trump\'s counsel requested on July 1 to delay sentencing to consider the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States released that day.[222][536] The Manhattan DA\'s office agreed to the delay, though it said the Trump team\'s position lacked merit.[537] On July 2, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to September 18.[538] In August, Trump\'s team asked Merchan to again postpone the sentencing hearing until after the election,[539] and the Manhattan DA stated that it would defer to Merchan on this matter.[540] On September 6, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to November 26.[541][542]\n\nOn August 29, Trump\'s lawyers asked the federal court for the Southern District of New York to seize control of the case, complaining that a September sentencing date would amount to election interference.[543] On September 3, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request on the basis that the payments were an unofficial act.[544][545] Hours later, Trump\'s attorneys filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.[546] Although Merchan granted the sentencing delay, on October 14 Trump\'s counsel asked the Second Circuit to reconsider Hellerstein\'s rejection, arguing that it was based upon ""profoundly flawed analysis"" and continuing to assert that instead of being personally prosecuted, Trump was being politically persecuted.[545]\n\nOn November 12, the immunity hearing was delayed a week, to November 19, likely putting the sentencing date at risk as well.[547]\n\nImmunity ruling\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States, supporting presidential immunity for official acts committed by the seated president. Later that day, Trump\'s counsel requested permission to move to dismiss the conviction on the basis that some evidence presented in the trial constituted official actions by Trump.[222][536] This includes 2018 social media posts by Trump, phone records between Trump and Cohen, a government ethics disclosure referencing the hush money payment, and some of Hicks\' and Westerhout\'s testimony.[548][549][550]\n\nTrump\'s motion was formally made on July 11.[550] Merchan\'s ruling will center on whether the evidence presented constituted official actions, and whether it influenced the verdict.[548] If the conviction is overturned, prosecutors would need to convene another grand jury to issue a new indictment.[550]\n\nJudge Hellerstein had previously rejected defense arguments to this effect in July 2023 when Trump attempted to remove the case to federal court, saying that ""the matter was purely a personal item of the President.""[352]\n\nMerchan\'s ruling on immunity was initially expected by September 6. It was postponed so he could consider Trump\'s third recusal motion, which he denied on August 13.[551] The immunity ruling was expected by September 16.[552][553] On September 3, hours before Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request to remove his case to federal court, prosecutors urged Merchan to rule swiftly on the immunity question, expressing concern that Hellerstein might pause state court proceedings.[554] On September 6, Merchan postponed the immunity ruling to November 12.[541] On that day, Merchan agreed to a request from prosecutors to pause the case for a week while they considered how Trump\'s election could impact proceedings.[555][556]\n\nFirearms and liquor licenses\n\nTrump had turned over two of the three pistols he was licensed for to the New York Police Department (NYPD) on March 31, 2023, with a third pistol moved to Florida.[557] Trump\'s New York State concealed carry license was suspended on April 1, 2023, following his indictment on criminal charges.[558] New York state law and federal law prohibit people with felony convictions from possessing firearms, and federal law even prohibits people under indictment or information for a felony (but not convicted) from possessing firearms, a violation of which can result in up to 15 years imprisonment, or life imprisonment if one is subject to the enhanced penalties imposed by the Armed Career Criminal Act.[559] [560] As of June 5, 2024, Trump\'s New York firearm license is expected to be revoked after the NYPD\'s legal bureau completes its investigation.[561] At Trump\'s pre-sentence hearing on June 10, 2024, CNN reported that Trump was still in possession of the third firearm in Florida.[562][563]\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control declined to renew the liquor licenses for Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and Colts Neck, instead issuing temporary permits.[564] The alcohol laws of New Jersey prohibit a liquor license from being issued to ""any person who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude"", typically involving a serious crime involving ""dishonesty, fraud or depravity"".[564][565][566] Though the Trump Organization has stated that Trump is not connected with the liquor licenses, New Jersey attorney general pointed out that Trump is the sole beneficiary of his revocable trust, which owns the licenses.[564][567] A hearing for the licenses was expected to be held on July 19, but was delayed until after Trump\'s sentencing.[568][564]\n\nPotential appeal of conviction\n\nTrump has a right to one level of appeal for the conviction itself, which he is expected to use.[569][462] The appeal would be heard by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, which is the intermediate state appellate court covering Manhattan and the Bronx. If unsuccessful, the next step would be the New York Court of Appeals, the state\'s highest court, which has discretion whether to hear an appeal.[570]\n\nReactions\n\nSee also\n\nArrests of Ulysses S.

He testified against the company in a criminal trial last year and was sentenced to five months in jail. The company was convicted and fined $1.6 million.\n\nThe witness list also named Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen as among the 28 witnesses the attorney general’s office intends to call.\n\nIvanka Trump, a former top executive at Trump’s company, was originally a defendant, but a state appeals court found the claims against her were too old and dismissed them.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, who will preside over the jury-less bench trial in Manhattan next week, partly sided with the AG\'s office in a ruling Tuesday when he found that Trump had committed repeated acts of fraud for years. Trump attorney Christopher Kise has said he plans to appeal the ruling, which he characterized as ""outrageous.""\n\nTrump, meanwhile, blasted the judge he\'ll be testifying before as a ""Trump hating"" judge who has violated his civil rights.\n\nThe state Appellate Division — the same appeals court that dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump — had issued a temporary stay of the trial date of Monday after Trump complained that Engoron hadn’t ruled on some of his arguments. Engoron ruled on the issues Tuesday, and the appeals court allowed the case to proceed to trial Monday.\n\nJames has said Cohen, a former Trump loyalist, sparked her office’s investigation when he testified before Congress that Trump routinely exaggerated his assets in financial documents. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal charges of tax evasion, violating campaign finance laws and lying to banks and to Congress, and he was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nTrump has filed a $500 million lawsuit against Cohen in Florida alleging he breached his fiduciary duty to Trump by ""both revealing Plaintiff’s confidences, and spreading falsehoods about Plaintiff."" Lawyers for Cohen were scheduled to depose Trump in Florida next week, but his attorney Alejandro Brito argued in court Thursday that Trump needs to be in New York because of the AG\'s case.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres will hold another hearing Friday to determine whether to keep the date or push it back to Oct. 8 or Oct. 9. There is also a possibility the deposition could be held in New York at Trump’s request, but that would have to be approved by Cohen’s attorney.\n\nA source with knowledge of the situation said the deposition would still happen — it’s just a matter of when and where. Donald Trump’s attorney didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe civil fraud trial that begins next week in Manhattan could last until Dec. 22, the judge has said. In addition to the 28 main witnesses, the AG\'s office listed 25 more people as potential rebuttal witnesses.\n\nTrump\'s witness list, meanwhile, included 127 names of fact and expert witnesses, in addition to ""Any witness included on Plaintiff’s Witness List.""\n\nEngoron said in a ruling this month that he\'ll hear the case five days a week.

Eventually, the judge stropped trying to control Trump – he and the attorney general’s lawyer questioning Trump let him rant, and then mostly disregarded the missives.\n\nThe high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. Engoron has already ruled Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The New York attorney general’s office said they will rest their case after Ivanka Trump’s testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand:\n\nTrump’s campaign comes to the courtroom: The former president’s rhetoric at times during his testimony might as well have been at one of his rallies in front of supporters. He went after the attorney general. The judge. And the “political witch hunt” that he’s been railing against for years now. On the witness stand, the charged rhetoric was even more remarkable, as he attacked the judge sitting right next to him, with James in the courtroom watching his testimony just feet away. “The fraud is on the court, not on me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump gets an angry response from the judge: Judge Engoron tried at the outset of Trump’s testimony to stop the former president from making speeches and instead answer the questions, but it did little to change Trump’s approach. The judge responded by threatening to remove Trump from the witness stand, though that didn’t deter the former president either. “This is not a political rally,” Engoron said to Trump, telling Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise to “control your client.”\n\nTrump acknowledges changing valuation of Trump Tower triplex: The attorney general’s office pressed Trump on the properties central to his identity and brand: Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and other key parts of his real estate empire. The AG’s office attorney Kevin Wallace also pressed Trump on why valuations of properties were changed, such as his Trump Tower triplex, which was devalued on his financial statement in 2017 after a Forbes article found he had dramatically exaggerated the size of the apartment. Trump acknowledged there had on occasion been mistakes, such as the Trump Tower apartment valuation.\n\nTrump’s descriptions of his properties: The former president’s rhetorical flourishes went beyond attacking those who are investigating him. He also took the opportunity to play salesman and play up his properties. One of his chief complaints about the judge is a citation in his decision that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18 million, a number based on Florida tax appraisal records “It’s much more valuable,” Trump said of Mar-a-Lago, “and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes, that it’s biggest value is using it as a club.” Wallace took the answer to pin him down on that valuation. “You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” Wallace asked. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here.\n\nTrump finishes testimony in fraud trial; Ivanka Trump to testify Wednesday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has stepped down from the stand after nearly four hours of testimony in the civil fraud trial against him and his company.\n\nThe next witness will be his daughter Ivanka Trump on Wednesday, after which the attorney general’s office plans to rest its case.\n\nTrump’s attorney Chris Kise said he believes the trial should end in mid-December.\n\nTrump on whether he maintained accurate records from August 2014 onward: ""I hope so""\n\nWhen asked by the Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office whether he “maintained accurate books and records” from August 2014 going forward, Donald Trump said “I hope so.”\n\n“I hope so, I didn’t keep them myself. I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nTrump questioned about the value of Mar-a-Lago\n\nDonald Trump says he believes Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\n“You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” asked Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nThe valuation of Mar-a-Lago has been one of Trump’s complaints about the judge in the trial, after the judge cited a Florida tax appraisal of $18 million for the property in his decision finding Trump, his adult sons and his company committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nWallace asked Trump if he approved of valuing Mar-a-Lago as if it would be sold to an individual as a resident. “Did I approve it on this? I don’t know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump replied, “I don’t remember that, no” when asked if he explicitly told former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg or former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney to value the property that way.\n\nWallace confronted Trump with a 2002 deed of development rights that shows Trump deeded away his right to use the property as anything other than a social club.\n\nTrump then gave a long aside about Mar-a-Lago when Wallace asked him about not being able to use it as anything but a social club.\n\n“I don’t mind leaving it as a club. In fact, if somebody wanted it, smartest thing to do, have a club and have one member and that would be the member that lives in the club. But it’s much more valuable — and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes — that its biggest value is using it as a club,” Trump said.\n\nWallace showed Trump a 2003 article in which the former president told a reporter Mar-A-Lago will always be a club.\n\n“I think that was said with bravado more than legal intent,” Trump said on the stand.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nWhat the scene is like inside the courtroom as Trump takes the stand\n\nIt was an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump took the witness stand a bit ago in New York. The former president slowly climbed a couple of steps into the box and raised his hand to take the oath.\n\nFormer presidents are typically surrounded by a force-field of deference, due to their status and are accompanied everywhere by Secret Service agents.\n\nBut Trump, in a blue suit, shirt and blue tie rather than his typical campaign uniform of white shirt and red tie, is sitting in the witness box alone in a leather chair, with wood panels on either side. His hands are clasped in his lap, and a large bottle of water and two smaller ones are to his left beside a screen allowing him to see court documents.\n\nThis is a civil trial rather than a criminal one. And the American people can’t see it because it’s not televised. But this the moment when the reality of the 2024 campaign hit home. Trump is simultaneously a multiple defendant, as well as being the Republican front-runner and potential next US president.\n\nThis is the most extraordinary campaign in modern history in microcosm.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump arrives to court ahead of testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has arrived at a New York courthouse to face questions in the $250 million civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nJudge overseeing Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order on Friday\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order in the trial to extend to Trump’s attorneys after they raised multiple questions about the judge’s communications with his law clerk.\n\nIn a written order Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron prohibited Trump’s attorneys from making any further comments about confidential communications between the judge and his staff inside or outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe judge said violating the order would result in “serious sanctions.”\n\nAnalysis: Trump heads to the witness stand as the latest polls show him leaping past Biden in key swing states\n\nA year away from Election Day 2024, former President Donald Trump is set to testify in a civil fraud trial and separately faces more than 90 criminal charges, setting up the possibility that a convicted felon tops the Republican ticket next November.\n\nBut it’s President Joe Biden’s political prospects that are plunging.\n\nIn another extraordinary twist to a 2024 campaign season that is more notable for court hearings than treks through early voting states, Trump is expected to be called to the witness stand in New York on Monday. This is hardly typical activity during a post-presidency. But Trump was, after all, the most unconventional president.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is absorbing brutal new polls showing him losing to GOP front-runner Trump in multiple key swing states. The numbers will likely ignite panic among Democrats and renew doubts among Americans that the soon-to-be-81-year-old is up to a full second term. If the New York Times/Siena College survey is borne out in 2024, there would be no electoral path to victory for Biden. And an increasingly authoritarian Trump – who is promising a second term of “retribution” – could pull off a White House comeback in spite of sparking a Capitol insurrection with his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020.\n\n“I was concerned before these polls, and I’m concerned now,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“These presidential races over the last couple of terms have been very tight. No one is going to have a runaway election here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, concentration, resources. And so we have our work cut out for us.”\n\nThe coinciding crises facing both Trump and Biden belie the fact that, for all their deficiencies, neither is yet to face a serious challenger from within their parties as they seek the nomination.\n\nBiden’s position is weakening as he tackles cascading global threats such as the war in the Middle East, sheds support over his handling of the economy and sees cracks in the multiracial coalition that first elected him. It also reflects a nation that is divided and disconsolate, and groping for the elusive normality that the president promised three years ago after the pandemic and the historic turbulence of the Trump administration.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nHas a former president ever given testimony in his own civil trial?\n\nWhen Donald Trump takes the stand in his New York civil fraud trial Monday, it won’t be the first time a former president will have given testimony in his own defense in a lawsuit.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did it twice more than a hundred years ago, both when he sued a Michigan newspaper that accused him of being a drunk and later when he was sued by a fellow New York Republican whom Roosevelt had called a corrupt political boss.\n\nRoosevelt won both cases. Trump, by contrast, has already been found liable for fraud by the judge in New York.\n\nThose Roosevelt trials, separated by two years, were each sensational at the time, and they came after Roosevelt’s final campaign for the White House, when he placed second to Democrat Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after splitting with Republicans and running as a Progressive.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is very much still in the arena, and his legal strategy in a slew of civil and criminal cases is tied to his concurrent presidential campaign. He has argued that two gag orders – the one issued against him by a federal judge in Washington, DC, and the other by the civil trial judge in New York – hinder his ability to speak as a candidate.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-fraud-trial-live-updates-rcna122520', 'Headline': 'Trump fraud trial recap: Former president testifies in N.Y. legal case', 'Snippet': 'Trump stormed out of a New York City courtroom Oct. 25 after a heated day in court in which the former president was called to the witness stand in his $250 million state fraud case and fined ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump says his testimony \'went very well,\' calls case a \'scam\'\n\nand\n\nTrump told reporters this afternoon that he was pleased with his testimony, adding that he thought that the case is a ""scam"" that ""should never have been brought.""\n\n""I think it went very well,"" Trump said, referring to his testimony.

""The fraud was on behalf of the court. The court was the fraudster in this case.""\n\nThe former president went on to highlight a recent New York Times / Siena survey that showed him ahead of President Joe Biden in several battleground states. The poll numbers were also referred to in court today by Trump\'s attorney.\n\n""When you look at the numbers, the poll numbers that came out today ... people are sick and tired of what\'s happening,"" Trump said when he left the courtroom.\n\nJames says Trump \'engaged in distractions\' in court today\n\nLeaving the courtroom today, James characterized Trump\'s testimony as a series of ""distractions"" and ""insults.""\n\n""Today we heard from Donald Trump,"" James said. ""He rambled, he hurled insults. But we expected that.""\n\nJames said that the ""documentary evidence"" shows that Trump ""falsely inflated his assets to basically enrich himself and his family.""\n\n""The numbers don\'t lie. And Mr. Trump obviously can engage in all of these distractions and that what is what exactly what he did, what he committed on the stand today, engaging in distractions and engaging in name-calling,"" James said.\n\nJames said that she looks forward to hearing Ivanka Trump\'s testimony on Wednesday and then her team ""plans on closing our case"" after that.\n\nTrump is excused from the stand\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nTrump is now excused from the stand and finished giving testimony.\n\nThe prosecution finished its questioning, with Trump\'s team then deferring from a cross-examination.\n\nIvanka Trump is set to take the stand Wednesday.\n\nTrump rants about the case being a disgrace\n\nand\n\nTrump went on a rant, attacking Engoron and the trial and baselessly claiming that people are leaving New York because there are ""murderers on the streets.""\n\n""It\'s election interference,"" he said of the attorney general\'s case against him. ""We have a very hostile judge. I don’t have a jury. I wanted a jury.""\n\nThe mood in court has changed\n\nWhile the post-break mood in court is more relaxed, and Trump seems to be answering questions somewhat concisely, there have been some testy moments.\n\nAt one point, Trump cut the attorney general\'s lawyer off, telling him ""no"" and continuing to speak as the lawyer tried to ask a question.\n\nAt another point, when Trump continued to assert that his net worth was greater than what was on financial statements and thus the state didn\'t have a case, he again mentioned a disclaimer clause the company put on its financial statements, saying it ""goes on forever.""\n\n“That clause isn’t the only thing that goes on forever,” AG\'s office lawyer Kevin Wallace replied, apparently referring to Trump\'s previously discursive answers to his questions.\n\nTrump is calmer after the break\n\nTrump appears more measured and steady in answering the attorney general lawyer\'s questions — in sharp contrast to his testimony before lunch, when he was fired up.\n\nAG James mocks Trump\'s testimony\n\nand\n\nLetitia James, who\'s in attendance in court today, took to the social media platform X to deride one of Trump\'s claims about her on the witness stand.\n\nTrump testified that the value of his property at 40 Wall Street ""is hundreds of millions of dollars more than what she says. She doesn’t even know what 40 Wall Street is.""\n\nJames laughed at the remark in court, and then posted a message with a shushing emoji that said, ""Don’t tell, I can see it from my office window.""\n\nThe court has returned from the lunch break\n\nand\n\nThe court is back in session after a lunch break. The judge returned to the courtroom at about 2:15 p.m. ET.\n\nTrump is now back on the stand to resume his testimony.\n\nSketch: Trump on the stand\n\nA courtroom sketch artist\'s rendering of Trump testifying at his civil fraud trial today.\n\nTrump\'s lawyer calls Engoron \'unhinged\'\n\nAlina Habba, one of Trump\'s attorneys, told reporters during the lunch break that Engoron is ""unhinged"" and had ""predetermined"" that Trump was guilty.\n\n""I don\'t want to hear what he has to say,"" Habba said, quoting the judge\'s admonishment to Trump\'s lawyers this morning after Engoron asked Trump to give more succinct answers during his testimony.\n\n""That was what rang true loud and could not have been more honest, coming from the judge who was already predetermined that my client committed fraud before we even walked into this courtroom,"" Habba said.\n\nWhen he made the remark, Engoron had been trying to rein in Trump’s answers, telling his team that the former president was not there to talk about things outside the attorney general’s lawyer’s line of questioning.\n\nHabba went on to say that the country is ""falling apart"" and there is ""corruption in courtrooms where attorneys are gagged.""\n\n""You have a right to hire a lawyer who can stand up and say something when they see something wrong. But I was told to sit down today, I was yelled at,"" Habba said.\n\nHabba also criticized James, saying that she was using the trial to ""make a name for herself.""\n\n""[James] said this morning that the numbers don\'t lie and they won\'t lie in this case. Well, Miss James, I have a message for you: The numbers didn\'t lie when you ran for governor, and that\'s why you dropped out,"" Habba said.\n\nDuring the break, Trump also quoted Engoron\'s remark without context in a post on his social media site Truth Social.\n\nAt least one other former president has testified in court\n\nAt least one other former president has testified in court after having left office — Teddy Roosevelt did so twice.\n\nIn 1913, the 26th president was a plaintiff in a civil suit against a Michigan newspaper that had accused him of being a drunk. The second was a civil case in which Roosevelt was sued by a New York Republican Party boss he’d accused of being corrupt. Roosevelt won both cases.\n\nNBC News legal analyst Chuck Rosenberg breaks down Trump’s possible motives for sparring with Engoron while testifying in his civil fraud trial.\n\nThe court has left for a lunch break\n\nand\n\nThe court adjourned at about 12:50 p.m. ET for lunch. The proceedings are expected to resume again at 2:15 p.m. ET.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom with a team of aides and his lawyers, quickly passing reporters in the hallway again with no comment, but flashing a thumbs-up.\n\nJames also passed by reporters in the hallway but did not comment.\n\nTrump interrupts questioning to read from a document he pulled from his pocket\n\nMinutes ago, Trump pulled a paper out of his pocket, saying he wanted to read it. But the attorney general\'s lawyer pivoted to another question, and Trump rested the document to his right on the witness stand.\n\nTrump then interrupted the lawyer, saying he just wanted to read the document, and turned to the judge for an answer.\n\nEngoron told him no.\n\n“I am shocked,” Trump said.\n\nIt\'s unclear what the document is.\n\nTrump trains his ire on Engoron\n\nand\n\nLosing his composure, Trump then focused his ire on the judge, saying Engoron ruled against him before knowing anything about his company.\n\nTrump said the judge called him a ""fraud,"" raising his voice and pointing his right hand at the judge while looking straight ahead at the courtroom. He then said any fraud was on the part of the judge for his comments on the value of Trump\'s properties, not on Trump, calling it ""a terrible thing.""\n\nEngoron just looked forward, sour-faced.\n\n""Done?"" Wallace asked when Trump ended his outburst.\n\n“Done,” the former president said.\n\nTrump has essentially brought his rants inside the courtroom. Before, he would be well mannered during his appearances here; it was outside where he lost his cool. Now he\'s losing it on the witness stand.\n\nTrump defiantly asserts his wealth, calls James a \'hack\'\n\nand\n\nAs Trump was asked questions about additional properties, the former president said he is worth billions of dollars more than Attorney General Letitia James has said.\n\nPeople don\'t recognize the strength of the company he built because James\' office is trying to ""demean"" and ""hurt"" him, Trump claimed.\n\n“I think she is a political hack,” he said about the attorney general.\n\nHe repeated a common refrain of his online, calling the trial a political witch hunt and saying James should be ashamed of herself.\n\nWhile testifying in his New York civil fraud trial, Trump sparred with Engoron about his business dealings and claimed the trial was politically motivated. NBC News’ Vaughn Hillyard reports on what Trump said under oath so far.\n\nTrump appears restless during testimony\n\nand\n\nAs he testifies, Trump is leaning way back in his chair and has his arms crossed on his chest. He also appears a bit restless, slightly swaying his body back and forth.\n\nEarlier in the testimony, when Wallace would ask him to refer to pages of documents before him, Trump would only look at a screen provided in the courthouse, unlike a typical witness who would refer to the pages in his or her hands.\n\nTrump says he thought several valuations were \'too high\'\n\nand\n\nAs questioning continued about Trump\'s properties, the former president said he thought several valuations were ""too high,"" including of his Trump Tower triplex in 2014.\n\nAsked why the valuation was too high, Trump said a broker assessed the total area as 30,000 square feet, ""and I have access to the roof, and when you add the roof, you’re not that far off.” He said, ""I see how it was done,"" telling the court that ""they took 10,000 per floor"" and ""times three"" and didn’t take out the elevator shaft and other things.\n\nHe added, “There\'s a disclaimer clause, so if there is a mistake ... you don\'t get sued by the attorney general\'s office.”\n\nIn his earlier deposition, Trump referred to a disclaimer clause in the company\'s financial statements ""that says, don’t believe the statement, go out and do your own work. This statement is \'worthless.\' It means nothing.""\n\nBut in his late-September ruling ahead of the trial, Engoron shot down Trump’s claim. “The clause does not use the words ‘worthless’ or ‘useless’ or ‘ignore’ or any similar words,” Engoron wrote. “It does not say ‘the values herein are what I think the properties will be worth in ten or more years.’”\n\nEngoron cuts off Trump and prosecutor repeats questions\n\nand\n\nShortly after Trump resumed testimony, Engoron cut off the former president after Trump started to go on after answering a question about the value of an Avenue of the Americas property.\n\nAt another point, Trump veered into his focusing on China, Russia, and keeping the U.S. safe while president, the attorney general\'s lawyer said, “The question was actually about this property value.”\n\n""The question was"" and ""let me ask again"" are becoming familiar refrains as Trump doesn\'t answer the questions.\n\nTrump has returned to the courtroom\n\nand\n\nTrump walked back into the courtroom at about 11:14 a.m. ET.\n\nHe turned to reporters in the hallway and gave a silent thumbs-up before following his lawyers through the courtroom doors.\n\nThe judge also entered the courtroom and everyone stood.\n\nWhen he resumed testimony, Trump began answering questions more succinctly.\n\nTrump leaves for a break without addressing reporters\n\nTrump exited the courtroom for a 15-minute break, walking quickly past reporters in the hallway.\n\nWhen asked, ""How\'s it going in there?"" Trump gestured as if zipping his lips and continued to walk away with his lawyers.\n\nBreak called; Trump leaves stand\n\nThe court is taking a break. Trump has left the witness stand.\n\nJudge tells Trump lawyers: \'I beseech you to control him\'\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nThe judge is again asking Trump\'s lawyers to have him answer questions directly while on the stand.\n\n""That was a simple yes-no answer,"" the judge said. ""I beseech you to control him.""\n\nThe judge went back and forth with Kise, with the judge saying, ""I don\'t want to hear everything he has to say.""\n\nHabba then told the judge that Wallace needs to ask better questions, saying, ""More succinct questions will give more succinct answers.""\n\n""We are not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron responded. ""We are here to have him answer questions.""\n\n""It\'s not that simple,"" Habba replied.\n\n""I am not here to hear what he has to say, now sit down!"" Engoron then said, raising his voice.\n\nThe testy exchange prompted Trump to comment, ""This is a very unfair trial. I hope the public is watching.""\n\nThe judge\'s warnings are critical, as the case here is only meant to determine monetary damages. If Engoron determines that all of Trump\'s testimony is not credible, as he did the last time Trump took the stand, he may impose significant financial damages on Trump and his company.\n\nAttorney in hush money case audibly laughs\n\nand\n\nAs Trump continued to testify, one of his attorneys in the separate hush money case being brought by the Manhattan district attorney could be heard laughing in the second row of the courtroom as she observed and took notes.\n\nTrump says he thought Mar-a-Lago\'s value was underestimated\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nWhen asked about Mar-a-Lago, Trump said he thought its value was underestimated, but added that he didn\'t do anything about it.\n\nTrump referred to the attorney general\'s estimation that the Florida property was worth far less than he claimed (the AG’s office had noted the Palm Beach County assessor appraised its market value to be $18 million to $28 million from 2011 to 2021, while Trump’s balance sheet put its value at $426 million to $612 million).\n\nTrump claimed on the stand that the property was 50 to 100 times the state\'s estimation. He said he doesn\'t know how the lower estimation was arrived at, calling it ""absolutely crazy.""\n\nTrump says he thought his apartment was \'overvalued\'\n\nand\n\nTrump testified that he thought his Manhattan apartment ""was overvalued when I looked at it.""\n\n""But you never know because people come along and could say it\'s worth $250 million. It only takes one person to buy it,"" he said. ""I thought it was high and it is the brand value.""\n\n""The brand value is a very big part of the asset value of the company,"" he added. ""I could have added brand value and increased the value, and my financial statement would be very substantial.""\n\nEngoron asks Trump lawyers to control him\n\nJudge Engoron asked Trump\'s attorneys if they could control him in the courtroom. He said, ""This is not a political rally … maybe you need to have a talk with him right now.""\n\nKise calls Trump the \'future\' U.S. president, citing New York Times/Siena poll\n\nand\n\nDuring questioning, Trump attorney Chris Kise referred to his client as the future president of the United States, citing a poll released yesterday by The New York Times.\n\nThe survey, conducted in conjunction with Siena College, found that Trump is leading Biden in five out of six battleground states.\n\nTrump distances himself from his financial statements\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nAsked about the exaggerated financial statements at the heart of the case, Trump said that he knew little about them, and that banks didn\'t care about them.\n\n“All I did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary to supply the accountants for the statements,"" he said. ""I authorized whatever they needed to do to get their statement done.”\n\nAs for the bankers that the AG maintains were duped into giving him more favorable loans than he was entitled to, Trump said, ""They paid little attention to documents. They were more interested in the deal.”\n\nTrump says judge will rule against him\n\nand\n\n“What did you do to meet your responsibility of preparation of the financial statement,” James’ office asked.\n\nTrump said: “Me personally? First of all this was so long ago this is past statute of limitations.”\n\nTrump then insisted that Engoron will “rule against me because he will always rule against me.”\n\nEngoron pushed back, saying that Trump’s claim isn’t true, and asked him to please answer the question again: “You can attack me all you want, but just answer the question.”\n\nJudge tells Trump to be more \'responsive\'\n\nAt one point as Trump started to testify, Engoron asked him to ""please move it along and answer the questions.""\n\n""Some of the questions haven\'t been responsive,"" the judge added.\n\nTrump looked ahead as the judge said this, never turning toward him.\n\nTrump claims bankers didn’t pay attention to the financial statements\n\nand\n\nTrump said his team will bring in bankers who ""paid little attention"" to financial documents.\n\n“This crazy trial goes along. We will bring in bankers. They will explain what the process is,"" he said. ""They paid little attention to documents. They were more interested in the deal.”\n\nTrump rails against AG and prosecutors, calling them \'all haters\'\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nKevin Wallace, a lawyer for the AG\'s office, asked Trump about the appointment and acceptance of trustees, and in response, he said, ""You and every other Democrat … coming after me from 15 different sides … all haters.""\n\nHe was referring to the New York attorney general and U.S. attorneys.\n\nTrump has been sworn in\n\nTrump has been sworn in inside the courtroom, kicking off his testimony.\n\nTrump has taken the stand\n\nThe former president is now in the witness stand, where he will be questioned by prosecutors.\n\nTrump and Engoron enter courtroom\n\nand\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom and is seated at the defense table with his hands clasped together.\n\nHe\'s been chatting with his lawyers, Chris Kise and Alina Habba.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron has entered the courtroom.\n\nIt will be a tale of two Donalds on Monday: The one inside court, who has generally maintained his composure aside from a few facial expressions and a waving of the arms, and the one outside, who goes off on Engoron and his law clerk and a legal system that he claims is arrayed against him and his family.\n\nJames arrives at courthouse, says numbers \'don\'t lie\'\n\nJames arrived at the courthouse and told reporters outside that the facts and the numbers don\'t lie.\n\n""Trump has repeatedly and consistently misrepresented the value of his assets,"" she said. ""I’m certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting and call this a witch hunt. But at the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friends, don’t lie.""\n\nOnce inside, James greeted the prosecutors in a show of support, shaking hands with the visitors sitting in the front row.\n\nWhat to expect from Trump\'s testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is set to take the witness stand in a New York courtroom Monday, testifying in a high-stakes civil case that could lead to the dismantling of his sprawling business empire.\n\nHe was deposed in April after James filed her bombshell suit alleging that he and his company inflated their assets to the tune of billions of dollars to get more favorable rates from banks and insurers, and his answers there are likely to be a guidepost about how he’ll be questioned Monday.\n\nTrump spent about seven hours in the deposition answering questions from the attorney general’s office and disavowing responsibility for the annual statements of financial condition, which say “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.”\n\nIn his deposition, Trump testified that he considered the financial statements as being “worthless” and not “important” because they contained a clause that said, “the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon the disposition of the assets or payment of the related liabilities.”\n\nIn his deposition, Trump referred to that as a “clause in there that says, don’t believe the statement, go and do your own work. The statement is worthless. It means nothing.”\n\nIn his Oct. 2 ruling, Engoron shot down Trump’s claim. “The clause does not use the words ‘worthless’ or ‘useless’ or ‘ignore’ or any similar words,” Engoron wrote. “It does not say ‘the values herein are what I think the properties will be worth in ten or more years.’”\n\nRead the full story here\n\nThe courtroom is at full capacity ahead of Trump\'s testimony\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nThe courtroom has reached full capacity in anticipation of Trump\'s testimony today.\n\nThe line to get into the courtroom is still long and the number of photographers in the hallway is the highest it has been since the beginning of the trial. Some friends of the judge and his clerk are seated in the front row excited to witness history.\n\nEngoron has expanded a gag order to include members of the former president\'s legal team. The order was issued after the judge claimed they made “inappropriate remarks” about his law clerk.\n\nAnti-Trump protesters are outside the courthouse\n\nand\n\nA group of anti-Trump protesters gathered outside the courthouse this morning, holding a banner that reads, ""Invoke the 14th.""\n\nThe protesters advocating for invoking the 14th Amendment against Trump to block him from the ballot in his 2024 presidential run briefly stopped traffic along Centre Street.

""A dark day for our Country. WITCH HUNT!”\n\nTrump testified in the trial briefly — and then stormed out of court\n\nTrump stormed out of a New York City courtroom Oct. 25 after a heated day in court in which the former president was called to the witness stand in his $250 million state fraud case and fined $10,000 for violating a gag order.\n\nTrump’s abrupt departure appeared to surprise even his own lawyers and his Secret Service agents, who went scurrying after him. He returned to the courtroom in Manhattan after the court day ended and after Cohen finished his contentious testimony.\n\nEngoron handed down the financial penalty after having called Trump to testify under oath in the afternoon about whom he was talking about when he told reporters earlier in the day that the person sitting next to the judge was “very partisan.”\n\nTrump said he was referring to Cohen, whom he has called a rat, a liar and a felon. Engoron said he found Trump’s brief testimony “not credible.” He fined Trump for violating the gag order he issued this month after Trump had smeared his law clerk on social media.\n\nA red-faced and angry-looking Trump stormed out of the courtroom about 45 minutes later after Engoron denied a motion from his lawyers on a separate legal issue.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nHighlights from Eric Trump and Don Jr.\'s testimony last week\n\nDuring his testimony last week, Eric largely asserted that he lacked knowledge of the details of Trump Organization property appraisals and financial statements. The former president’s second-oldest son described himself as a “construction guy,” saying, “I pour concrete. I operate properties. I don’t focus on appraisals.”\n\nAt one point, however, he did acknowledge an awareness of his father’s financial statements dating as far back as 2013.\n\nTrump\'s eldest son, Don Jr., the first of the two to take the stand, said during his testimony that he didn’t recall the details of several documents shown to him in court. He added that he relied on the Trump Organization’s accountants and accounting firm, Mazars USA.\n\nTrump attorney Chris Kise, meanwhile, continued Friday to complain about the judge, pointing to stories in right-wing news outlets alleging Engoron and his clerk have made political donations to Democrats. Kise pointed to a story that alleged the clerk made donations in excess of legal limits for court staff in violation of court rules, and that the judge was notified and did nothing about it, which Kise said could be grounds for a mistrial if true.\n\nEngoron called the allegations untrue, adding, ""It\'s a shame we have descended to this level.""'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-us-canada-66978988', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump in New York court for $250m civil fraud trial - live ... - BBC', 'Snippet': 'Summary.

During the day he also called for Judge Arthur Engoron to be disbarred.\n\nThe morning session was a back and forward between sides, with the judge occasionally needing to interject to set things straight.\n\nIt\'s shaping up to be a fiery trial.\n\nIf you want more information about the fraud case, you can watch the video at the top of this post.\n\nAnd this article highlights five things you need to know about the court case.\n\nOur court reporters today have been Nada Tawfik and Madeline Halpert.\n\nAnd our writers were Brandon Drenon, Victoria Lindrea and Mike Wendling.\n\nThanks for joining us.\n\nTrump leaves court and once again gripes about having no jury\n\nDonald Trump seemed in a better mood at the conclusion of the day compared to his earlier statements.\n\nBut he did once again bring up his frustrations at not having a jury in this trial, which he called ""unusual"".\n\nThe judge had earlier told the court that there was no jury because the lawyers did not request a jury trial.\n\nTrump was also non-committal on if he would be back at court tomorrow, saying he might return but would rather be campaigning.\n\nWho is Alina Habba?\n\nDonald Bender is still giving testimony about being an accountant for Trump, but let\'s take a moment to talk about Alina Habba - a New Jersey-based lawyer who the New York Post labelled a ""firebrand"".\n\nHabba is the most Googled name of people involved in this trial (outside of Donald Trump, of course).\n\nHabba has become one of Trump\'s most trusted attorneys since she was hired in 2021.\n\nEarlier in her career, Habba worked as an executive at the renowned New York fashion designer Marc Jacobs. The 39-year-old mother-of-three was a relatively unknown civil litigation lawyer before working for Trump.\n\nSpeaking outside of a Miami courthouse in Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, she fiercely defended the former president.\n\n“The decision to pursue charges against President Trump while turning a blind eye to others is emblematic of the corruption that we have here,” Habba said.\n\nCurrently, Habba holds the managing partner position at Habba Madaio & Associates LLP, located near Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nWhat did Trump post online during the break?\n\nMike Wendling\n\nUS disinformation reporter\n\nWhen the court took a break, Trump took to his Truth Social network to once again rail against the judge and legal system.\n\nHe posted: “The highly political, Trump Hating Judge just stated that expert testimony is not evidence. Well, that means that every trial in American history has to be thrown out and started all over again!”\n\nTrump appears to be referring not to an actual ruling about the admissibility of expert testimony, but to a back-and-forth between the judge and his lawyer this morning about the weight to be given to a valuation by a specific expert.\n\nRemember, it’s the value of Trump’s properties that are key to this trial.\n\nTrump seems to be exaggerating for effect – it\'s hard to believe he really thinks the judge could invalidate the entire US legal system – but surely the former president and his lawyers will continue to disagree with the judge, both inside the court and online.\n\nMichael Cohen, the Trump supporter turned critic\n\nEarlier, the name Michael Cohen was brought up in court.\n\nSo who is he? Cohen is Donald Trump\'s former personal attorney, once known as his ""fixer"".\n\nCohen worked for Trump for more than a decade at the Trump Organization, as well as on the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and at the Republican National Committee.\n\nHe was sentenced to federal prison in December 2018 after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations and related crimes that happened while he was working for the ex-president.\n\nCohen then testified to a grand jury - transforming himself from Trump supporter to Trump critic.\n\nHe revealed details about alleged hush money payments he made to a porn star under Trump\'s instruction. His testimony led to Trump\'s eventual indictment on similar charges.\n\nIn a recent interview with MSNBC, Cohen said this New York civil fraud trial could be a “financial catastrophe” and a “deathblow to Donald”.\n\n“I can tell you this has always been his biggest fear. That he would lose all of his money and he would no longer be considered the mega-billionaire,” Cohen said.\n\nTrump hits out at judge before heading back into court\n\nThe former president just spoke to media for a brief moment outside the courtroom.\n\n""This judge should be disbarred. He shouldn\'t be allowed to be a judge,"" Trump says.\n\nIt\'s one of the same lines of attack he used in his statement this morning before court started.\n\nTrump has also been posting on his Truth Social media account in the past hour, saying once again that this is a ""witch hunt"".\n\nMar-a-Lago worth \'at least a billion\', Trump\'s lawyer says\n\nWhile court takes a break, let\'s look back at some more of what Trump\'s lawyer Alina Habba had to say.\n\nHabba was critical of the real estate valuations given to Trump\'s 17-acre Mar-a-Lago estate on the Florida coast.\n\nLast week, Judge Engoron ruled that the estate was over-valued by as much as 2,300% in one financial statement. He said the estate was likely valued between $18m and $27.6m.\n\nBut Habba says the value is whatever someone is willing to pay.\n\nShe says Mar-a-Lago would sell for ""at least a billion"".\n\nHubba said Trump\'s Doral golf course would also sell for at least a billion dollars.\n\nShe calls them ""Mona Lisa properties"" and says it\'s not fraud, it\'s just how real estate works.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/66989373', 'Headline': ""Fact-checking Trump's claims about New York fraud trial - BBC"", 'Snippet': 'Trump walks out of the New York courtroom during a break in the first day of the trial on whether he committed fraud. Donald Trump made a passionate opening statement, of sorts, on the first day ...', 'Full_text': 'Donald Trump made a passionate opening statement, of sorts, on the first day of his fraud trial in New York.\n\nThe former president was not giving evidence - instead, he stopped just outside the courtroom to address reporters before the historic hearing began.\n\nAfter a few stern looks at the camera, he launched into a lengthy preview of what his lawyers are expected to argue during the civil case again him, his two adult sons and the Trump Organization.\n\nHe also lobbed accusations against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the fraud charges and is seeking a fine of $250m (£207m), and Judge Arthur Engoron who already ruled last week that Mr Trump and his business had committed fraud.\n\nLet\'s take a closer look at seven of Mr Trump\'s claims.\n\n1. There were no victims\n\nThis is very important to Mr Trump. He believes there should be no case because ""there was no crime"".\n\n""No bank was affected. No bank was hurt,"" he said moments before the start of the trial, noting that all his loans were paid back on time.\n\nUnder this New York statute, however, the attorney general did not have to show that there were victims, only that Mr Trump committed ongoing fraud.\n\n2. The case was timed to damage Trump\'s 2024 campaign\n\n""This trial was railroaded and fast-tracked,"" the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination said. ""This trial could have been brought years ago, but they waited until I was right in the middle of my campaign.""\n\nMr Trump has cast this trial, as well as other lawsuits and indictments, as an attempt to hurt his bid to return to the White House next year.\n\nBut the investigation into these fraud claims began four and a half years ago, when Trump was still president, after his former fixer Michael Cohen went public with the Trump Organization\'s accounting practices.\n\nJudge Engoron reminded Mr Trump\'s lawyer on Monday that the judge has already dismissed claims the lawsuit was politically motivated.\n\n3. Trump was denied a jury\n\nAfter the judge\'s ruling last week, Mr Trump made this claim in a social media post, suggesting to supporters that he had been denied a trial and a jury, and therefore robbed of justice.\n\nOn Monday in court, the judge made a point to say that ""nobody asked"" for a jury trial.\n\nBench trials are not unheard of, and it means the judge alone will decide liability and penalties in the remaining six claims.\n\n4. The \'corrupt\' justice department is behind this\n\nTo fit the case into his wider ""witch hunt"" rhetoric, Mr Trump claimed that Ms James was corrupt, and that she was coordinating with and taking orders from the US Department of Justice.\n\n""It\'s all run by DOJ, which is corrupt, in Washington - everything goes through them,"" he alleged.\n\nHe has shown no evidence of coordination. Also, this is a civil fraud case based on New York state laws, not a federal one. The Justice Department has no jurisdiction here.\n\n5. The \'buyer beware clause\' renders contracts useless\n\nMr Trump pushed this rather unorthodox argument while speaking to reporters on Monday. His businesses\' financial statements have a clause that Mr Trump calls a ""buyer beware"" warning, a disclaimer he said means ""do not believe anything"".\n\nMr Trump says that putting a ""full disclaimer"" in financial statements, ""immediately takes you out of any fraud situation and any litigation"".\n\nBut the judge was clear in his ruling last week that these are non-party disclaimers from his former accounting firm Mazars, and that they do not insulate him from liability.\n\nThose disclaimers also plainly state that ""Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement…""\n\n6. The judge undervalued Trump properties\n\nIn an unusual step, the judge has already ruled that Trump properties were worth less than the former president and his company stated. That was part of a summary judgement delivered last week.\n\n""What he did - undervaluing these properties - is a disgrace to our nation,"" Mr Trump said on Monday.\n\nHowever, it was not Judge Engoron who came up with the valuations. The ones he cited in his ruling were from official assessors.\n\nTake Mar-a-Lago, for example, the former president\'s Florida resort. It was the Palm Beach County assessor - not the judge - that appraised the market value of Trump\'s primary residence at between $18m-$27.6m (£14.5m-£22.5m).\n\nMr Trump continues to claim it is probably worth 50 to 100 times more.\n\n7. Trump did not include his brand in his valuations\n\nMr Trump is not usually shy about telling the world how much his brand is worth.\n\nIn his comments before the trial, however, Mr Trump insisted it had not been factored into the valuations of various properties that are at the heart of this fraud case.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/legal/trumps-million-dollar-expert-lost-all-credibility-judge-ny-civil-fraud-trial-2023-12-18/', 'Headline': ""Trump's million-dollar expert 'lost all credibility,' judge in civil ..."", 'Snippet': 'An expert witness paid nearly $1 million by Donald Trump to testify at his New York civil fraud trial ""lost all credibility"" by ""doggedly"" justifying the former U.S. president\'s business records ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-fraud-trial-new-york-10-02-23/index.html', 'Headline': 'October 2, 2023 - Trump civil fraud trial in New York begins', 'Snippet': 'The New York attorney general’s first witness, Trump’s long-time accountant Donald Bender, testified about financial documents from 2011, including discrepancies in the price of Ivanka Trump ...', 'Full_text': 'Here are some of the key takeaways from the first day of Trump\'s civil fraud trial in New York\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was in attendance at a Manhattan courtroom for the opening day of the New York civil case against him and his namesake company.\n\nEven though he didn’t have to appear, Trump’s presence turned the courthouse into an extension of the campaign trail, where he has railed against the four criminal indictments against him, and now, a civil case where Judge Arthur Engoron ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud.\n\nInside the courtroom, Trump’s attorneys also sparred with the judge as opening statements began, a sign that they’re likely to take a combative approach with a trial that the judge expects to last into December.\n\nHere’s what to know from the first day of Trump’s trial:\n\nTrump labels it a “witch hunt”: In front of the cameras and on his social media site, Trump attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James for bringing the case against him. He attacked the judge for the ruling last week. And he sought to tie them to special counsel Jack Smith’s criminal indictments, even though they are unconnected.\n\n“This has to do with election interference, plain and simple,” Trump said before walking into the courtroom. “They’re trying to damage me, so I don’t do as well as I’m doing in the election.”\n\nAttorney general asks to ban Trump from doing business in New York: Kevin Wallace, with the attorney general’s office, alleged that Trump and his co-defendants conspired to commit persistent and repeated fraud and that Trump’s financial statements convinced banks to take on hidden risk “to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.”\n\nThe opening statement underscored the risk the case poses to Trump and the Trump Organization, the former president’s business in New York, where Trump built up his name and image before he launched the political campaign that led him to the White House in 2016.\n\nTrump’s lawyers say this is how real estate works: With the former president looking on, Trump’s lawyers argued Monday that the attorney general’s case was flawed, saying that the differences in valuations were just part of the commercial real estate business.\n\nTrump’s attorney, Christopher Kise, argued there was no intent to defraud and “no victims” in the case.\n\nKise pointed to documents from Deutsche Bank showing the bank valued Trump’s net worth $2 billion less than Trump did — but still underwrote the loan for Trump.\n\nJudge spars with Trump attorneys: The judge noted that the defense team already had tried to dismiss the case by claiming James brought it as a “witch hunt” against Trump. He had already denied the motion, Engoron said, and his ruling had been affirmed by a New York appellate court.\n\nThe judge also sparred with Trump attorney Alina Habba over a discussion about an accounting disclaimer for Mazars, Trump’s former accounting firm. The disclaimer essentially said, “We’re relying on the Trump Organization,” Engoron said. “That’s how I read it.”\n\n“No, your honor,” Habba responded, arguing that the Trump Organization relied on Mazars and “they’re the accountants.”\n\nThe exchanges underscored how the upcoming trial is going to be contested — especially when the judge, and not a jury, will decide the outcome.\n\nRead more takeaways here\n\nFact check: Trump’s inaccurate comments about a ""worthless clause""\n\nIn comments to reporters before the Monday hearing, Trump spoke at length about what he called a “worthless clause” disclaimer in the financial statements that are at issue in the trial.\n\nTrump said, “We have a clause in the contract, it’s like a buyer beware clause. It says, ‘When you take a look at the financial statement, don’t believe anything you read’ — this is up front. ‘Don’t believe anything you read.’ Some people call it a ‘worthless clause,’ because it makes the statement, and anything you read in the statement, worthless. It says, ‘Go out and do your own research, go out and do your own due diligence, you have to study the statement carefully. Do not believe anything.’”\n\nHe said moments later that the clause “immediately takes you out of any fraud situation and any litigation.”\n\nFacts First: Trump inaccurately described this clause, as Judge Arthur Engoron noted in a ruling last week in which he found Trump liable for fraud. The clause does not say “don’t believe anything you read,” its actual language is significantly softer than Trump claimed. And there is no apparent basis for Trump’s suggestion that the clause inoculates him against any litigation at all.\n\nEngoron wrote last week that “the ‘worthless clause’ does not say what defendants say it says, does not rise to the level of an enforceable disclaimer, and cannot be used to insulate fraud as to facts peculiarly within defendants’ knowledge, even vis-à-vis sophisticated recipients.”\n\nHe also wrote that “a defendant may not rely on a disclaimer for misrepresentation of facts peculiarly within the defendant’s knowledge” — and that “defendants’ reliance on these ‘worthless’ disclaimers is worthless.”\n\nHere’s the text of the clause:\n\nThere is certainly language in the clause that suggests that readers of the financial statements should use caution in relying on the listed asset valuations. But the clause doesn’t say the valuations are entirely worthless and does not tell readers that they should simply not believe anything they read in the statements. Rather, it suggests there had been a good-faith effort to value the assets using a variety of reasonable methods.\n\n“You can read it up and down; it doesn’t say, ‘I will lie to you, I will double or triple the value of these things — my statements in here are outright lies,’” CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen said last week.\n\nJudge asks whether testimony about 2011 documents was a ""waste of time""\n\nThe judge in former President Donald Trump’s civil trial Monday questioned whether lengthy witness testimony about 2011 financial documents was a “waste of time” because of statute of limitations applying to the case expired in 2014.\n\nAt the end of Monday’s court session, Judge Arthur Engoron responded to testimony from former Mazars account Donald Bender about the 2011 financial documents, acknowledging that a state appellate court had ruled the statute of limitations only allowed allegations from 2014 onward to apply in the case.\n\nThe defense agreed with Engoron’s assertion, prompting Trump to give a thumbs up.\n\nThe judge’s comment marked a small win for Trump because it showed the judge again recognizing the statute of limitations that had been decided by the appeals court.\n\nAt the same time, however, Engoron did allow the witness testimony about the 2011 financial documents on Monday over the objection of Trump’s attorneys, as the attorney general’s office indicated it would connect the testimony to allegations that fall within the statute of limitations.\n\nBender is returning for a second day of testimony on Tuesday.\n\nIn his ruling last week, Engoron wrote that the fraudulent statements of financial condition were still relevant in the case even if they’re for transactions completed before 2014 because they were submitted within the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nThe judge wrote that the attorney general’s office was not “challenging the loans, the closings, or the disbursements,” but was challenging the financial documents containing false and misleading information.\n\nMonday’s comments addressing admissible evidence do not indicate that Engoron will change that ruling.\n\nTrump\'s motorcade returns to Trump Tower after he attended first day of civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has returned to Trump Tower after spending the day attending his civil fraud trial in New York.\n\nThe trial is expected to last until December 22, according to Judge Arthur Engoron.\n\nAsked if he would return to court on Tuesday, Trump told reporters while leaving court for the day: “We may, I’d love not to. I’d love to be campaigning instead of doing this.”\n\nCivil fraud trial “took me off the campaign trail,"" Trump claims\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed that Monday’s civil fraud trial in New York took him “off the campaign trail” and cast the trial as a political attack against him.\n\nTrump was not required to attend the trial, which is a civil action — not a criminal case.\n\nDespite that the former president attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James’ $250 million lawsuit against him in the same manner that he has railed against the criminal charges he’s facing in four other jurisdictions.\n\nAsked whether he was returning for the trial on Tuesday, Trump said: “We may, I’d love not to. I’d love to be campaigning instead of doing this.”\n\nFact check: Trump baselessly claims federal Justice Department is behind New York civil fraud trial\n\nIn comments to reporters before Monday’s hearing, former President Donald Trump baselessly claimed that the federal Justice Department orchestrated the New York state civil fraud case and other cases against him.\n\n“It all comes down from the DOJ. They totally coordinate this in Washington,” Trump said. He added later in his remarks, “It’s all run by DOJ, which is corrupt, in Washington. Everything goes through them.”\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence that the Justice Department directed anyone to bring this state civil fraud case. The trial that began Monday stemmed from a lawsuit filed in 2022 by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who quickly began investigating Trump’s company upon being sworn in at the beginning of 2019 – when Trump still had two full years left in his presidency. Trump has correctly noted that James, a Democrat, herself ran on a campaign platform that included a vow to take on Trump.\n\nTrump also said in his Monday comments that “this trial could’ve been brought years ago, but they waited ‘til I was right in the middle of my campaign; the same with other trials and indictments.”\n\nIt’s true that a previous New York attorney general could conceivably have pursued the same case years ago, since the allegations pertain to conduct dating back more than a decade — but James brought the case in September 2022, roughly two months before Trump launched his 2024 campaign in November 2022.\n\nTrump faces two federal criminal cases that were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland; it’s fair to argue that the Justice Department is behind those cases.\n\nBut Trump has also baselessly alleged that the Justice Department is responsible for two criminal cases brought against him by local district attorneys in Manhattan, New York, and Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nTrump says he attended the civil trial because he wanted ""to watch this witch hunt"" himself\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he attended the civil fraud trial against him that began Monday in New York so he could “watch this witch hunt myself.”\n\nTrump was not required to appear in court Monday for the trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives. But he chose to attend and sit in the Manhattan courtroom – while giving multiple statements attacking the proceedings as he entered and exited.\n\nHe continued to rail against Arthur Engoron, the judge overseeing his civil trial, saying he should be disbarred after he ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case.\n\nTrump criticizes judge overseeing civil fraud case\n\nFormer President Donald Trump attacked Arthur Engoron, the judge overseeing his civil case, as he left the courtroom during a lunch break following opening statements this morning.\n\nTrump called Engoron a Democrat and “an operative,” saying that the case against him was a “disgrace.” He also attacked the New York Attorney General Letitia James for going after him instead of violent crime.\n\n“We’re going to be here for months with a judge that already made up his mind. It’s ridiculous,” Trump said.\n\n“They waste their time with this, with banks that were very happy that got all their money back. They weren’t defrauded. I’ve been defrauded,” Trump said.\n\nAsked if he was coming back to the courtroom after lunch, Trump said, “probably.”\n\nEngoron ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case, one of the seven claims that are a part of the lawsuit.\n\nWatching Trump\'s body language in court\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has not expressed much emotion in the courtroom for the first session of the criminal fraud trial.\n\nDuring the four opening statements, Trump sat at the defense table between two of his lawyers. He never spoke to the judge. Trump often faced forward, watching the small video monitor in front of him which displayed the opening presentations by the state and his defense lawyer.\n\nWhen Alina Habba and Cliff Robert, who are lawyers for Trump’s co-defendants, spoke without video presentations, Trump looked at them intently. Habba, who represents Allen Weiselberg, Jeff McConney and other employees of the Trump Organization, at times turned to Trump when she was discussing the valuation of his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nAs Trump’s lawyer, Christopher Kise, answered questions from the judge, Trump wrote notes and passed them to him. Eric Trump, who is also a defendant, sat in the front row of the courtroom gallery, on the defense side behind and to his father’s left. New York State Attorney General Letitia James sat in the front row on the other side of the courtroom, behind the former president and about 15 feet to his right.\n\nTrump only once looked at James, as he left the courtroom for the lunch break, turning his head as he walked past where she was seated. Eric Trump stopped and shook her hands using both of his hands as he followed his father out of the courtroom.\n\nJudge pushes back after Trump lawyer attacks New York attorney general in opening statement\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron rebutted attacks from Donald Trump’s attorney Alina Habba against New York Attorney General Letitia James, responding to her opening statement and getting into a debate with the attorney over her claims.\n\nIn her statement, Habba attacked James for saying in her campaign for attorney general that she was going to “get Trump.”\n\nEngoron, who ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case against Trump, responded by noting that the defense already tried to dismiss the case claiming that James brought it as a “witch hunt” against Trump.\n\nTrump intently watched Habba as she sparred with the judge.\n\n“These statements of financial condition were current, current market value. The point is what were they worth then,” Engoron said, pushing back on Habba’s assertion that the inflated values showed what they could be sold for at some point in the future.\n\nAn accounting disclaimer from Mazars, Trump’s former accounting firm, essentially said, “We’re relying on the Trump Organization,” Engoron said. “That’s how I read it.”\n\n“No, your honor,” Habba responded, arguing that the Trump Organization relied on Mazars and “they’re the accountants.”\n\nTrump lawyer claims Mar-a-Lago would sell for $1 billion in opening statement\n\nAlina Habba, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, Allen Weisselberg, former Trump Organization chief financial officer, and other Trump Organization employees, delivered an opening statement in court Monday attacking New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nHabba’s comments echoed Trump — who has tried to tie the civil case against him in New York as an effort to attack him and his presidential campaign.\n\n“Ms. James said she was going to come into office and ‘get Trump,’” Habba said, claiming that the case could have been brought three years ago before she took office.\n\nHabba also criticized the valuations the judge gave for properties like Mar-a-Lago, which the judge valued at $18 million in his ruling last week, finding Trump and his co-defendants liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nHabba argued that if Trump was trying to show a higher net worth, he would have included things like the rights to “The Apprentice” and the Trump brand.\n\n“There would have been the brand, the same brand that got that man elected for president,” she said. “There’s a lot of people in this room that probably don’t like that and that’s why we’re here.”\n\nTrump was looking at Habba as she spoke in the courtroom.\n\nTrump posts clips of New York attorney general talking about suing the former president\n\nVideos of New York Attorney General Letitia James talking about suing Donald Trump were being posted on the former president’s social media account while he sat inside a Manhattan courtroom for the civil fraud trial that James brought against him.\n\nTrump is arguing that the case, which began Monday, is politically motivated.\n\nIn one video, James can be heard saying, “Oh we’re going to definitely sue him. We’re going to be a real pain in the ass.”\n\nIn another clip, she says, “What is fueling my soul right now is Trump.”\n\nThe videos are posted on social media platform Truth Social.\n\n“New York embarrassment Letitia James is politically targeting President Trump,” the text in one video reads. “Letitia James is abusing her office.”\n\nTrump\'s lawyer: ""He has made a fortune literally about being right about real estate""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s attorney Chris Kise began his opening statement with an understatement, saying their team has a “very different picture of the evidence.”\n\nKise said the former president’s real estate knowledge made him a billionaire.\n\nTrump continues to look ahead at the monitor displaying his organization’s loan agreements, and occasionally leaning over talking to his lawyer.\n\n“There may be wide variations between different valuations” of certain parts of the Trump Org.’s real estate portfolio, Kise said, but added the evidence at trial will show the asset valuations on Trump’s statements of financial condition comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nIn pictures: Trump in court for civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is at a New York City courthouse Monday for the start of a civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nLast week, a state Supreme Court judge found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The ruling was a significant victory for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a $250 million lawsuit last year alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nSee photos from inside and around the courthouse today:\n\nTrump claims civil fraud case is part of ""election interference"" against him\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed before walking into court Monday that the New York Attorney General’s civil case against him was part of an attempt to harm his campaign.\n\n“This has to do with election interference, plain and simple,” Trump said. “They’re trying to damage me, so I don’t do as well as I’m doing in the election.”\n\nTrump’s claims about election interference are the same attacks he’s made against all four of the criminal indictments against him.\n\nBefore entering the New York courtroom Monday, Trump attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, as well as Manhattan District Attorney General Alvin Bragg and the Justice Department, linking the civil action against him in New York with his criminal indictments, even though they are not related.\n\nTrump is surrounded by his attorneys in the courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is seated in a New York City courtroom flanked by his attorneys on each side of him.\n\nHis son Eric Trump is seated in the front row of the gallery on the defense side.\n\nThere are at least nine court officers in the room.\n\nTrump calls the civil fraud trial ""a scam"" and ""a sham""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said Monday that the civil fraud trial against him and his associates that is set to begin soon is a “continuation of the single greatest witch hunt of all time.”\n\nHe made the comments as he made his way to the courtroom where the trial will begin.\n\nTrump went on to attack Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James, saying “she was going to ‘get Trump’ before she even knew anything about me.”\n\n“She used this to run for governor. She failed in her attempt to run for governor,” he said. “She had virtually no following. She came back and she said, ‘well, now I will go back to get Trump again.’ And this what we have. It is a scam and a sham.”\n\nTrump added that his financial statements “are phenomenal,” and claimed, “no bank was affected, no bank was hurt.”\n\nDonald Trump appears in courthouse hallway\n\nDonald Trump walked through the hallway in court ahead of his civil fraud trial. He is talking to reporters right now.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court gives one win to Trump today\n\nThere have been a smattering of attempts to remove Donald Trump from the ballot next year based on his alleged role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court said it won’t take up one of those longshot challenges, rejecting an appeal from John Anthony Castro, a little-known candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nCastro’s case against Trump leans on a post-Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment that says any American official who takes an oath to uphold the US Constitution is disqualified from holding future office if they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” or have “given aid or comfort” to insurrectionists.\n\nThe case was denied without any comment or recorded vote.\n\nThere are still 14th Amendment challenges against Trump in Minnesota and Colorado, which are scheduled for trials later this year.\n\nEric Trump arrives at court\n\nDonald Trump’s son, Eric Trump, has arrived at the New York City court ahead of the civil fraud trial against the former president, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nThe civil trial over inflated assets in fraudulent financial statements come less than a week after a ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron that found Trump and his co-defendants are liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nNew York attorney general: ""No matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law""\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said in a short statement Monday morning, “My message is simple: No matter how powerful you are, no matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law.”\n\nThe attorney general noted that last week, a state Supreme Court judge found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements.

Altogether, available seating exceeds 100 people.\n\nPeople are still arriving.\n\nTrump heads to court for first day of civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump departed from Trump Tower and is en route to a New York City courthouse to attend the first day of the civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nMore on the trial: Opening statements in the trial over inflated assets will begin today. The trial comes less than a week after a ruling that found Trump and his co-defendants liable for “repeated” fraud.\n\nThe former president, his adult children and his closest business advisers are all listed as potential witnesses for both the New York attorney general and the defense. Being listed as a potential witness, however, does not mean they will be called to testify.\n\nDonald Trump and his adult children on witness lists in New York civil fraud case\n\nDonald Trump, his adult children, and his closest business advisors could be called to testify during the civil fraud trial expected to begin Monday in New York.\n\nTrump is listed on the witness lists submitted by the New York Attorney General and Trump’s legal team. The state and Trump’s lawyers need to be inclusive on their witness lists of any potential person they might want to call, or the judge could exclude the testimony.\n\nTrump previously sat for a deposition in the case and said he had little “if any” role in preparing the financial statements that a New York judge ruled last week were fraudulent.\n\nAlso on both lists are Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, defendants in the case and numerous current and former Trump Organization employees, including former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Most of the witnesses have also testified in video depositions\n\nIn civil cases defendants can be called to testify and, if they refuse the jury, or in this case the judge, can use that against them in weighing the evidence.\n\nThe New York attorney general’s office identified 28 witnesses they could call in the case, including Michael Cohen and Ivanka Trump. Ivanka Trump was initially a defendant in the case, but a New York appeals court struck her from the lawsuit saying the claims brought against her were too old.\n\nTrump’s attorneys identified 127 possible witnesses that they would call, including some of the lenders behind the loans at issue in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial begins today. Here\'s what to know\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will be in attendance Monday in a New York courtroom for the start of the civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nOpening statements in the civil trial over inflated assets in fraudulent financial statements come less than a week after a shocking ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron that found Trump and his co-defendants are liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nThe ruling was a significant victory for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the $250 million lawsuit last September alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nTrump inflated his net worth by as much as $3.6 billion in three separate years between 2011 and 2021, according to the attorney general’s office. Attorneys for Trump have refuted the claims, arguing that asset valuations are highly subjective and that they are still sorting through what the ruling means for the company’s future.\n\nWhat’s at stake at trial: Trump and his companies could be forced to pay hefty sums in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through their fraudulent business practices.\n\nEngoron will consider just how much the Trumps and their businesses will have to pay.\n\nThe judge is expected to consider claims of business records fraud and insurance fraud alleged in the lawsuit in connection to high-profile properties, though he already determined some broad level of fraud was perpetuated.\n\nThe six causes of action are falsifying business records, conspiracy to falsify business records, issuing false financial statements, conspiracy to falsify false financial statements, insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.\n\nJames’ lawsuit also asks the court to consider banning the Trumps from serving as officers of a business in New York and to stop the company from engaging in business transactions for five years.\n\nRead more about Trump’s fraud trial.\n\nTrump says he will attend his civil fraud trial in New York\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he will go to court in New York for his civil fraud trial on Monday.\n\nTrump had been expected to attend, and law enforcement and court employees had already been making security preparations for his potential appearance at the courthouse in Lower Manhattan on Monday and possibly Tuesday.\n\nTrump’s plans started to become clear after a federal judge in Florida granted his request to postpone a deposition in a separate case because it would conflict with the start of the New York trial.\n\nThe civil fraud case – brought in September 2022 by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Trump, his eldest sons, their companies and several executives – will begin at 10 a.m. Monday.\n\nRemember: Last week, the judge overseeing the case dealt Trump a major blow in ruling that the former president is liable for fraud and that he overvalued his properties on his financial statements for a decade.\n\nThe ruling came in response to the lawsuit by James, who is seeking $250 million in damages, a ban on the Trumps from serving as officers of a business in New York, and a ban on the company from engaging in business transactions for five years.\n\nTrump fraud trial in New York will start today after appeals court ruling\n\nThe trial in the New York attorney general’s civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump, his eldest sons, their companies and several executives, is set to begin Monday after a state appellate court denied Trump’s motion to stay the trial last week.\n\nThe trial comes in the wake of state Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron’s ruling Tuesday that Trump and his co-defendants are liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The judge will decide how much money the Trumps would pay the state.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James has alleged that Trump, three of his children, his companies and his business executives defrauded lenders, insurers and other entities.\n\nThe judge has set aside nearly three months for the trial.\n\nJudge finds Trump and his sons liable for fraud ahead of civil trial\n\nA New York judge found Donald Trump and his adult sons liable for fraud and canceled the Trump Organization’s business certification last week.\n\nThe ruling came in response to the lawsuit by New York Attorney General Letitia James — a case that is set to go to trial on Monday on the amount of damages owed.\n\nJames has alleged that Trump, three of his children, his companies and his business executives defrauded lenders, insurers and other entities. The state is seeking $250 million in damages, a ban on the Trumps from serving as officers of a business in New York and to stop the company from engaging in business transactions for five years.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron’s ruling is a complete rejection of Trump’s arguments that he didn’t inflate the values of his golf courses, hotels, homes at Mar-a-Lago and Seven Springs on financial statements.\n\nAmong other things, Trump is accused of inflating the value of his triplex apartment at Trump Tower by three times its size, resulting in an overvaluation of between $114 million to $207 million, Engoron wrote.\n\nThe judge canceled the business certifications of the Trump entities that are defendants in the case, including the Trump Organization — a major blow to the business that has been so synonymous with the former president’s personal brand.\n\nA receiver will be put in place to “manage the dissolution” of the corporate entities. There are two New York properties that are part of the lawsuit, the commercial tower at 40 Wall Street and the Trump family compound at Seven Springs.\n\nQuestions remain as to how the receiver would dissolve the properties, if the ruling would impact properties located outside of New York state, including Mar-a-Lago, and if the Trumps could transfer the New York-based assets into a new company located out of state.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67312116', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump testifies: Ex-president clashes with judge at New York ...', 'Snippet': 'The judge at Donald Trump\'s New York civil fraud trial has admonished him to ""answer the questions, no speeches"" as he began testimony in a case that could dismantle his business empire.

""In a trial, you never know what\'s going to come up.""\n\nUntil now, Mr Trump has not testified publicly in any of the other ongoing legal cases against him.\n\nBut he has previously clashed with Judge Engoron, who twice ruled that Mr Trump had violated a gag order forbidding him from criticising court staff and fined him $15,000, total.\n\nIn Monday\'s turn on the witness stand, he is to face a grilling, under oath, about evidence the trial has heard that he directed asset values to be fraudulently inflated so his company could secure favourable loans.\u200b\n\nThe former president has frequently attended the trial in person and shared his displeasure about his former lawyer Michael Cohen, the judge, the attorney general, and even court employees throughout the trial.\n\nWhen Mr Cohen testified against him, Mr Trump abruptly left court after the judge ruled against him. Apparently caught off-guard, his Secret Service detail hurried to catch up with him.\n\nThere have been several remarkable moments in the Trumps\' court case.\n\nHis sons\' turns on the stand were particularly memorable. Both maintained their innocence.\n\nDonald Trump Jr cracked jokes. ""I should have worn make-up,"" he said to photographers and asked a court sketch artist to make him ""look sexy"".\n\nThere are others testifying in the case as well.\n\nAnother co-defendant is former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, who has previously pleaded guilty to tax crimes.\n\nJeff McConney, a Trump Organization executive from 1987 until February this year, was granted immunity in this case to flip against the Trumps.

Trump’s speech was scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. MST, with doors opening for the rally at 2 p.m. His speech began a bit later than scheduled, at about 7:17 p.m. Other speakers included Kari Lake, state Rep. Mark Finchem, Rep. Paul Gosar, Rep. Andy Biggs, Rep. Debbie Lesko, Kelli Ward, Mike Lindell, and Boris Epshteyn, Axios reported.\n\nIn the afternoon, just a couple of hours after doors opened, thousands of people were already at the festival grounds, AZ Central reported. The publication noted that traffic was stalled for about an hour outside the rally venue, and some attendees still hadn’t gotten inside after waiting more than three hours.\n\nYahoo! News (via the Arizona Republic) reported that more than 15,000 were in attendance at the rally. Meanwhile, Liz Willis of the right-wing network RSBN had indicated during the rally that attendance was about 20,000, according to a tweet that her official account retweeted. The Town of Florence Police Department had written on January 13 that they projected an attendance of close to 30,000.\n\nSteven Monacelli of Rolling Stone, The Daily Beast, and Dallas Weekly tweeted that when he arrived at the rally, he and other members of the press were told the press tower was full, even while others were still being let in the gates.\n\nHe later shared that although some of the press who were with him weren’t allowed inside, he was able to get into the rally.\n\nEd Henry of the conservative publication Real America’s Voice shared these photos of the crowd.\n\nWill Steakin of ABC News tweeted that Anthony Kern, a former Arizona lawmaker who was at the Capitol on January 6, addressed the crowd before Trump and told the rally: “This is our 1776 movement.”\n\nSteakin said the crowd could be heard saying “lock him up” at one point, in reference to Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nHere’s another crowd photo, shared by Monacelli on Twitter:\n\nDuring Trump’s speech, he called Biden “a disaster” for the country and let Kari Lake join him briefly on the stage. Lake is the Republican candidate for governor.\n\nHe also vowed during his speech to have his own investigation of the January 6 Capitol riots.\n\nSteakin reported that Trump’s rally ended with a new song by Sam and Dave called, “Hold on I’m Coming.”\n\nOn Twitter, the video below was shared showing the crowd at the rally.\n\nTrump said in the video above that some officials indicated this might be the “single biggest crowd seen yet.” However, other Trump rallies have recorded attendance numbers larger than the current estimate of 15,000. A 2019 Minneapolis Trump rally, for example, had a low estimate of 20,000, not including overflow. Trump did add: “and they’re not just talking about Arizona,” to his statement about the crowd size.\n\nThis Was Trump’s First Rally of 2022\n\nThis was Trump’s first rally of 2022.

Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar and Debbie Lesko, as well as GOP challengers Eli Crane and Kelly Cooper. Trump notably didn’t mention Rep. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani, who is the GOP nominee in a Tucson-area district.\n\nAfter doing so, Trump again turned to the dark imagery of an America in chaos because of Democratic policies. He complained of inflation and declining stocks, dead U.S. soldiers and wasted hardware in Afghanistan and with Ukraine at war.\n\n“We are a nation in decline,” Trump said near the end of his speech as sorrowful sounding music played. “We are a nation that in many ways has become a joke.”\n\n“But we are not going to allow this horror to continue,” he said. “It is hard-working patriots like you who are going to save this country.”\n\nBy the time Trump was ending his speech, many in the crowd already had walked away.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n6:40 p.m.: Trump ends speech in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has concluded his remarks at a rally in Mesa. Trump spoke for more than 90 minutes, airing many of the grievances he has repeated for years, while also giving attention to Republican candidates that he is backing in the state.\n\n6:10 p.m.: Trump says World War III could happen soon\n\nThe planet could be on the verge of World War III, former President Donald Trump said Sunday, blaming the Biden administration for failing to avert the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the spiraling tensions over it.\n\nWith characteristic self-congratulation, Trump praised himself for being correct about “everything” but said he hopes he is wrong that another global war could be on the horizon.\n\n“We must demand immediate negotiation of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine or we will end up in World War III, and there will never be a war like this. We will never have had a war like this, and that’s all because of stupid people that don’t have a clue. And it’s also because of the kind of weaponry that’s available today.”\n\nTrump castigated Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as a reliable vote for ill-considered legislation pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nMore than 45 minutes into his remarks, Trump returned repeatedly to claims of a stolen election in 2020. He called 2020 a “rigged and stolen election.”\n\n“I ran twice. I won twice,” Trump said.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen and Alison Steinbach\n\n5:55 p.m.: Trump claims predecessors took classified records\n\nFormer President Donald Trump unloaded on the FBI and accused his presidential predecessors over the criminal investigation of the documents seized from his residence at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe alluded to a third presidential run that won’t get derailed by what he views as politically motivated attacks on him.\n\n“What they’re trying to do is take us out so we can’t represent you if we decide to do that, but we’ll be making a decision very soon,” he said to rising cheers.\n\nTrump claimed that former President Bill Clinton took millions of classified records with him when he left office, and presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama also improperly took records as well.\n\nClinton lost the nuclear codes and former President Jimmy Carter sent the nuclear codes to a dry cleaner, Trump said, adding that nothing happened in those matters.\n\n“Lock her up! Lock her up!” the crowd chanted after Trump mentioned former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton kept private from officials government emails.\n\n“They should give me back everything that was taken,” Trump said of the records taken by the FBI.\n\n“They plant documents,” he said of the FBI. Trump wondered aloud when the Clintons would face investigation and prosecution.\n\n“I don’t think they will do it, and I don’t think they should do it,” Trump said.\n\nDespite his complaints, Trump said the actions against him drove his poll numbers higher.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5:30 p.m.: Trump starts speech with familiar topics\n\nFormer President Donald Trump wasted no time on Sunday launching into familiar grievances and a bleak image of America without him in the White House.\n\nCiting the influx of illegal immigrants, soaring prices and arrests of people who oppose abortion, Trump hit President Joe Biden and Democrats generally for a country in turmoil.\n\n“These are incredible people. They’re being treated like terrorists,” Trump said, vaguely alluding to those who support him or conservative causes.\n\n“Nothing happens to antifa. Nothing happens to (Black Lives Matter). But look at what happens to patriots. The Democrats are locking up their political opponents,"" he said.\n\nTrump put himself and his many controversies as the central evidence of Democrats abusing their power to hurt Republican opponents.\n\nHe complained of impeachment over what he again referred to a “perfect phone call” where he tied approval of military aid to Ukraine to that country declaring an investigation of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHe described his conversation with Georgia election officials that is under criminal investigation “an absolutely perfect phone call.”\n\nWithin seconds of taking the stage, Trump had complained about the media, alluded to his baseless claims of a stolen election and hinted that more elections could lie ahead.\n\n“We won it big and we won it a second time,” Trump said early on.\n\nHe took the stage in sun-splashed Mesa an hour later than scheduled, though those in the crowd of perhaps 5,000 at the event had stuck around without any obvious complaints.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5 p.m.: Trump takes the stage in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump started speaking to the crowd in Mesa just before 5 p.m. Sunday, about an hour later than scheduled. He started his remarks by repeating his false claim that he won Arizona in 2020 and went on the attack against Democrats.\n\n4:50 p.m.: Lake fires up crowd, but doesn\'t mention 2020 election\n\nRepublican candidate for Arizona governor Kari Lake, the former television news anchor, spoke for 18 minutes on Sunday — without once mentioning the 2020 election and the false claims about it that propelled her to political prominence.\n\nInstead, Lake painted her Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs as an absent candidate who refused to debate her, while Lake has toured the state speaking directly to voters. She connected Hobbs to the Biden administration, claiming Hobbs would raise taxes on Arizonans already feeling the brunt of record-high inflation. Hobbs has said she does not plan to do so, and either candidate would need the Legislature’s agreement to change tax policy.\n\nLake repeatedly noted a discrimination case Hobbs was involved in while Hobbs was the Democratic leader in the state Senate. A Black female Democratic staffer proved to two juries she was discriminated against and fired in retaliation by Hobbs and others after raising an issue over her pay disparity.\n\nThose verdicts, Lake said, showed Hobbs had already embarrassed the state and should not lead it. Her attacks prompted cheers from the crowd.\n\n“They’re saying lock her up,” Lake said. “I think we should just vote her out, how’s that?”\n\nLake proved victorious in August’s four-way primary election with the backing of Trump, who remains polarizing in politics. And though claims about the 2020 election being stolen or corrupt are a hallmark of her campaign — she has said she wouldn’t have certified Biden’s win in the state two years ago — she didn’t mention them Sunday.\n\nInstead, she pledged a crackdown at the border to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking and talked about economic hardship facing Arizonans. In a new policy proposal, Lake said she would work to prohibit municipalities from collecting taxes on groceries and rent. Doing both would require the Legislature to pass a bill.\n\n“It is said hard times create strong men, well they create strong women too,” she said. “And this woman is ready to put an end to the hard times. Who is ready to step up with me?”\n\nThe crowd chanted back: “Kari! Kari! Kari!”\n\n4 p.m.: Finchem promises changes to voting if elected secretary of state\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem’s walk-on music at the Mesa rally was the theme from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" To further his Western bona fides, and to take a swipe at East Coast commentators who mock his western vibe, Finchem wore his cowboy hat and sported his “Sunday Go-To Meeting Tie.“\n\nHe launched into his familiar attack on his Democratic opponent for secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, from Fontes’ missteps during the 2020 Democratic presidential preference election to his support of all-mail voting to policy changes that were slapped down by court rulings.\n\n“Just follow the law” is his campaign mantra, and he said he will stick to the rules.\n\nAs secretary of state, Finchem said he will push for post-election audits in all 15 counties and disconnect Arizona from ERIC, the Electronic Registration Information Center, which shares voter information among states to ensure there is not double voting.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n3:40 p.m.: Masters continues to pound Kelly over border, drugs, crime\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued his aggressive attacks on Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., saying he should have to attend the funerals of overdose victims killed by drugs that entered America from its porous borders.\n\nMasters rattled off a familiar list of complaints about current conditions: There are 300,000 people crossing the nation’s border each month, violent crime has soared in Phoenix since 2019 and fentanyl continues to kill Americans everywhere.\n\n“Mark Kelly has been radio silent about fentanyl for 22 months,” Masters said. That ended last week, Masters said, because he had a debate with Masters.\n\n“One month before Election Day, he says, ‘Uh oh. I better pretend to start doing something about fentanyl,’” Masters said, adding that 2,000 Arizonans have died from the drug in the past year.\n\n“I think Mark Kelly should have to attend the funerals. Let him look a grieving mother in the eye and he can explain to her why he failed to even lift a finger to secure our border,” Masters said.\n\nHis words extend attacks on Kelly that shot to prominence last week during the debate between the Senate candidates.\n\nMasters took the stage to “Danger Zone,” the song made famous in both installments of the movie “Top Gun” that is about Navy pilots. It would seem a curious choice. Kelly was a Navy fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut, while Masters never served in the military.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n3 p.m.: Hamadeh, Lesko describe a country in turmoil\n\nAbe Hamadeh, a Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona attorney general, characterized Arizona as on the front lines of defending America in a short speech at the rally in Mesa.\n\n“Arizona, we shocked the hell out of the establishment on Aug. 2, and are you ready to do it again?” Hamadeh said to loud applause.\n\nHamadeh said Democrats have harmed the country in the past couple years, citing inflation, drugs and “terrorists” crossing the border with Mexico, critical race theory in schools, censorship from big tech and Democrats who are “weaponizing the law and targeting patriots.”\n\n“Arizona is on the front lines of so many of the battles facing our country, and if we lose Arizona, we lose our country, but we’re not going to lose. We’re not going to lose because President Trump is still fighting for America,” he said.\n\nAs attorney general, Hamadeh said he would fight criminals, drug cartels and the federal government and “lock up some people and put handcuffs on them,” prompting cheers in the crowd of “lock them up.”\n\n“America has been down before, but America has never been out. The rest of the country is watching, they’re watching what we do right here in Arizona, because if we win, there’s still hope for America. And when we win, when we win, Arizona will lead America’s greatest comeback and never look back,"" he said.\n\nThe dark imagery was a theme among speakers.\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., described a dystopian America on the verge of collapse in the hands of Democrats in her remarks Sunday.\n\nInflation, a “totally open border,” fentanyl and violent crime have surged under President Joe Biden with help from congressional Democrats, Lesko told the crowd in Mesa.\n\nAnd authorities have hounded Trump since he began his political career, she said.\n\n“They continue to go after President Trump for six years,” she said, also lamenting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “to take away our rights” presumably during the pandemic.\n\n“If our country is going to survive, this has got to stop,” Lesko said.\n\n— Alison Steinbach and Ronald J. Hansen\n\n2:40 p.m.: Republicans rally with Katie Hobbs in Paradise Valley\n\nDemocratic candidate for governor Katie Hobbs held a brief news conference Sunday morning at Barry Goldwater Memorial Park in Paradise Valley to emphasize that Republicans should support her over rival Kari Lake.\n\nSeveral members of Hobbs’ “Republicans for Katie Hobbs Coalition” gathered with her at the park, which celebrates the state’s conservative icon who died in 1998 following five terms as a U.S. senator.\n\nKarie Dozer, a former spokesman for the late state Attorney General Grant Woods, said Goldwater would be “shaking his head in disgust” at how “crazy” Republican politics have become.\n\nKari Lake is “dangerous for Arizona,” said Mesa Mayor John Giles, and that’s why he — a Republican — was at the park with Hobbs and not at Trump’s rally in Mesa on Sunday.\n\n“Those of us who support Secretary Hobbs care very deeply about the future of Arizona,” he said. “And that’s why we are putting our state above our party.”\n\nNovember’s election wasn’t between Republicans and Democrats, but “a choice between sanity and chaos,” he added.\n\nMonica Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, describing herself as a former Republican, emphasized that the nation has “moved forward” under Biden.\n\nShe didn’t leave the party, she said — it left her when it began running “candidates operating from places of hatred, hubris and hostility rather than honesty, humility and humanity.”\n\nHobbs, repeating Giles’ statement about “sanity” and “chaos,” said the problem isn’t just that Lake “proudly accepts support from Nazis and spews dang conspiracy theories, it’s what she would actually do as governor.”\n\nHobbs then ran down a litany of Lake’s positions, including her support for a territorial-era anti-abortion law, baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, and surveillance cameras in public-school classrooms.\n\nLake’s entire platform “boils down into being a sore loser,” she said.\n\nOther Republicans at the event included former Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana and former state legislator Steve May.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n2 p.m.: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appears at rally\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., echoed the language of the Great Replacement theory popular with white nationalists in her message to Arizonans in Mesa on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking about illegal immigration, Greene said 5 million people have crossed the Mexican border with impunity from a derelict President Joe Biden.\n\n“Five million people from all over the world have crossed our borders,” Greene said. “Joe Biden’s 5 million illegal aliens are on the verge of replacing you, replacing your jobs, replacing your kids in school, and coming from all over the world they are also replacing your culture. That’s not great for America.”\n\nThe replacement theory is an idea first popular among white nationalists that Democrats want illegal immigrants to keep their party politically viable.\n\nSome Republicans have flirted with similar rhetoric to energize their base, which has long seen the border as dangerously porous.\n\nGreene has long pushed a nationalist message. Last year, Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., were briefly linked to creating an America First Caucus that was reportedly linked to preserving the nation’s Anglo-Saxon past and dramatically restricting the nation’s immigration laws. Both lawmakers quickly distanced themselves from the caucus idea after bipartisan pushback.\n\nBefore taking the stage, Greene predicted the shifting state of Arizona’s law on abortion rights would not play a significant role in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe state’s guiding law seems to have whipsawed between a Civil War-era law that bans nearly all abortions and a law passed earlier this year that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDespite the conflicting rulings and the attention it brings back to the issue, Greene said it won’t have an impact on voting in Arizona.\n\n“I don’t think it’s distracting at all,” she told a reporter before taking the stage in Mesa. Instead, America-first themes, like those identified by Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters, will resonate with voters, she said.\n\nGreene said she is looking forward to Republicans winning back the House of Representatives after the November elections. When that happens, she said, she will be placed on the House Oversight Committee, where she plans to open investigations into Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s embattled son.\n\nGreene also said Big Tech will face scrutiny over its “collusion” with Democrats in 2020 to censor conservative voices.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n1:45 p.m.: Trump, Lake supporters travel from Arizona, out of state\n\nAs the prayer, pledge of allegiance and national anthem began shortly before 1:30 p.m., attendees were still streaming into the dirt lot at Bell Bank Park. Seats were filled in the relatively small area of floor seating and risers around the speaking platform.\n\nAfter the national anthem, a chant of “USA, USA, USA” rose through the crowd. Many wore Trump attire, some wore anti-Biden clothes, and lots wore red, white and blue apparel, including a few people draped in American or Arizona flags.\n\nA few people were carried out on stretchers; it was a hot and sunny afternoon.\n\n“We’re just real Trump people,” said Ann-Marie Villicana, who drove from Pasadena, California, on Saturday to see Trump on Sunday.\n\nVillicana said she founded LA Trump and was a delegate from California in 2016. One of her friends is working with Lake so she came out to show support.\n\n“Since we haven’t been able to get out to Arizona to help Kari Lake, we thought the least we could do was donate money, get great seats,” she said. She and Robin Salzer had VIP seats.\n\n“People are just fed up and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” Salzer said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Schafer of Chandler voted for Trump and is a big supporter but said she hadn’t gone to one of his events until Sunday.\n\n“I am brokenhearted that America is in the condition it’s in,” she said, adding that she’s concerned about issues like inflation, the 2nd Amendment and school curriculum.\n\nSchaefer was excited to hear from Trump and Lake in particular. “I’m 100% Trumpster, I’m 100% Kari Lake,” she said, wearing a Trump shirt and hat. She said the midterm election will be “honest” because so many more people are paying attention.\n\nMaria Foshay traveled from Rancho Cucamonga, California, to hear Trump speak. She hopes he’ll announce his next move during the speech, ideally that he’ll run for president again in 2024. Foshay wants to make sure the election is truthful, fair and with “no cheating.”\n\nKerry Josey of Mesa said Trump is “the face of the people,” adding that she’s been to three of his rallies. She’s concerned about whether the upcoming election will be truthful.\n\nKathy Elgin stood out in the sea of red-colored couture with her eye-catching Oregon Women for Trump-shirt. She and four friends flew in from Oregon for a quick turnaround trip solely for Trump.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” Elgin said.\n\nA resident of Salem, Elgin said Oregon was a red state “until we got mail-in voting.” Since then, she said, the state has turned blue and she doesn’t buy it.\n\nAn avid Trump follower, Elgin said she got a visit from FBI after returning from the Jan. 6 rally at the U.S. Capitol. She called the visit “audacious” explaining that she never witnessed any violence at the Capitol until she saw television footing.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, Eryka Forquer and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n12 p.m.: Who is scheduled to speak at Trump rally in Mesa\n\nThe speaker list for Sunday\'s rally includes names familiar to Arizonans, as well as some of the more outspoken Trump advocates, including U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nTwo members of Arizona\'s congressional delegation are on board to address the rally: Republican representatives Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko.\n\nThey will join former Trump administration staffers Rich Grenell and Kash Patel, who were with Trump at a similar rally in Nevada on Saturday.\n\nGrenell served briefly as acting director of National Intelligence in 2020, while also holding the posts of U.S. ambassador to Germany and special presidential envoy for the Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations.\n\nPatel was former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nThe event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November\'s election. Arizona candidates slated to speak are gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. U.S. Senate nominee Blake Masters, secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem and attorney general nominee Abe Hamedeh.\n\nThe speeches are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n11 a.m.: Masters: \'This race is winnable\'\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued what amounted to a victory lap ahead of his rally with former President Donald Trump in Mesa later today.\n\nMasters appeared with Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" on Fox News and made the case that his showing in Thursday\'s debate with Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., had reversed the race.\n\n""I expected him to struggle to defend (his record in the Senate) and he did,"" Masters said of Kelly. ""All I had to do, Maria, was go out there and tell the truth. Explain to the people how Mark Kelly has kept our border wide open, how his votes for all the crazy trillions of dollars in spending have caused inflation.""\n\n""I think we had him on the ropes a little bit, and it\'s a huge vibe shift, a momentum shift for our campaign,"" he continued.\n\nAsked about the lack of financial investment from some conservative corners, Masters predicted, ""a lot more people are going to get involved.""\n\n""I think I showed people that this race is winnable, that I\'m a much, much better candidate than Sen. Kelly in that debate the other night.""\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n10 a.m.: Lake and Hobbs on national TV prior to Trump rally\n\nArizona’s candidates for governor appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation morning news show Sunday, just hours ahead of Trump’s visit to the state.\n\nThe former president wasn’t the focus of the discussion; instead, Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs and Republican nominee Kari Lake discussed their plans for border security, abortion and other issues, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nThe interviews, conducted separately and aired back to back, might be the closest equivalent to a debate a national audience will see this cycle. They highlighted the stylistic and policy differences of two women locked in a nationally watched race that most polls say is tied.\n\nLake has shifted from praising a near-total ban on abortion to saying she will follow the law. She did so again Sunday. Arizona has two conflicting laws on the books, but a court ruling Friday has allowed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks except for in medical emergencies to prevail.\n\nLake told CBS news correspondent Major Garrett the “law right now as it stands is Gov. Ducey\'s law at 15 weeks, so we\'ll follow the law,” according to a transcript of the interview.\n\nGarrett likewise tried to pin down Hobbs’ position on abortion, which Lake has painted as extreme because Hobbs has repeatedly declined to say if there is a stage of pregnancy after which she thinks abortion should be prohibited. Pressed on that, Garrett asked Hobbs if an Arizona voter would be right to conclude that she does “not favor any specific week limit on abortion.”\n\n“I support leaving the decision between a woman and her doctor and leaving politicians entirely out of it,” Hobbs replied.\n\nLake spent much of her interview talking about her plan to use state law enforcement as border patrol and deportation officers, an authority she’d seek using an untested legal theory that would buck decades of court precedent and likely lead to a lawsuit.\n\n“I hope that Joe Biden doesn\'t fight us because then it would really look like he is on the side of the cartel,” she said.\n\nLake didn’t mention Trump in her interview, perhaps a reflection of his unpopularity with voters nationally. Hobbs brought up the former president twice, attacking his record at the southern border and his false claims the 2020 election was “stolen,” which Lake has parroted.\n\nHobbs said Trump’s effort to build the border wall, the signature of his border policy, wasn’t finished and called on the Biden administration to “step up.”\n\nAsked why she wouldn’t debate Lake, and if her decision not to participate shortchanged voters of a chance to see how Hobbs would respond in a moment of duress, Hobbs shifted to Trump.\n\n“I think the voters of Arizona have had a chance to see how I work under crisis throughout my leadership during the 2020 election as secretary of state,” Hobbs said, “when we had to combat multiple election challenges from former President Trump and his band of election deniers, including my opponent Kari Lake.""\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n9 a.m.: 17 visits and counting\n\nArizona\'s political preeminence seems like a given these days, but the red state-turned-purple battleground coincides almost perfectly with the political rise of Donald Trump.\n\nThe former president found early enthusiasm for his America-first message in Arizona in 2015, and he never really stopped coming back.\n\nHis scheduled rally in Mesa will add to an Arizona total no president or presidential contender can rival, with big asterisks for Barry Goldwater and John McCain, who lived in the state while pursuing the White House.\n\nAccording to Republic research, Trump has made at least 17 visits since entering politics.\n\nThat is a list that began on July 11, 2015, with a stop in Phoenix that focused on immigration and helped set the tone for his upstart campaign.\n\nBy the end of the 2016 campaign, Trump made six more stops in Arizona. He carried the state by 3.5 percentage points, an unusually low margin in a state that had voted Republican in all but one presidential election beginning in 1952.\n\nTrump visited the state seven times in 2020. That included a Feb. 19, 2020, rally in Phoenix just weeks before the pandemic halted campaign visits for months.\n\nIn May 2020, Trump started to move about again, with a stop at a Phoenix Honeywell facility making respirator masks to cope with the health crisis and to discuss aid to Native Americans.\n\nHe wound up losing Arizona in 2020 by fewer than 11,000 votes, the smallest margin in the country.\n\nTrump made his first post-presidential visit to Arizona on July 24, 2021, at a Turning Point Action rally in Phoenix in which he saw firsthand the raucous reception to Kari Lake by Republicans.\n\nHe wrongly predicted the ongoing review of Maricopa County ballots would vindicate his baseless claims of a stolen election.\n\nThis year, Trump held a January rally in Florence, a pre-primary rally in Prescott Valley in July and is set now to again back his slate of Republicans on Sunday in Mesa.\n\n— Ronald J.

And periodically, he will demand that videographers pivot their cameras around to capture the full extent of his devoted following.\n\nFor Donald Trump and his supporters, crowd size is more than just a bragging point. It’s proof that they are part of the American majority. “A person that comes here and has crowds that go further than the eye can see … and has cars that stretch out for 25 miles, that’s not somebody that lost an election,” Trump told the crowd at his rally in Florence, Arizona, on Saturday.\n\nBefore the 2020 election, Trump and his fans would often ask reporters how Joe Biden could possibly win when he didn’t have rallies as big as Trump’s. Now that Biden is president, Trump-rally goers say things like Trump couldn’t really have lost. Look at all of these people! In Arizona this weekend, 51-year-old Tammy Shutts put it this way to me: “100 percent, 1,000 percent, 1 million percent Biden didn’t win” her state, she said, gesturing to the hordes of people around her. “I’ve been in Arizona for almost 21 years. There is no way—no way—we went blue.”\n\nMany American liberals live in political bubbles. Some people in overwhelmingly blue parts of the country, for example, were shocked to find that Trump got so many votes in 2016. (“I live in a rather special world. I only know one person who voted for [Richard] Nixon,” the film critic Pauline Kael famously said of the former president, acknowledging her own political bubble just weeks after Nixon smashed George McGovern in 1972.) Some of those same blue-area Democrats were just as confident that Senator Elizabeth Warren would be the party nominee. But Republicans also live in bubbles.\n\nHuman beings aren’t particularly comfortable hearing information that challenges our closely held beliefs, and the urge to reject evidence that goes against our political opinions is especially strong. Reading only certain websites or watching particular TV channels shields Americans from facts and opinions they don’t like, and geographic sorting protects partisans from unpleasant interactions with people who hold different beliefs. Political segregation in America has increased dramatically in the past decade. “For about one in five Republicans, and two in five Democrats, less than a quarter of their neighbors belong to the opposite political party,” according to a recent study published in Nature. In other words, Trump voters might find it hard to believe that Biden won the election because their neighbors and friends mostly voted for Trump too.\n\nTrump’s rallies amplify these phenomena, Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard who co-wrote the Nature study, told me. “You have the president saying things, your neighbors who you [perceive as] saying the same things, and then these Trump rallies seem to be almost a social event,” he said. “Now you have an element of your social life, not just what you’re seeing on TV, that is caught up in believing these lies.” When you’re literally surrounded by believers, it’s hard to remember that doubters exist. Inside Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, for example, it can seem like the whole world is made up of Hawkeyes fans. Fortunately, that’s not true.

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January.

With many of the committee’s staff already departed, remaining aides have spent the last two weeks releasing many of the panel’s materials, including its 814-page final report, about 200 transcripts of witness interviews, and documents used to support its conclusions.\n\nLawmakers said they wanted to make their work public to underscore the seriousness of the attack and Trump’s multi-pronged effort to try to overturn the election.\n\n“Accountability is now critical to thwart any other future scheme to overturn an election,” Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., wrote in a departing message on Monday. “We have made a series of criminal referrals, and our system of Justice is responsible for what comes next.”\n\nWATCH: Key member of Jan. 6 committee on recommendation of charges against Trump\n\nSome of the committee’s work — such as videotape of hundreds of witness interviews — will not be made public immediately. The committee is sending those videos and some other committee records to the National Archives, which by law would make them available in 50 years. Members of the committee said they didn’t release that videotape now because it would have been too difficult to edit it and redact sensitive information.\n\nIncoming Republican leaders may try to get those materials much sooner, though. A provision in a package of proposed House rules released Sunday calls for the National Archives to transfer “any records related to the committee” back to the House no later than Jan. 17.\n\nIt is unclear whether the GOP-led House could enforce the provision and what they would do with the materials.\n\nThe committee’s conclusion comes after one of the most aggressive and wide-ranging congressional investigations in recent memory. The panel formally or informally interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, collected more than 1 million documents and held 10 well-watched hearings. The two Republicans and seven Democrats on the panel were able to conduct the investigation with little interference after House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy declined to appoint minority members, angry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had rejected two of his suggested appointments.\n\nIn the end, the panel came to a unanimous conclusion that Trump coordinated a “conspiracy” on multiple levels, pressuring states, federal officials and lawmakers to try to overturn his defeat, and inspired a violent mob of supporters to attack the Capitol and interrupt the certification of President Joe Biden’s win. The panel recommended that the Justice Department prosecute Trump on four crimes, including aiding an insurrection.\n\nREAD MORE: Jan. 6 panel releases final report, alleges Trump engaged in ‘conspiracy’ to overturn election\n\nWhile a so-called criminal referral has no real legal standing, it is a forceful statement by the committee and adds to political pressure already on Attorney General Merrick Garland and special counsel Jack Smith, who is conducting an investigation into Jan. 6 and Trump’s actions.\n\n“This is the most intense investigation I’ve been involved in,” said California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who has been in the House for almost three decades and served as an aide to a member on the House Judiciary Committee in the 1970s when Congress was preparing to impeach then-President Richard Nixon.

His defense lawyers also argued that special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into Trump had “significant overlap” with the House select committee’s investigation.\n\nWith the case slated to go to trial in March, Judge Tanya Chutkan is still considering several pretrial motions from Trump’s team, including long-shot motions to dismiss the entire case.

More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jun/08/legitimacy-jan-6-committee-explained/', 'Headline': 'PolitiFact | The legitimacy of the Jan. 6 committee, explained', 'Snippet': 'In December 2021, a three-judge panel ruled against Trump’s attempts to block the National Archives from turning over presidential correspondence and documents to the Jan. 6 committee.', 'Full_text': 'Critics argue that the House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, is illegitimate, amounting to a political hit job by Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans rather than a sober-minded quest to prevent disorder.\n\nThe critics also contend that the process of filling the committee’s seats was partisan, and that, as a result, the committee’s eventual composition is flawed.\n\nDespite the criticism, the committee has withstood legal challenges against it, and experts expect the committee will complete its work.\n\nWhat is the legal justification for committees of this sort?\n\nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention congressional investigations and oversight, but the courts have consistently upheld Congress’ right to undertake such activities, stemming from the text that says Congress possesses ""all legislative powers."" One of the Constitution’s framers, George Mason, said during its drafting that members of Congress ""are not only legislators but they possess inquisitorial powers.""\n\nPortrait of George Mason (public domain)\n\nWith the courts’ consistent backing, Congress has undertaken investigations over the past two centuries, from the Teapot Dome corruption scandal in the 1920s to the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation in 1974. (The House’s historical office also notes that such committees have been used for ""less noble purposes, such as the blacklisting of private citizens during the ‘un-American activities’ hearings in the 1950s."")\n\n""How is the Jan. 6 investigation different from previous ones? My answer is, it really isn’t,"" said James Robenalt, a lawyer and expert on Watergate.\n\nHow did the Jan. 6 committee come to be?\n\nInitially, Democrats and some Republicans wanted to create an independent commission, modeled after the one that investigated the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That proposed panel would have been made up of retired public officials, military leaders, and academics, rather than sitting members of Congress. The idea was to insulate the panel’s investigation as much as possible from the partisan fray.\n\nThe bipartisan commission would have included 10 members. House and Senate leaders for the Democratic Party would appoint the commission chair and four other members, while the Republican leaders would appoint the vice chair and four other members.\n\nThe day before the House voted on the legislation, Trump came out in opposition to it and called on Republicans to ""not approve the Democrat trap of the Jan. 6 Commission,"" arguing that it amounted to ""more partisan unfairness."" House Republican leaders joined Trump in opposition. Despite this, the House passed the legislation, with universal support from Democrats and the backing of 35 breakaway Republicans.\n\nBut the Senate killed the commission idea after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., came out against it, effectively ending any hope that the bill could get the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.\n\nDemocratic leaders’ Plan B was to establish a congressional select committee — a time-limited panel with a specific investigative charge. This could be accomplished by the House on its own; a simple majority in the House would carry the day.\n\n""Our bipartisan, good-faith proposal was met with a filibuster,"" House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said at the time. ""Now that Senate Republicans have chosen to block the formation of an independent commission, it falls to the House to stay the course and get the answers they deserve.""\n\nOn June 30, 2021, the House approved creation of the select committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the United States Capitol. The resolution passed by a 222-190 margin. Once again, Democrats were unified in support, but the number of Republican votes in favor withered to two: Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.\n\nUnder the resolution, ""the Speaker shall appoint 13 Members to the Select Committee, 5 of whom shall be appointed after consultation with the minority leader.""\n\nThis is where matters got even more convoluted. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., presented Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., with a slate of five nominees to the panel. Pelosi responded that she had no quarrel with three of them: Republican Reps. Rodney Davis of Illinois, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, and Troy Nehls of Texas. But she drew the line at two of McCarthy’s picks: Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, who was tapped for the panel’s ranking member slot, and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan. Pelosi maintained that Banks and Jordan were too closely tied to Trump to help carry out a credible investigation.\n\nAfter Pelosi rejected Banks and Jordan, McCarthy retracted all five of his nominations, including the three that Pelosi had said she’d accept. ""Speaker Nancy Pelosi has taken the unprecedented step of denying the minority party\'s picks for the Select Committee on January 6,"" McCarthy said at the time. ""This represents an egregious abuse of power and will irreparably damage this institution.""\n\nBut Pelosi had one last move. She proceeded to name the two Republicans who had voted to establish the committee — Cheney and Kinzinger — as members, joining seven Democrats. This produced a committee that was bipartisan, but excluded lawmakers who Democrats believed could be tempted to use the panel as a platform to justify the actions of Trump and his allies, rather than investigate them.\n\nJan. 6 Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., at the Capitol on April 4, 2022. (AP)\n\nWhy do critics say the panel is illegitimate?\n\nIn a lawsuit, the Republican National Committee argued that there were several problems with the select committee’s formation.\n\nFirst, rather than 13 members, as set out in the resolution, the panel ended up with only nine. Second, the panel has no ""ranking member,"" as had been called for in the resolution. And third, the Republicans on the committee were not ones recommended by the Republican leader, McCarthy.\n\nOn May 1, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that none of these concerns were enough to stop the committee\'s work. The ruling was made by Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee.\n\nKelly wrote that concern over the numerical divergence was ""not an unreasonable position,’"" but he added that the court ""must give ‘great weight’ to the House’s own actions,"" including two occasions when House Republicans failed to challenge the committee’s underlying legitimacy before casting votes related to the committee.\n\nThe House has also argued that there’s precedent for a committee with incomplete membership: a 2005 House panel to investigate the government response to Hurricane Katrina consisted of 11 Republicans and zero Democrats. (Ironically, at the time, Pelosi, then the House minority leader, called the panel a ""sham"" and refused to name committee members.)\n\nAs for the question of a ranking member, Kelly concluded that Cheney, as the panel’s vice chair, fulfilled the same function as a ranking member even if her title was different. And on the question of McCarthy’s lack of input, Kelly pointed to the resolution’s requirement that the speaker needed only to engage in ""consultation"" with the minority leader.\n\n""To ‘consult’ with Minority Leader McCarthy, all Speaker Pelosi had to do was ask for his ‘advice or opinion,’"" Kelly wrote. ""There is no dispute that she did. That she did not accept all his recommendations, and that Minority Leader McCarthy then withdrew all his recommendations, does not mean that Speaker Pelosi failed to consult with him.""\n\nAnother broad complaint in the lawsuit is that the committee’s actions are not advancing a valid legislative purpose.\n\nThis argument didn’t fly with Kelly, either, who noted the committee’s purpose was to investigate if legislation is necessary ""to avert a future Jan. 6-style attack."" He reasoned that the committee need not commit to specific legislation in advance of starting its work, since possible legislation could easily emerge once the committee’s efforts were underway.\n\nKelly’s decision was in line with an earlier decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In December 2021, a three-judge panel ruled against Trump’s attempts to block the National Archives from turning over presidential correspondence and documents to the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nThe appeals judges wrote that there are ""few, if any, more imperative interests squarely within Congress’s wheelhouse than ensuring the safe and uninterrupted conduct of its constitutionally assigned business.""\n\nFurther bolstering the House panel’s case is that a month later, the Supreme Court denied a motion by Trump to overturn the appeals court decision.\n\nThe collective result of these court decisions, Robenalt said, is to show that ""the committee was properly authorized and that Congress has the power to investigate for valid legislative purposes.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/january-6-committee-final-report-release-capitol-assault/', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 committee releases final report on Capitol riot, fixing blame on ...', 'Snippet': 'Jan. 6 report calls for barring Trump from office 02:09.

Here, the committee sets out to show that Trump planned even before the 2020 presidential election to declare prematurely that he had won. It quotes testimony by his campaign team in which they informed Trump that he had lost the election and that there had been no fraud.\n\nThe narrative walks through Trump\'s alleged post-election efforts to retain power, including attempts to replace slates of electors with fake alternate electors who would support him, alleged efforts to subvert the Justice Department by replacing officials who refused to make false statements that would help Trump remain in power and plans to stop Congress\' certification of the election on Jan. 6.\n\nRead the full final Jan. 6 House select committee report here\n\nThe report also lists 11 recommendations to prevent another Jan. 6. Among them: barring Trump from holding any federal or state office in the future and the passage of the Electoral Count Act to clarify the vice president\'s and Congress\' narrow roles in the presidential election and to make it more difficult to overturn the results.\n\nThe committee points out that the Constitution says individuals can be disqualified from holding public office if they ""engaged in an insurrection"" or gave ""aid or comfort"" to one.\n\nThe committee on Wednesday also began releasing transcripts from the months of testimony gathered, starting with 34 witnesses\' interviews. Those witnesses included Jeffrey Clark, John Eastman, Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, Nick Fuentes, Alex Jones, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Arizona Republican Party chairwoman Kelli Ward. In addition to recommending charges against Trump, the committee also recommended charges against Eastman, a law professor who proposed having Vice President Mike Pence refuse to count the electoral ballots of certain states that had voted for Joe Biden.\n\nThe transcripts confirmed many of the witnesses invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, including to questions about biographical details. Stone, for example, asserted his Fifth Amendment rights when asked where he resides and his age.\n\nLawyers for Clark, a former Justice Department official who the committee said ""stands out as a participant"" in an alleged conspiracy to defraud the United States, responded to the report with a statement Thursday night attacking the committee. They called it a ""political and public-relations bust"" and said, ""This is why, on its way out the door, the Committee is desperately trying to make a splash with criminal referrals it was obvious from the very start its members were going to make in an effort to try to destroy their conservative political opponents.""\n\nOn Thursday, the panel made public two transcripts from September interviews with Cassidy Hutchinson, a former top aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Hutchison testified before the committee in an explosive public hearing in late June, during which she discussed Trump\'s repeated demands to go to the Capitol on Jan. 6 and an interaction she learned of between the former president and the head of his security detail in a presidential vehicle after his speech on the Ellipse, which involved Trump allegedly lunging toward him when he was told he could not go to the Capitol.\n\nLater Thursday, the committee release the transcripts of interviews with former Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency Director Chris Krebs; Capitol rioter Stephen Ayres (Part 1, Part 2); former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, former Justice Department official Ken Klukowski (June 10, 2022), who was an aide to another Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark; and former special assistant to the president Sarah Matthew.\n\nThe committee published introductory materials to the report earlier this week, which included the committee\'s criminal referrals to the Justice Department for possible prosecution and 17 key findings from its investigation.\n\nThe panel recommended the Justice Department pursue at least four criminal charges against former President Donald Trump related to his alleged efforts to thwart the transfer of presidential power: obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement and incitement, rebellion or insurrection.\n\nDuring the course of its probe, the select committee held 10 public hearings, conducted interviews with more than 1,000 witnesses and collected more than 1 million pages of material. It issued subpoenas to Trump and some of his closest allies, though ultimately did not speak with the former president or former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe committee\'s hearings, the bulk of which were held over the summer, focused on what investigators said was a multi-part plan by Trump and his allies to reverse the results of the 2020 presidential election and keep the former president in office. The pressure campaign involved Pence, state lawmakers, election officials and the Justice Department, and culminated in the Jan. 6 attack, during which a mob of Trump\'s supporters breached the Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from re-affirming President Biden\'s electoral win, the panel alleged.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California and a member of the committee, told ""CBS Mornings"" on Wednesday that the decision to refer Trump for possible criminal charges was a ""somber decision to make, and not one we made lightly.""\n\n""We believe that with respect to inciting an insurrection and conspiracy to defraud and obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to lie ... that Donald Trump committed all of these offenses,"" Schiff said. ""And as the Congress itself was the victim of some of them, our democracy, all of them, that we had an obligation to report what we knew to the Justice Department.""\n\nTrump, who has launched a 2024 presidential bid, has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt."" He called the criminal referrals ""Fake charges made by the highly partisan Unselect Committee of January 6th"" in response to the release of the introductory materials earlier this week.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/read-full-jan-6-committee-report-detailing-investigation-capitol-attac-rcna63065', 'Headline': 'Read the full Jan. 6 committee report detailing its investigation into ...', 'Snippet': 'The panel voted Monday to recommend that the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump over his role.

Few in the GOP attended a New York rally alongside the pro-Trump lawmaker on Tuesday. by Li Zhou and Jen Kirby. Updated Apr 4 ...', 'Full_text': 'Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day. The rally, which Greene led alongside the New York Young Republicans, drew a crowd of a few dozen Trump supporters, counterprotesters, and curious New Yorkers — all of whom appeared to be outnumbered by media.\n\nThe rally in Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Court House, was less a protest and more like a bizarro carnival. Trump’s Tuesday arraignment took place on an rare New York spring day, which added to the frenetic vibe, as though everyone was unleashed after a long winter.\n\nThe MAGA hats and flags were out, as were a contingent of counterprotesters, imperfectly separated by metal barriers. New Yorkers mingled among them — an artist, a high schooler with a few free periods — who claimed to have wandered down to Lower Manhattan to witness history, or at least the spectacle. And then there were the reporters, swarming everyone in a red hat or with a halfway decent sign.\n\nBut prominent GOP politicians, not so much. The sparse attendance by other elected Republicans highlighted the limitations of what members of the party might be willing to do for Trump, even though they’ve broadly lambasted the charges against him as politically motivated and unfounded.\n\nGreene’s headlining of the event comes after Trump previously called for his supporters to “protest” the charges, a rallying cry that raised concerns of a repeat of the deadly January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when the former president similarly asked supporters to contest the election results. Embattled Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was also spotted by reporters in the crowd of the protest, and was seen headed toward the courthouse where the arraignment was set to take place. Other than that, maybe the highest-profile public figure was the Naked Cowboy.\n\nJanuary 6’s violence — and its legal fallout — have complicated efforts to drum up support for pro-Trump protests. While many lawmakers are eager to show their support for Trump, they’ve largely chosen to do so through fundraising efforts. A previous New York protest on March 20 was also poorly attended, and protests in South Carolina and California drew small crowds this past week as well. Most GOP lawmakers appear unwilling to put themselves in a position where they could be linked to Trump-related violence, and in the face of ongoing trials for insurrectionists, grassroots supporters appear hesitant to do so as well.\n\nThe New York Young Republicans pointedly described the Tuesday rally as a “peaceful protest” that called out the political persecution of Trump’s indictment, with Greene warning participants against violence. The crowd greeted Marjorie Taylor Green’s arrival to the rally with cheers and jeers, but throughout the morning until Trump’s arrival in Lower Manhattan, the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nRepublicans in general have harshly criticized the indictment and framed it as a way for Democrats to attack Trump yet again. Leaders like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), however, have previously urged “calmness” and pushed back on Trump’s calls for protest. They have assisted with the former president’s efforts to use the indictment to raise money, though. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) solicited donations on Fox News, for example, and the Trump campaign claims it’s brought in over $7 million in the past few days.\n\nThe lukewarm Republican response to Trump’s calls for protests, however, indicate that many in the GOP are only willing to go so far, particularly as the specter of the January 6 insurrection continues to loom over the party.\n\n“I think they calculate that they can take a goldilocks strategy — stay in the good graces of their base by not attacking him, but maintain plausible deniability in the future by not attending a protest,” says American University government professor David Barker.\n\nTrump is back, and no one seems to know quite what to make of it\n\nTuesday in Collect Pond Park, Trump supporters were angry about Trump’s indictment, but there was also a sense of anticipation: The thing Trump always said would happen — that he’d be targeted by an establishment that was out to get him — did. They were here to defend Trump, to support him, pray for him, and commiserate together.\n\nMelinda, 61, who drove up to New York from outside Fall’s Church, Virginia, sat on a bench in the park, hours before Trump’s arraignment. “I’m here to pray for the safety of the city and the people and President Trump,” she said.\n\nShe added that she loved her president, pointing to a pin of the presidential seal on the collar of the jacket. For her, the charges felt larger than just Trump. “What’s happening is they’re about to open a Pandora’s box. Because now, nobody’s safe,” Melinda said. “Any president, VP, Supreme Court justice, can now be publicly arrested, so I think it will boomerang.”\n\nThe crowd got bigger as the morning wore on and Trump’s arraignment loomed. There were red hats, of course, but maybe not as many as you might think. The rest fell into two camps: folks in sunglasses and T-shirts, as if they were NYC tourists; and the over-the-top. That included a guy in a banana suit — “Banana Republic” costume, as he explained — with a copy of the US Constitution in his hand.\n\nThe closer to Trump’s arraignment it got, the weirder it got, too: a woman, her body painted white, in a diaper. An Abe Lincoln. A guy in an orange jumpsuit, wearing a Trump mask. As inmate Trump worked the crowd, one woman pointed directly at him. “It’s Hillary Clinton,” she said, ignoring his face. “Hey, Hillary, you finally got locked up.”\n\nAnti-Trump protesters also filtered through. Jojo Keys, 39, from Manhattan, said he was an independent who had come to witness history. When Taylor Green entered the park, he jumped up and down, shouting “Liar, liar!”\n\nThere were also “Fuck Joe Biden” cheers and “USA” chants, and there was a cowbell, somewhere, of course. But mostly, the currency was signs. The ones you know: Make America Great, Trump 2024, Stop the Steal, Q. And then some new ones on the scene, some better than others: “Salem 1692 / Bragg 2023.” “From Build Back Better to Biden, Bragg, Banana Republic in 2 Years.”\n\nMichael Austin, a 59-year-old Manhattanite, had the Build Back Better to Banana Republic sign, which he rested at his feet. In his hands, he held a “Fags for Trump” sign. “It is a seven-year-long, slow-rolling constant coup d’etat,” Austin said. “They have used the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the DHS, and foreign spy agencies to persecute a reformer, who came to reform the corrupt system, and they don’t like it.”\n\nPretty much everyone had cameras out, filming or photographing the scene for their own memories, and maybe to make sure that they had evidence in case anything happened.\n\nThough nothing really did. People cheered, they chatted, they waited. Trump arrived at the courthouse in the afternoon, the crowd noting his arrival with helicopters overhead. “Trump is in the house,” one woman called out. But otherwise, the crowd stood, behind a fence and behind rows of television cameras, facing the court house, knowing, at least, that the former president was inside.\n\nThe lingering impact of January 6\n\nTrump’s calls for protests, which the former president posted in March as he anticipated the indictment, follow significant fallout from the January 6 insurrection. The storming of the Capitol ultimately led to five deaths, 140 injured police officers, and hundreds of arrests. It’s also proven to be politically damaging for Republicans following an intensive investigation by Congress’s January 6 committee, with polling showing that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the attack.\n\nConcerns about the violence that occurred on January 6 have hung over these potential rallies as well, with New York Mayor Eric Adams calling on Taylor Greene and other protesters to be on their “best behavior.” Multiple Republican lawmakers have made similar requests of Trump supporters, like McCarthy, who said in mid-March that “there should not be any violence.”\n\nRelatedly, pro-Trump backers have signaled reluctance about these protests amid concerns they could be a trap laid by federal agents, after more than a thousand people have been charged following the insurrection. As CNN’s Sean Lyngaas, Zachary Cohen, and Donie O’Sullivan reported, pro-Trump forums have included speculation that these demonstrations were a “set up” intended to pin blame on them for violence caused by other groups, like the antifa or antifascist movement. (On January 6, this incorrect theory was used by some Republicans to obscure the role of Trump supporters in the violence and damage that was caused.) An expert also told CNN that Trump backers may be seeking alternate routes to oppose the indictment including specific targeting of officials like District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe combination of lawmakers’ own apparent political concerns, and Trump supporters’ practical worries about a law enforcement “set up,” seem to have dampened the involvement in protests this week.\n\nFor Republican lawmakers, there’s been an ongoing balancing act regarding their backing for Trump. If they were to actively criticize and condemn him, they risk serious electoral blowback much like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who lost her Republican House primary. Tying themselves too closely to Trump, however, also comes with its own risks, particularly for lawmakers in more moderate states and districts. In the 2022 midterms, election-denier candidates in battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan broadly lost. And there are still a lot of unknowns about Trump’s legal woes, as he faces other potential charges in cases involving overturning the election results and his role in January 6.\n\n“Now they must calculate not just the current rank-and-file GOP rallying around Trump, but also what happens if more indictments tumble down in the coming months,” says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\n\nThese collective factors, it seems, have curbed the interest in these protests for now.\n\nUpdate, 5 pm ET: This story has been updated with crowd reactions throughout the arraignment day.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6186037/matt-gaetz-marjorie-taylor-greene-maga-house-republicans/', 'Headline': 'The MAGA Squad Is Building Power to Control the GOP Congress', 'Snippet': 'June 14, 2022 6:00 AM EDT. O n a Tuesday afternoon in late April, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene walks into the seventh-floor congressional office belonging to Representative Matt Gaetz ...', 'Full_text': ""On a Tuesday afternoon in late April, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene walks into the seventh-floor congressional office belonging to Representative Matt Gaetz, settles into a high-backed black leather chair, and fits a pair of headphones over her blonde hair. The taping is about to begin for the 38th episode of Gaetz’s “Firebrand” podcast, and Greene is the high-wattage guest star.\n\nGreene has come straight from Dulles Airport, so Gaetz takes a minute to catch her up on today’s topics before the recording starts. There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her.

That’s her story, anyway.\n\nIn a mint-green dress with a gold cross displayed prominently, the Georgia congresswoman appeared in an Atlanta courtroom Friday to testify under oath about whether she participated in an insurrection. “I don’t remember,” and “I don’t recall,” Greene testified repeatedly to straightforward questions on whether she’d talked about the Jan. 6 protest with other members of Congress, or any “Stop the Steal” organizers before the Capitol riot.\n\nGreene is facing a challenge from a group of constituents in her northwest Georgia district who say her alleged role in the violent Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol should disqualify her from running for re-election. The challenge was brought under a Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment that says officials who engage in “insurrection or rebellion” or have “given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof” should be barred from holding political office.\n\nThe question at the heart of the case is what an insurrection looks like in the year 2021—whether the Capitol riot fits that definition, and whether Greene’s words and conduct before, during, and after the attack make her culpable.\n\nFriday’s proceedings marked the first time a member of Congress has testified publicly, under oath, about their involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nAdministrative law judge Charles Beaudrot agreed to recognize the congresswoman as a “hostile witness,” after she repeatedly refused to answer or evaded questions about her social media posts and belief in the conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was “stolen” from former president Donald Trump.\n\nGreene even dodged questions about how she uses Twitter and Facebook and said she couldn’t recall specific incendiary messages she shared from her social media accounts prior to Jan. 6.\n\nShe also repeated false claims about a “tremendous amount of voter fraud” in the 2020 election, but asserted that it was “not accurate” that she hoped Congress would not certify Joe Biden as the election’s winner.\n\nGreene’s supporters packed the courtroom and cheered when she entered. They also clapped when Beaudrot dismissed the court for a break later in the morning. “This is not a show,” Beaudrot scolded them. “Do not do that.” Notable among Greene’s supporters present was Rep. Matt Gaetz, a right-wing congressman from Florida.\n\n“This was not a case where leaders were on horseback leading the charge,” said Ron Fein, legal director for Free Speech for People, a left-leaning civil liberties group, who cross-examined Greene. “The leaders were not standing in Richmond, Virginia, giving long-winded speeches to justify the mayhem. The leaders of this insurrection were among us, on Twitter, on Facebook. The evidence will show that Marjorie Taylor Greene was one of them.”\n\nGreene’s attorney, James Bopp Jr., called the legal challenge a “political smear” campaign against the controversial congresswoman, and asserted that Fein was glossing over key legal definitions of “insurrection” or “engaged.”\n\nFein asked Greene whether she thought if someone “broke the law in a way designed to interfere with the process of counting Electoral College votes,” would they be “an enemy of the constitution.”\n\n“You mean interrupting Congress?” replied Greene. “Interrupting Congress, like when the Democrats interrupted Congress and staged a sit-in?”\n\nShe also testified that she had no expectation of violence on Jan. 6. “I have never once seen violence from Trump people,” she claimed. “The only violence I had seen from antifa and BLM rallies.”\n\nFein, amid numerous objections from Bopp, grilled Greene about specific social media posts and past remarks—and likes of posts.\n\n“You’ve had your disagreements with [Nancy] Pelosi, right?” asked Fein.\n\n“Politically speaking, that would be correct,” Greene replied.\n\n“You don’t agree on a lot of things?” asked Fein. “Politically speaking, that would be correct,” she repeated.\n\n“You think Pelosi is a traitor to the country,” he said. “I’m not answering that question; it’s speculation,” she said.\n\nFein then pulled up an exhibit that showed Greene saying Pelosi was “a traitor to our country, guilty of treason.” He also asked her about a Facebook comment she appeared to “like” that said a “bullet to the head” would be a quicker way to remove Pelosi from office. “I have had many people manage my social media account,” said Greene, adding that she didn’t know who liked that one.\n\n“Are you testifying under oath that wasn’t you?” asked Fein.\n\n“I am testifying I had no idea who liked that comment,” Greene replied.\n\nFein also pointed to a CNN article (prompting snickers from the courtroom), quoting 2019 remarks by Greene (in the context of a protest to fund the Southern border wall), in which she said a good way for people to express their displeasure with the government is to “flood the Capitol.”\n\n“The Capitol belongs to the people,” she replied. When Fein read out additional comments from 2019 where Greene talked about the need to “rise up” and hoping “the American people” wouldn’t be forced to use non-peaceful means, she denied making them.\n\nGreene called Fein a “conspiracy theorist” by reading statements that were quoted in CNN, and said that the news outlet regularly prints lies about her. Fein then played a video that showed her making those same remarks, verbatim.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-marjorie-taylor-greene-protests-new-york-city-arraignment-president-indictment/', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene joins protests in New York City, chants with ...', 'Snippet': 'GOP Reps.

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/factchecking-claims-about-the-jan-6-capitol-riot/', 'Headline': 'FactChecking Claims About the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot', 'Snippet': 'Posted on January 6, 2022. The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was the culmination of months of false claims about election fraud, including a litany recited by then-President Donald ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/nancy-pelosi-january-6th-camera-crew-action/', 'Headline': 'Documentary footage of Pelosi on Jan. 6, 2021, doesn’t ... - Poynter', 'Snippet': 'Newly released security camera footage captured on Jan. 6, 2021, shows Nancy Pelosi being filmed by her daughter, documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, during the Capitol attack.', 'Full_text': 'A fraud. A villain.\n\nIn his June 3 Facebook post, that’s how conservative activist Benny Johnson described Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for her role on Jan. 6, 2021 — the day a crowd of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nNewly released Jan. 6, 2021, footage shows the then-House speaker, her staff and security detail walking through the corridors of the Capitol. Johnson claimed that footage proved Pelosi had a nefarious role in the incident.\n\n“She had a camera crew follow her around on January 6th,” he wrote. “New tapes show her waiting to stage her escape until the camera man (her daughter) said, ‘Action!’ It was all a movie. It was a script. It was all planned.”\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\nJohnson did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but the new footage he appears to have referred to was posted on Just The News, a conservative website founded by John Solomon, a journalist and opinion writer whose past work has furthered unproven narratives.\n\nThe video, which Solomon described as Capitol Police security footage that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy “made available” to Just The News, has no sound. It shows Pelosi walking through the corridors alongside members of her staff and security personnel. In the video, a woman who remains just steps away from Pelosi appears to be recording with a hand-held camera. Just The News identified that woman as Pelosi’s daughter Alexandra Pelosi.\n\nIt has been publicly reported by multiple news organizations that Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker, filmed her mother during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. This isn’t unusual. Fox News reported that she has filmed her mother at the Capitol for decades.\n\nIn October 2022, Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact there wasn’t a camera crew that day — just Alexandra Pelosi with a small, hand-held camera that she always carries.\n\nThe security camera footage posted by Just The News supports Hammill’s assertion.\n\nThe clips do not prove that the events on Jan. 6, 2021, were part of a scripted plan. During years of reporting on the attack, PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that the attack was contrived.\n\nFueled partly by the false belief that the presidential election had been stolen, hundreds of people — many clad in Trump-branded apparel, others in helmets and combat gear, some armed with weapons — stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, aiming to stop the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nRioters scaled walls, broke windows, forced their way into the building and repeatedly clashed with police. One woman was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer during the attack. The siege forced lawmakers to evacuate and temporarily delayed the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nSince the attack, more than 1,000 people have faced federal charges for crimes ranging from obstruction of Congress to using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Of those, more than 580 people have pleaded guilty and 514 have been sentenced, according to an NPR analysis.\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. Capitol’s top operations and maintenance official told lawmakers that the costs of the riot — including repairs, increased security and the provision of mental health services — would exceed $30 million.\n\nFalsehoods about the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including claims that it was a false flag, were named PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year.

A House select committee has spent roughly a year and a half investigating what led to the riot and released its full report on Friday ...', 'Full_text': 'After roughly 18 months of investigations, the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has released their full report.\n\nThe document, which is more than 800 pages long, recommends the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in the attack. And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/pelosi-jan-6-capitol-riot-video/index.html', 'Headline': 'CNN Exclusive: New footage shows congressional leadership at Fort ...', 'Snippet': 'Never-before-seen footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command ...', 'Full_text': 'Never-before-seen footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command center, where they frantically coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump Cabinet members to quell the insurrection and finish certifying the 2020 election.\n\nThe January 6 select committee aired snippets of the footage at its public hearing on Thursday, but CNN has obtained roughly an hour of additional material that wasn’t presented by the panel.\n\nCongressional leaders contemplated, far more seriously than previously known, whether to reconvene the Electoral College proceedings at Fort McNair, the footage obtained by CNN reveals. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke with Pence about the “backup plan,” and officials tried to figure out how they’d transport hundreds of lawmakers to the Army base.\n\nThe extended raw footage shines a devastating light on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction during the riot. Lawmakers are seen working around Trump to secure any help they could get – from the National Guard, federal agencies and local police departments – to defeat the mob he incited.\n\nThe footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House. The filmmaker provided some of her behind-the-scenes footage to the January 6 select committee, which aired an edited compilation at Thursday’s hearing.\n\n“Everyone involved was working actively to stop the violence, to get federal law enforcement deployed to the scene to put down the violence and secure the Capitol complex,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said about the footage at the hearing. “All of them did what President Trump was not doing, what he simply refused to do.”\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe new clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nIn one dramatic scene, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer shouted at the Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, after hearing a rumor that Trump blocked the DC National Guard from rushing to the Capitol.\n\n“I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer said. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged. There is a picture of someone sitting in the chair of the Senate. We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nMcCarthy then assures Schumer that there was no stand-down order for the National Guard.\n\nAnd in another shocking moment, Schumer and Pelosi are seen chewing out the acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. In a heated phone call, Schumer told Rosen that federal authorities should “make arrests, starting now,” but Rosen only offered a halting, non-committal response.\n\n“Um, I have to defer to law enforcement on that,” Rosen replied.\n\n‘Don’t let anybody know where you are’\n\nMost of the raw footage shows Pelosi’s movements on January 6, and Alexandra Pelosi’s documentary crew provided CNN with timestamps for the videos. Perhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET. Pelosi asks Pence about his well-being and his physical safety, before discussing the possibility of resuming the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair, so lawmakers could complete the ceremonial process of finalizing Biden’s victory.\n\n“We’re at Fort McNair, which has facilities for the House and the Senate to meet, as a backup plan … should anything happen that would warrant that,” Pelosi says. “We’d rather go to the Capitol and do it there, but it doesn’t seem to be safe.”\n\nPelosi went on to tell Pence that she had been told it would take “days” for the Capitol to be secured, and thus, “we logistically want to bring all the members here, House and Senate.” But that never materialized: rank-and-file lawmakers and congressional staffers stayed inside the Capitol throughout the siege, with many barricading themselves in their offices.\n\n“I worry about you being in that Capitol room,” Pelosi tells Pence, who was holed up in a loading dock underneath the Capitol with his security detail. “Don’t let anybody know where you are.”\n\nPelosi tells the vice president that she heard reports of “defecation” on the House floor.\n\nThe House speaker says she consulted with then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about trying to “expedite” the GOP objections to President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral votes, so they could raise one objection and then “move forward” with the election certification. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, opposed the objections but several Trump-aligned GOP senators were still trying to nullify Biden’s victories in several key states.\n\nDuring the call, Pelosi unwraps a beef jerky stick and eats it, while holding the phone with her other hand.\n\n‘If he comes, I’m going to punch him out’\n\nEarlier in the previously unseen footage, on the morning of January 6, Pelosi participates in a video call with the House Democratic caucus to plan out the day’s proceedings. A devout Catholic, Pelosi invokes the Feast of the Epiphany, which is on January 6, and says she hoped that Republicans “would have their own epiphany” that day.\n\nThe call took place in Pelosi’s same conference room that was ransacked just a few hours later by riotous Trump supporters, some of whom specifically said they wanted to hunt her down.\n\nPelosi is later seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nThen, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this. But the footage backs up the testimony of Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump’s attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: “If he comes, I’m going to punch him out. I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\n‘We have got to finish the proceedings’\n\nAs Pelosi exits her office and heads to the House chamber, the footage shows congressional aides carrying the all-important boxes containing the official Electoral College certificates. The proceedings begin, with Pence presiding, and GOP lawmakers quickly file their first objection.\n\nThrongs of Trump supporters soon started swarming the Capitol complex. The shaky video footage shows Pelosi and her entourage of staff and family members getting whisked away from the building, escaping the fast-approaching rioters and descending down a narrow staircase\n\n“If they stop the proceedings, we will have totally failed,” Pelosi says, as she evacuated the Capitol, adding later, “We have got to finish the proceedings, or else they will have a complete victory.”\n\nOn her way out, she asks aides if they were able to reach McConnell, and whether he was on board to jointly request emergency assistance from the National Guard. (He was, they said.)\n\nResettled at Fort McNair, Pelosi learns that some House members were trapped in the chamber and were instructed by security officials to put on their government-issued gas masks. Pelosi and her colleagues later watch the riot unfolding on CNN, the footage shows. They were visibly shaken by the TV coverage.\n\n‘One hell of a hurry’\n\nThe extended footage obtained by CNN shows congressional leaders from both parties taking refuge at Fort McNair.\n\nDemocratic leaders Pelosi and Schumer, as well as top-ranking Reps. Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn, are seen throughout the raw footage. They were joined by top Republicans, like McConnell, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Sen John Thune of South Dakota and Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, is also in the footage, taking refuge at Fort McNair. His presence is notable considering his trajectory after the insurrection: McCarthy confronted Trump in a heated call during the attack, and directly blamed Trump in the immediate aftermath, but days later re-embraced Trump and began downplaying the riot.\n\nOne scene from the footage, around 3:18 p.m. ET, shows some of the senior Democratic officials talking again with Ryan McCarthy, the Army secretary. Schumer was apparently under the impression that the military response was impeded.\n\n“I never said no,” Ryan McCarthy says, about activating the National Guard. “I just had to get permission.” Without naming any names, Ryan McCarthy then tells the lawmakers that he “had to talk to my boss.” It’s not clear who the Army leader was referring to, but acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller was technically his boss.\n\nMiller did not speak with Trump on January 6, according to the House select committee investigating the attack. Miller did speak that day with Pence, who took on an impromptu leadership role that day, working with congressional leaders and Capitol security officials, and the footage clearly shows Pence coordinating with Pelosi about the efforts to secure the Capitol.\n\nRoughly 30 minutes later, approximately 10 lawmakers huddle around a phone in a bipartisan scrum to speak with Miller, the acting Defense secretary. Schumer presses Miller on the slow National Guard response, and informed Miller that some senators were trapped in their hideaway offices near the breached Senate chamber.\n\nMcConnell tells Miller that troops need to be “getting there in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\n“This is an emergency,” Schumer says, “where life and limb are at stake.”\n\nThe acting Pentagon chief tells the lawmakers that he got the message “loud and clear,” the troops had already been activated, and that plans to retake the Capitol were being devised by military leaders.\n\n‘Answer my question!’\n\nThe clips show Pelosi speaking with then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, about sending troops, because he could directly activate the Virginia National Guard without presidential involvement. She additionally spoke with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, another Democrat, whose police department was on the frontlines that day.\n\nThere was also the showdown with Rosen, the acting attorney general. Schumer yells into his flip phone, castigating Rosen, and urges him to tell Trump to call off the mob. Rosen had little to offer Schumer, except to say he was mobilizing federal agents under his purview. Pelosi tells Rosen that the rioters were “breaking the law … at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nRosen says his team was “coordinating as quickly and as–” before getting cut off by Schumer, who forcefully asks Rosen again if he will intervene directly with Trump.\n\n“No, no, no – please answer my question,” Schumer shouts. “Answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\n“Mr. President, you’re right that I’m not going to allow the Justice Department to do anything to try to overturn the election,” Rosen told Trump during that high-stakes Oval Office meeting on January 3, 2021, according to his testimony to the January 6 committee.\n\n‘Continue democracy here on base’\n\nAs late as 4:30 p.m. ET, top congressional leaders were talking with McCarthy, the Army secretary, about completing the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair.\n\n“We must finish,” Schumer said, “but you have to help us make that decision.”\n\nSchumer and others later discuss the logistics of shuttling hundreds of lawmakers to Fort McNair. Pelosi wonders aloud if there were microphones they could use. Officials tried to resolve the big questions: How would lawmakers get bussed from the Capitol to Fort McNair? Where would they go after certification is completed? How would they get home safely?\n\nIn what looked like an impromptu briefing, a US Capitol Police officer provides some logistical answers to the senior lawmakers, for how they could “continue democracy here on base.”\n\nBut the congressional leaders were also wary, and Schumer said the Fort McNair backup plan would look like “we’re abandoning the Capitol to insurrectionists.”\n\nBy the evening, police had expelled most of the rioters and started establishing a secure perimeter around the Capitol. Pelosi gets on the phone again with Pence around 6 p.m. ET, and the vice president had some good news for the congressional leaders, who were hoping to get back into the Capitol.\n\n“I am literally standing with the chief of the US Capitol Police,” Pence said on speakerphone, as Pelosi, Schumer and Grassley listened. “And he just informed me, that their best information is that they believe that the House and the Senate will be able to reconvene in roughly an hour.”\n\nWith that, the Fort McNair “backup plan” was called off.\n\n‘There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby’\n\nSoon after, Pelosi speaks with then-House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving. In the previously undisclosed conversation, Irving confirms that lawmakers can soon return, but some areas will be off-limits, because they are a “crime scene.”\n\n“There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby,” Irving says, referring to the area immediately off the House floor where Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a police officer.\n\nThe footage shows Pelosi leaving Fort McNair and driving through the dark streets of DC toward the Capitol. The Senate reconvened around 8 p.m. ET and the House reconvened around 9 p.m. ET.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump’s staunchest congressional allies pushed ahead with their challenges against Biden’s electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their objections, based on meritless claims of fraud, were defeated in bipartisan votes. The 2020 election formally came to a close.\n\nThe new footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, who has released documentaries on HBO for decades.

The information ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Transcripts of interviews with law enforcement officials released this week by the Jan. 6 committee reveal the panel learned that numerous security concerns had been raised in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMany of the revelations came in interviews with high-ranking individuals such as former Secret Service and White House official Anthony Ornato; former executive director of the National Capitol Threat Intelligence Center Donell Harvin; former Deputy FBI Director David Bowdich; Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee; former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund; and House Staff Director Jamie Fleet.\n\nBut some of the new information came from questions posed to those officials by Jan. 6 committee staffers based on details they had gathered in the course of the 18-month investigation.\n\nMuch of that information, mentioned by investigators during the interviews, was not included in the appendix of the committee\'s final report that addressed law enforcement and intelligence failures. For the most part, Jan. 6 committee leaders decided against focusing the final report on how law enforcement came to be so underprepared for the attack.\n\nThe new revelations add to a growing body of evidence from news reports and court proceedings that illustrate how federal law enforcement officials were in possession of ample information that indicated Jan. 6 was going to be violent. As NBC News first reported last month, staffers were informed that chapters prepared by committee staff — including material focused on law enforcement and intelligence failures — would be cut from the final version.\n\nAmong the revelations from the transcripts: One FBI employee wrote in a Dec. 26, 2020, memo about planning for Jan. 6 that was unfolding on a pro-Trump forum called TheDonald.\n\n“They think they will have a large enough group to march into DC armed, and it will outnumber the police so they can’t be stopped,"" read the notification in the eGuardian system, which is meant to help federal, state and local law enforcement officials coordinate. ""They believe that since the election was stolen, that it’s their constitutional right to over take the government and during this coup no U.S. laws apply. Another group of Proud Boys will be in DC already and are planning on blocking the roads with their cars in order to stop traffic.""\n\nNBC News previously reported that one of the FBI’s own confidential sources informed the bureau on the day that Trump sent his Dec. 19, 2020, “will be wild” tweet about Jan. 6 that far-right groups saw it as a “call to arms.” The FBI received numerous tips about the potential for violence on Jan. 6, including from the son of a Texas man who ultimately came to the Capitol with a gun, and the bureau briefed other law enforcement entities about threats, including intelligence that suggested the Oath Keepers had set up armed ""quick reaction forces"" in Virginia that were set to come into D.C. at Trump\'s command. Two members of the Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy at a trial that ended last month, and three others pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee transcripts detailed the challenges facing the FBI in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Days before the attack, the FBI lost use of the program it had been using to track threats on social media, as the bureau transitioned to a new product to gather open source information. An FBI intelligence analyst raised concerns about that on New Year\'s Eve, as threats about Jan. 6 continued to increase.\n\n“We have an urgent need for the DataMinr replacement to be on and active starting on January 4th in support of some potential issues in the D.C. area,” the analyst wrote in a Dec. 31, 2020, email. “The sudden discontinuation is most untimely as much of our crisis response funnels through DataMinr.”\n\nBowdich, in his interview with Jan. 6 investigators, said there was a lot happening at the bureau in the days before the attack: There had been a major cyber intrusion; a bomb had gone off in downtown Nashville, Tenn.; the first anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani was approaching; and the bureau was receiving a lot of intelligence about the potential for violence, much of which was publicly available on social media.\n\n“I wish you could see the volume,” Bowdich told the committee, referring to the number of threats the FBI reviews. “It is off the charts. ... One of our greatest challenges is social media today.”\n\nThe bureau did make efforts to try to disrupt extremists\' travel to D.C.; the FBI\'s Domestic Terrorism Operations Section messaged all domestic terrorism assistant special agents in charge across the country to determine whether any of the extremists they were watching were planning to go to D.C. on Jan. 6.\n\nUltimately, the FBI set up a national command post for the event inside the Strategic Information Operations Center at FBI headquarters in Washington.\n\n“The noise seemed to be growing as we got closer to the event, and it reached a point of we just didn’t know what was going to happen,"" Bowdich said. ""Sometimes you just get a sense for it when you’ve been doing it.”\n\nSome of those officials interviewed by the committee about the intelligence failures made clear they thought there were problems that needed to be fixed, both before Jan. 6 and going forward.\n\n“[Y]ou don’t need intelligence. I mean, everybody knew that people were directed to come there by the President. November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, who was head of the D.C. National Guard on Jan. 6. The information publicly available made clear that Jan. 6 “was going to be a big deal,” he said.\n\nSund, the former Capitol Police chief who resigned the day after the attack, said that intelligence he received didn\'t ""send up a bunch of red flags for me"" because most protests target Congress. Harvin, the former chief of homeland security and intelligence for D.C., told the committee that Sund shouldn\'t characterize what happened as an intelligence failure, but as a failure to act on intelligence.\n\n“He said it was intelligence failure,"" Harvin said. ""It may have been an intelligence failure on his agency’s part and a failure to properly contextualize and pervade the threat environment, but it wasn’t an intelligence failure at large.”\n\nContee, the D.C. police chief, said there needed to be better sharing of intelligence, and that he would have liked to have known about a Capitol Police report about some of the threats related to Jan. 6.\n\n“I don’t think I want to get notified about Armageddon through an email,"" Contee said. ""That would not be my preferred notification, right?”\n\nWhen asked about what she thought the intelligence failures were, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was blunt.\n\n""People didn\'t think that these white nationalists would overthrow the Capitol building,"" the Democratic mayor said.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/us/politics/jan-6-video-pelosi-schumer-capitol.html', 'Headline': 'New Jan. 6 Video Shows Pelosi and Schumer Scrambling to Secure the ...', 'Snippet': 'Chilling Footage Shows Congressional Leaders on Jan. 6.

Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/politics/new-video-clips-january-6-attack/index.html', 'Headline': 'Watch: Key moments from new footage of the January 6 Capitol attack - CNN', 'Snippet': 'House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is seen in the new footage from January 6. 2021.

The House select committee investigating ...', 'Full_text': 'CNN is airing more exclusive footage at 8 p.m. ET on “Anderson Cooper 360”.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has held a series of public hearings in an effort to shed new light on the events of that day and how former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election incited a mob of his supporters to violence.\n\nThe hearings have featured a wide array of information gathered during the investigation that has taken the form of taped clips of interviews conducted by the panel, live testimony from witnesses, and documentary materials.\n\nDuring a hearing on Thursday, which culminated in a vote to subpoena Trump, the committee showed previously unseen footage of congressional leaders on January 6 sheltering and attempting to have federal law enforcement deployed to counter the attack.\n\nCNN obtained roughly an hour of additional material that wasn’t presented by the panel. The footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command center, where they frantically coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump Cabinet members to quell the insurrection and finish certifying the 2020 election. The footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House.\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the new footage:\n\nSchumer pleads with acting AG to ask Trump to call off rioters\n\nThis clip shows a tense conversation between then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen where Schumer asks Rosen to tell Trump to tell the rioters to leave the Capitol.\n\n“Will you ask the President to make a statement to ask them to leave the Capitol?,” Schumer says. Rosen sidesteps the question, saying instead, “So, uh, as you might guess we’re coordinating as quickly and as” – at which point Schumer jumps in to say, “no, no, no, please answer my question,” before shouting, “answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\nAt the start of the clip, Schumer can be seent shouting at the then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\n“DC has requested the National Guard and it’s been denied by DOD. I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer says. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged … We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nSchumer then hangs up the phone and tells Pelosi who is sitting nearby, “They have not denied it. I spoke to the Secretary of the Army. He’s given the full OK to (inaudible) the National Guard. He said it was not denied.”\n\nPelosi talks about punching Trump\n\nPelosi can be seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nLater, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this. But the footage backs up the testimony of Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump’s attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: “If he comes, I’m going to punch him out. I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\nLater in the clip, Pelosi can be seen saying “we have got to finish the proceedings or else they will have a complete victory,” a reference to how lawmakers wanted to finish certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election and Joe Biden’s win after the pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol.\n\nPence works to relay information to Hill leaders\n\nThis clip shows Pelosi on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who says he is at the Capitol building. Pence gives Pelosi and Schumer a heads up that law enforcement officials believe the House and Senate will be able to reconvene in “roughly an hour.”\n\nThe video demonstrates how Pence worked to relay information to congressional leaders on the day of the attack. When Schumer hears what Pence has to say, he responds emphatically by saying, “Good news!”\n\n“They have thousands of law enforcement on the campus and they’re confident they can secure the campus for reconvening so, I hope that’s helpful,” Pence says. Pelosi thanks him afterward.\n\nThis clip shows in lengthy detail how the situation at the Capitol escalated on January 6 with rioters swarming the building and eventually breaching it. It shows rioters screaming obscenities directed at a variety of people including law enforcement officers, Pelosi and Pence.\n\nLater Pelosi is seen sheltering with Schumer and other congressional leaders. They pass a phone around with photos of the scene unfolding at the Capitol. “Oh my God. They broke into the Senate chamber,” Schumer says.\n\nA television is turned on showing footage of the attack. “Oh my God, they’re just breaking windows,” Pelosi says, reacting to what she sees on the screen. “It’s just horrendous. All at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nLater, a group of bipartisan congressional leaders huddle around a phone to speak with Christopher Miller, the acting Defense secretary.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has message of urgency for Miller, saying, “we’re in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\nMiller responds that he got the message, “loud and clear.”\n\nPelosi is later seen speaking with Pence on the phone. She asks him how he’s doing and expresses concern for his safety. “Don’t let anybody know where you are,” she warns.\n\nPelosi, Pence discuss personal safety, contingency plans\n\nPerhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET. Pelosi asks Pence about his well-being and his physical safety, before discussing the possibility of resuming the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair, so lawmakers could complete the ceremonial process of finalizing Biden’s victory.\n\n“I worry about you being in that Capitol room,” Pelosi tells Pence, who was holed up in a loading dock underneath the Capitol with his security detail. “Don’t let anybody know where you are.”\n\nPelosi, Schumer talk with Army secretary\n\nAs late as 4:30 p.m. ET, top congressional leaders were talking with McCarthy, the Army secretary, about completing the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair.\n\n“We must finish,” Schumer said, “but you have to help us make that decision.”\n\nSchumer and others later discuss the logistics of shuttling hundreds of lawmakers to Fort McNair. Pelosi wonders aloud if there were microphones they could use. Officials tried to resolve the big questions: How would lawmakers get bused from the Capitol to Fort McNair? Where would they go after certification is completed? How would they get home safely?\n\nBut the congressional leaders were also wary, and Schumer said the Fort McNair backup plan would look like “we’re abandoning the Capitol to insurrectionists.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/10/15/january-6-video-pelosi-schumer-capitol-security-ac360-vpx.cnn', 'Headline': 'New video shows Pelosi and Schumer talking with Army official on January 6', 'Snippet': 'New video from the January 6 insurrection shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) discussing security at the Capitol ahead of the vote to certify ...', 'Full_text': 'New video from the January 6 insurrection shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) discussing security at the Capitol ahead of the vote to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.'}}",94.64285714285714,1

Fox News host Tucker Carlson led a segment on his Aug. 4, 2022 ...', 'Full_text': 'A division of the IRS that has existed for more than a century is getting a lot of attention on social media and conservative media.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson led a segment on his Aug. 4, 2022, show by telling his audience to be worried because the government is ""treating the IRS as a military agency"" and ""stockpiling"" ammunition. He asked guest U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., ""Why would the IRS need millions of dollars worth of guns and ammo?""\n\nGaetz replied, ""Well, Joe Biden is raising taxes, disarming Americans, so of course they are arming up the IRS like they are preparing to take Fallujah.""\n\nGaetz\'s comments about Biden came after Carlson cited reports from 2018 and 2020 about IRS spending on weapons and ammunition — expenditures that happened before Biden took office. Gaetz went on to say that the IRS has also spent $731,000 this year — he didn’t say specifically on what — ""to quite literally weaponize your country against you.""\n\nIn June, Gaetz, who has co-sponsored a bill to prevent the IRS from purchasing ammunition, made a similar allegation in an interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters. Then he accused the Biden administration of suppressing access to ammunition ""for regular Americans"" while ""scooping up all of the ammo they can possibly find."" In that interview, he said the IRS spent $725,000 this year on ammunition. He also cited that figure in a June press release about his bill.\n\nA spokesperson for Gaetz did not return a request for comment regarding the grounds for his claim.\n\nHere’s what we know: The IRS did spend about $725,000 on ammunition this year. But that is not unusual, and is actually a bit less than what was spent in other recent years. These purchases are not new or unique to the Biden administration — they have been made for an IRS division that has been armed for more than a century.\n\nThe IRS buys guns and ammunition yearly for IRS Criminal Investigation, the division that has jurisdiction over federal tax crimes. The people who work there are not the typical auditors that Americans facing routine audits will encounter. The vast majority of those audits are done by mail.\n\nThe division in which agents are armed was established in 1919, when it was called the Intelligence Unit, according to the division’s 2019 report. The unit famously investigated gangster Al Capone, who was convicted on tax evasion charges. It was renamed the IRS Criminal Investigation in 1978.\n\nSpecial agents in the division investigate a number of crimes, including money laundering, cybercrime, financial fraud and narcotics-related crimes. Recently they’ve been part of a multiagency task force tracking down assets of Russian oligarchs.\n\nThe division had 2,046 special agents in 2021, a little less than the 2,159 agents it had in 2017. Those numbers haven’t changed much in five years, according to annual reports available on its website; the 2022 report has not been published.\n\nThe numbers haven’t changed much in decades. In the division’s 2017 report, then-division chief Don Fort wrote, ""We have the same number of special agents — around 2,200 — as we did 50 years ago.""\n\nSpecial agents train for weeks at the National Criminal Investigation Training Academy in Georgia, the 2021 report said. That includes firearms training and handgun qualifications for agents, which is a big reason for the large orders for ammunition.\n\nThe IRS Criminal Investigation division ordered $725,460 worth of ammunition in fiscal year 2022, according to figures provided to PolitiFact by Justin Cole, the division’s communications director. That’s slightly more than the money spent in 2021 ($655,013) and 2020 ($616,619).\n\nAccording to a 2018 report (page 75 of the PDF) to Congress by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on firearms and ammunition purchases by federal law enforcement agencies, the IRS spent about $1.1 million on ammunition in 2011 and about $1 million in 2012. From 2010 to 2017, it averaged $712,500 in ammunition spending. The report described its numbers as minimum values because agencies reported challenges compiling requested data.\n\nThe report also said the IRS had 4,461 firearms and about 5 million rounds of ammunition in stock as of November 2017. The report notes the numbers don’t include weapons or ammunition purchased for a small, separate IRS police force of fewer than a dozen officers that provides security at the Enterprise Computing Center in Martinsburg, West Virginia.\n\nThe report’s authors noted that officials at law enforcement agencies said they keep ammunition on hand to last for several months for use in training and operation, and that they order large quantities because sometimes there’s a long wait, up to a year, before the orders can be fulfilled.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office said that it does not have more recent data available.\n\nThe IRS is not the only government agency that some people may be surprised to find purchasing guns and ammunition for law enforcement officers.\n\nGaetz mentioned the Department of Agriculture, which buys weapons and ammunition for the U.S. Forest Service, and the Department of Education, which purchases them for its Office of the Inspector General. The GAO report lists several others, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAs to Gaetz’s claim that these efforts come because Biden is ""raising taxes and disarming Americans,"" there is no evidence that the IRS’ longstanding spending on weapons and ammunition is connected to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions. Biden supports a House bill to ban certain assault weapons, but that measure is not likely to pass in the Senate and, even if it did, does not amount to a plan to wholesale disarm American citizens.\n\nBiden’s plan to raise taxes targets corporations and high-earning money managers, assuming the Inflation Reduction Act passes the U.S. House. That bill may have secondary effects on average Americans that are hard to measure, experts told PolitiFact. But, even so, the routine audits the IRS performs on average Americans do not involve those armed agents who deal with criminal investigations.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGaetz claimed that the government is arming up the IRS because the president is raising taxes and disarming Americans, citing the amount of money spent on ammunition by the agency this year.\n\nBut there’s been no significant increase in spending on ammunition, and Gaetz ignores that the IRS Criminal Investigation division has existed for more than a century and that the weapons and ammunition are for those law enforcement officers. That division had fewer special agents in 2021 than it had in 2017, but the number of agents has stayed about the same for decades.\n\nThe $725,000 the division spent this year on ammunition, much of which is used for agents’ firearms training, is only slightly more than was spent in recent years and less than was spent a decade ago. There is no evidence this continued tradition of spending by the IRS has any connection to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions.\n\nWe rate this claim False.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nraila.org/articles/20230315/bidens-executive-order-targeting-gun-ownership', 'Headline': 'Biden’s Executive Order Targeting Gun Ownership - NRA-ILA', 'Snippet': 'The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as ...', 'Full_text': 'On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nMedia and gun control groups that beforehand had been salivating over the idea that the measure would impose “universal background checks” for firearm transfers had to content themselves with a vague directive for Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop a “plan” to move in that direction.\n\nAnd while the order’s other provisions were similarly vague and insubstantial, there is no doubt what it all adds up to: antagonism toward gun ownership is now the official policy of the U.S. government’s Executive Branch.\n\nThe good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done. Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them. Stay tuned to this page for details on what that looks like as the federal departments mobilize against the Second Amendment in the months ahead.

James Comer, R-Ky., chair of the House Oversight Committee, which has been investigating Biden family business dealings. The most recent memo, from Aug. 9, said the House Oversight Committee had ""identified over $20 million from foreign sources that benefitted the Biden family and their business associates.""\n\nPolitiFact analyzed this memo, along with two previously released memos.\n\nTogether, the convoluted, sometimes repetitive, maze of financial records largely supports McCarthy’s carefully phrased claim that ""$20 million in payments were directed to the Biden family members and associates."" But his word choice as he announced an impeachment inquiry into the president could give the impression that Biden family members, or even Joe Biden himself, received an equal share of the financial gains. That’s not what bank records PolitiFact has reviewed show.\n\nThe lion’s share of the $20 million went to Biden family business associates; about $5 million went to Biden family members. The records show no evidence that any payments went to Joe Biden, who was vice president when some of the payments occurred. The records also do not reveal that Joe Biden engaged in wrongdoing.\n\nMcCarthy did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.\n\nA tale of three memos: Majority of foreign payments went to Biden family ‘associates’\n\nFinancial records made public between March 16 and Aug. 9 show details of an intricate web of about $19.3 million in payments from foreign sources that were directed to the Bidens’ associates and at least three Biden family members.\n\nThe memos that detail these payments don’t provide evidence that Joe Biden took any official actions because of his family’s business dealings.\n\nThe memos show that about $14.4 million in payments were made to ""associates"" of the Biden family or accounts associated with those individuals. These payments went largely to Hunter Biden business partners: Devon Archer, James Gilliar, Vuk Jeremić and John Robinson Walker.\n\nOther Republicans have echoed this talking point, without McCarthy’s careful phrasing. On Sept. 17, former Vice President Mike Pence, who\'s running for the Republican presidential nomination, told Fox News that when Joe Biden was vice president, his ""family accepted some $20 million, which is a hard fact.""\n\nThese payments to associates originated from companies including Burisma, Bladon Enterprises, State Energy HK and, in one instance, from Yelena Baturina, a wealthy Russian whose name has also been spelled ""Elena.""\n\nBaturina wired $3.5 million to a bank account linked to Hunter Biden and Archer, according to the memos. Republicans alleged some of this money went directly to Hunter Biden, but Archer testified the money was for an unrelated real estate transaction and did not go directly to Hunter Biden.

(AP)\n\nAbout $5 million in payments went to Biden family members\n\nFrom 2014 to 2020, Biden family members received about $4.94 million from sources with ties to Ukraine, Romania, China and Kazakhstan. The memos show these payments went to:\n\nHunter Biden, the president’s son;\n\nJames Biden, the president’s brother;\n\nHallie Biden, the wife of Joe Biden’s late son Beau, who also had a relationship with Hunter after Beau’s passing;\n\nAnd an unknown account the memo characterized as a ""Biden"" account without explanation.\n\nIn many instances, payments to Biden family members were sent by wire to Robinson Walker LLC, a company owned by an associate of Hunter Biden, before they were sent to Biden family accounts.\n\nBy PolitFact’s count, about 89% of the money Biden family members received in payments — approximately $4.4 million — went to Hunter Biden or his businesses.\n\nOf the $4.4 million, Hunter Biden and companies he was linked to received:\n\n$2.6 million for his work on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nAbout $949,000 that originated from Bladon Enterprises, a company linked to Gabriel Popoviciu, according to the memos. Popoviciu is a Romanian businessman who was convicted in Romania on criminal corruption charges.\n\n$700,000 that originated from State Energy HK Ltd. and CEFC Infrastructure, two Chinese companies.\n\nAnd $142,300 that came from Kazakhstani millionaire Kenes Rakishev\'s Singapore-based company, and was used to buy Hunter Biden a sports car.\n\nA company linked to James Biden received more than $350,000 that originated with State Energy HK. Hallie Biden received two payments totaling $35,000, which the memos said originated from State Energy HK and Bladon Enterprises.\n\nSeveral payments totaling $150,000 went to the unspecified ""Biden"" account. The memos said that money originated with State Energy HK and Bladon Enterprises.\n\nFor more than four years, Republicans have been investigating the Biden family’s financial links to foreign nationals and foreign governments. Shortly after learning they had won a narrow majority in the House in the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee announced that investigating the president and his family’s business deals would be a top priority.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Ian Sams said on X, formerly Twitter, that Republicans have ""turned up no evidence of wrongdoing"" after investigating President Biden for nine months.\n\nHunter Biden remains under federal investigation for his taxes. On Sept. 14, he was indicted on one count of possession of a firearm he obtained after lying about his drug use and two counts of making false statements about his illegal drug use on a form when buying the gun.\n\nHunter Biden speaks to guests during the White House Easter Egg Roll on April 18, 2022, in Washington. (AP)\n\nWhat is a shell company?\n\nMcCarthy described the payments to Biden associates and family members as having flowed through ""shell companies.""\n\nA shell company is ""a corporate entity set-up that generally has no business operations,"" said David P. Weber, a professor in the accounting and legal studies department at Salisbury University\'s Perdue School of Business. Weber previously served as chief investigator for the Securities and Exchange Commission and as special counsel for enforcement with the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nGenerally speaking, Weber said, ""shell companies are entities formed in a jurisdiction that requires minimal documentation over who the beneficial owner is, have no active business operations or employees, and are formed for secrecy or privacy purposes.""\n\nIn the popular understanding, shell companies usually have a negative connotation, often for good reasons, experts say.\n\nSometimes, shell companies can be created for legitimate purposes, experts said. For instance, they can keep income streams separate if they are to be taxed or regulated in separate jurisdictions, said Daniel Shaviro, a taxation professor at New York University Law School. Weber said he’s seen examples in which gay couples have used shell companies to hide the joint ownership of homes in countries where LGBTQ+ couples are persecuted.\n\nMore often, though, a true ""shell company"" is a red flag for financial investigators, experts said.\n\n""Most shell companies are formed for illegitimate purposes, such as tax evasion, money laundering, other illegal activities,"" Weber said.\n\nIt’s not clear whether companies in the Hunter Biden case qualify as shell companies.\n\nIn analyzing the 21 companies cited in a GOP memo that were founded by, in partnership with, or linked to Hunter Biden, the Washington Post Fact Checker concluded that ""virtually all of the companies (many of which now are defunct) had legitimate business interests. Others had clearly identified business investments.""\n\nFor instance, the Fact Checker found entities such as separate companies founded by Hunter Biden that handled legal and lobbying work, the latter of which was disclosed as required under federal law. Rosemont Seneca Partners and several offshoots were vehicles for investments Biden and his associates made in technology, energy and entertainment ventures.\n\nA Republican memo described the Center for International Relations and Sustainable Development — a Biden family associate’s account, which received $3 million from the Chinese company State Energy HK — as ""a public policy think tank registered in Belgrade and New York.""\n\nTwo entities, Hudson West III and Hudson West IV, had an energy investment deal with CEFC China Energy. Comer has criticized this effort as ""a scheme to try to get China to buy liquefied natural gas,"" which could be viewed as a tacit acknowledgement that the companies were engaged in actual business pursuits rather than serving as shell companies.\n\n""A company that has legitimate business interests or operations is not generally considered a shell company,"" Weber said. ""It would be considered a real, operating business. Active, operating businesses with employees, physical location, or business interests"" would generally not ""fall into the definition of a shell company.""\n\nThis explains the term’s potency: It includes a clear suggestion of shadiness. But Shaviro said that if the companies do have legitimate business interests and investments, then the Republicans’ use of the term ""shell companies"" is ""inaccurate"" and ""contrary to its generally accepted meaning.""\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcCarthy said ""bank records show that nearly $20 million in payments were directed to the Biden family members and associates through various shell companies.""\n\nFinancial records released by House Republicans show a little less than $20 million in payments, but $14 million went to associates, while $5 million went to Biden family members, including Hunter.\n\nHowever, McCarthy was citing the $20 million in payments in support of an impeachment inquiry of Joe Biden, and the bank records contain neither evidence that foreign payments went to Joe Biden himself, nor evidence of wrongdoing by the president.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s not clear that the phrase ""shell companies,"" which connotes illegitimate purposes, accurately describes the corporate entities through which the money flowed. Many of the companies in question appear to have had tangible business and investment purposes, which would not fit the commonly used definition of shell companies.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

He also made a false claim about the extent of his support from environmental groups. And he used incorrect figures about the population of Africa, his own travel history and how much renewable energy Texas uses.\n\nHere is a fact check of these claims, plus a fact check on a Biden exaggeration about guns. The White House declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nGuns\n\nBeau Biden and red flag laws\n\nIn a Friday speech at the National Safer Communities Summit in Connecticut, Biden spoke of how a gun control law he signed in 2022 has provided federal funding for states to expand the use of gun control tools like “red flag” laws, which allow the courts to temporarily seize the guns of people who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. After mentioning red flag laws, Biden invoked his late son Beau Biden, who served as attorney general of Delaware, and said: “As my son was the first to enforce when he was attorney general.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. Delaware did not have a red flag law when Beau Biden was state attorney general from 2007 to 2015. The legislation that created Delaware’s red flag program was named the Beau Biden Gun Violence Prevention Act, but it was passed in 2018, three years after Beau Biden died of brain cancer. (In 2013, Beau Biden had pushed for a similar bill, but it was rejected by the state Senate.) The president has previously said, correctly, that a Delaware red flag law was named after his son.\n\nDelaware was far from the first state to enact a red flag law. Connecticut passed the first such state law in the country in 1999.\n\nStabilizing braces\n\nIn the same speech, the president spoke confusingly of his administration’s effort to make it more difficult for Americans to purchase stabilizing braces, devices that are attached to the rear of pistols, most commonly AR-15-style pistols, and make it easier to fire them one-handed.\n\n“Put a pistol on a brace, and it…turns into a gun,” Biden said. “Makes them where you can have a higher-caliber weapon – a higher-caliber bullet – coming out of that gun. It’s essentially turning it into a short-barreled rifle, which has been a weapon of choice by a number of mass shooters.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claims that a stabilizing brace turns a pistol into a gun and increases the caliber of a gun or bullet are false. A pistol is, obviously, already a gun, and “a pistol brace does not have any effect on the caliber of ammunition that a gun fires or anything about the basic functioning of the gun itself,” said Stephen Gutowski, a CNN contributor who is the founder of the gun policy and politics website The Reload.\n\nBiden’s assertion that the addition of a stabilizing brace can “essentially” turn a pistol into a short-barreled rifle is subjective; it’s the same argument his administration’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has made in support of its attempt to subject the braces to new controls. The administration’s regulatory effort is being challenged in the courts by gun rights advocates.\n\nGun manufacturers and lawsuits\n\nRepeating a claim he made in his 2022 State of the Union address and on other occasions, Biden said at a campaign fundraiser in California on Monday: “The only industry in America you can’t sue is the – is the gun manufacturers.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false, as CNN and other fact-checkers have previously noted. Gun manufacturers are not entirely exempt from being sued, nor are they the only industry with some liability protections. Notably, there are significant liability protections for vaccine manufacturers and, at present, for people and entities involved in making, distributing or administering Covid-19 countermeasures such as vaccines, tests and treatments.\n\nUnder the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, gun manufacturers cannot be held liable for the use of their products in crimes. However, gun manufacturers can still be held liable for (and thus sued for) a range of things, including negligence, breach of contract regarding the purchase of a gun or certain damages from defects in the design of a gun.\n\nIn 2019, the Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit against gun manufacturer Remington Arms Co. to continue. The plaintiffs, a survivor and the families of nine other victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, wanted to hold the company – which manufactured the semi-automatic rifle that was used in the 2012 killing – partly responsible by targeting the company’s marketing practices, another area where gun manufacturers can be held liable. In 2022, those families reached a $73 million settlement with the company and its four insurers.\n\nThere are also more recent lawsuits against gun manufacturers. For example, the parents of some of the victims and survivors of the 2022 massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, have sued over the marketing practices of the company that made the gun used by the killer. Another suit, filed by the government of Buffalo, New York, in December over gun violence in the city, alleges that the actions of several gun manufacturers and distributors have endangered public health and safety. It is unclear how those lawsuits will fare in the courts.\n\n– Holmes Lybrand contributed to this item.\n\nThe NRA and lawsuits\n\nAt a campaign fundraiser in California on Tuesday, Biden said the National Rifle Association, the prominent gun rights advocacy organization, itself cannot be sued.\n\n“And the fact that the NRA has such overwhelming power – you know, the NRA is the only outfit in the nation that we cannot sue as an institution,” Biden said. “They got – they – before this – I became president, they passed legislation saying you can’t sue them. Imagine had that been the case with tobacco companies.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. While gun manufacturers have liability protections, no law was ever passed to forbid lawsuits against the NRA. The NRA has faced a variety of lawsuits in recent years.\n\nMachine guns\n\nAt the same Tuesday fundraiser in California, Biden said that he taught the Second Amendment in law school, “And guess what? It doesn’t say that you can own any weapon you want. It says there are certain weapons that you just can’t own.” One example Biden cited was this: “You can’t own a machine gun.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim is false. The Second Amendment does not explicitly say people cannot own certain weapons – and the courts have not interpreted it to forbid machine guns. In fact, with some exceptions, people in more than two-thirds of states are allowed to own and buy fully automatic machine guns as long as those guns were legally registered and possessed prior to May 19, 1986, the day President Ronald Reagan signed a major gun law. There were more than 700,000 legally registered machine guns in the US as of May 2021, according to official federal data.\n\nFederal law imposes significant national restrictions on machine gun purchases, and the fact that there is a limited pool of pre-May 19, 1986 machine guns means that buying these guns tends to be expensive – regularly into the tens of thousands of dollars. But for Americans in most of the country, Biden’s claim that you simply “can’t” own a machine gun, period, is not true.\n\n“It’s not easy to obtain a fully automatic machine gun today, I don’t want to give that impression – but it is certainly legal. And it’s always been legal,” Gutowski said in March, when Biden previously made this claim about machine guns.\n\nCalifornia, where Biden made this remark on Tuesday, has strict laws restricting machine guns, but there is a legal process even there to apply for a state permit to possess one.\n\nThe ‘boyfriend loophole’\n\nIn the Friday speech to the National Safer Communities Summit, Biden said “we fought like hell to close the so-called boyfriend loophole” that had allowed people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence to buy and possess guns if the victim was not someone they were married to, living with or had a child with. Biden then said that now “we finally can say that those convicted of domestic violence abuse against their girlfriend or boyfriend cannot buy a firearm, period.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s categorical claim that such offenders now “cannot buy a firearm, period” is an exaggeration, though Biden did sign a law in 2022 that made significant progress in closing the “boyfriend loophole.” That 2022 law added “dating” partners to the list of misdemeanor domestic violence offenders who are generally prohibited from gun purchases – but in a concession demanded by Republicans, the law says these offenders can buy a gun five years after their first conviction or completion of their sentence, whichever comes later, if they do not reoffend in the interim.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the law’s new restriction on dating partners applies only to people who committed the domestic violence against a someone with whom they were in or “recently” had been in a “continuing” and “serious” romantic or intimate relationship. In other words, it omits people whose offense was against partners from their past or someone they dated casually.\n\nMarium Durrani, vice president of policy at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said there are “definitely some gaps” in the law, “so it’s not a blanket end-all be-all,” but she said it is “really a step in the right direction.”\n\nBiden’s endorsements from environmental organizations\n\nBiden said at a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Saturday: “Let me just say one thing very seriously. You know, I think this is the first time – and I’ve been around, as I said, a while – in history where, last week, every single environmental organization endorsed me.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that every single environmental organization had endorsed Biden. Four major environmental organizations did endorse him the week prior, the first time they had issued a joint endorsement, but other well-known environmental organizations have not yet endorsed in the presidential election.\n\nThe four groups that endorsed Biden together in mid-June were the Sierra Club, NextGen PAC, and the campaign arms of the League of Conservation Voters and the Natural Resources Defense Council. That is not a complete list of every single environmental group in the country. For example, Environmental Defense Fund, The Nature Conservancy, the National Audubon Society, Earthjustice and Greenpeace, in addition to some lesser-known groups, have not issued presidential endorsements to date.\n\nBiden’s claim of an endorsement from every environmental group comes amid frustration from some activists over his recent approvals of fossil fuel projects.\n\nThe population of Africa\n\nIn official speeches last Tuesday and last Wednesday and at a press conference the week prior, Biden claimed that Africa’s population would soon reach 1 billion. “You know, soon – soon, Africa will have 1 billion people,” he said last Wednesday.\n\nFacts First: This is false. Africa’s population exceeded 1 billion in 2009, according to United Nations figures; it is now more than 1.4 billion. Sub-Saharan Africa alone has a population of more than 1.1 billion.\n\nTexas and energy\n\nAt a campaign fundraiser in Connecticut on Friday, Biden spoke about reading recent news articles about the use of renewable energy sources in Texas. He said, “I think it’s 70% of all their energy produced by solar and wind because it is significantly cheaper. Cheaper. Cheaper.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s “70%” figure is not close to correct. The federal Energy Information Administration projected late last year that Texas would meet 37% of its electricity demand in 2023 with wind and solar power, up from 30% in 2022.\n\nTexas has indeed been a leader in renewable energy, particularly wind power, but the state is far from getting more than two-thirds of its energy from wind and solar alone. The organization that provides electricity to 90% of the state has a web page where you can see its current energy mix in real time; when we looked on Wednesday afternoon, during a heat wave, the mix included 15.8% solar, 10.2% wind and 6.6% nuclear, while 67.1% was natural gas or coal and lignite.\n\nBiden’s visits to Iraq and Afghanistan\n\nIn his Friday speech at the National Safer Communities Summit, Biden made a muddled claim about his past visits to Afghanistan and Iraq – saying that “you know, I spent a lot of time as president, and I spent 30-some times – visits – many more days in Afghanistan and Iraq.”\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim that he has visited Afghanistan and Iraq “30-some times” is false – the latest in a long-running series of exaggerations about his visits to the two countries. His presidential campaign said in 2019 that he made 21 visits to these countries, but he has since continued to put the figure in the 30s. And he has not visited either country “as president.”\n\nBiden’s travels with Xi Jinping\n\nAt another campaign fundraiser in California on Monday, Biden reprised a familiar claim about his travels with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who is, like him, a former vice president.\n\n“It wasn’t appropriate for Barack to be able to spend a lot of time getting to know him, so it was an assignment I was given. And I traveled 17,000 miles with him, usually one on one,” Biden said.\n\nFacts First: Biden’s “17,000 miles” claim remains false. Biden has not traveled anywhere close to 17,000 miles with Xi, though they have indeed spent lots of time together. This is one of Biden’s most common false claims as president, a figure he has repeated over and over in speeches despite numerous fact checks.\n\nWashington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler noted in 2021 that Biden and Xi often did not even travel parallel routes to their gatherings, let alone physically travel together. The only apparent way to get Biden’s mileage past 17,000, Kessler found, is to add the length of Biden’s flight journeys between Washington and Beijing, during which Xi was not with him.\n\nA White House official told CNN in early 2021 that Biden was adding up his “total travel back and forth” for meetings with Xi. But that is very different than traveling “with him” as Biden keeps saying, especially in the context of his boasts about how well he knows Xi. Biden has had more than enough time to make his language more precise.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-11-25/emboldened-biden-dems-push-ban-on-so-called-assault-weapons', 'Headline': 'Emboldened Biden and Democrats push to revive the assault weapons ban', 'Snippet': 'When Biden and other lawmakers talk about assault weapons, they are using an inexact term to describe a group of high-powered guns or semiautomatic long rifles, such as the AR-15, that can fire 30 ...', 'Full_text': 'When President Biden speaks about the “scourge” of gun violence, his focus returns to reviving a ban on assault weapons.\n\nHe reiterated that call this week after shootings in Colorado and Virginia: Biden wants to sign into law a renewed ban on high-powered guns that have the capacity to kill many people very quickly.\n\n“The idea we still allow semiautomatic weapons to be purchased is sick. Just sick,” Biden said on Thanksgiving Day. “I’m going to try to get rid of assault weapons.”\n\nAfter the mass killing last Saturday at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, he said in a statement: “When will we decide we’ve had enough? ... We need to enact an assault weapons ban to get weapons of war off America’s streets.”\n\nWhen Biden and other lawmakers talk about assault weapons, they are using an inexact term to describe a group of high-powered guns or semiautomatic long rifles, such as the AR-15, that can fire 30 rounds fast without reloading. By comparison, New York Police Department officers carry a handgun that shoots about half that much.\n\nA weapons ban is far off in a closely divided Congress. But Biden and the Democrats have become increasingly emboldened in pushing for stronger gun controls — and doing so with no clear electoral consequences.\n\nThe Democratic-led House passed legislation in July to revive a 1990s-era ban on assault weapons, with Biden’s vocal support. And the president pushed a ban nearly everywhere that he campaigned this year.\n\nIn the midterm elections, Democrats kept control of the Senate and Republicans were able to claim a House majority by a narrower margin than they had expected.\n\nThe tough talk follows passage in June of a landmark bipartisan bill on gun laws, and it reflects steady progress that gun control advocates have been making in recent years.\n\n“I think the American public has been waiting for this message,” said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been the Senate’s leading advocate for stronger gun restrictions since the massacre of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. “There has been a thirst from voters, especially swing voters, young voters, parents, to hear candidates talk about gun violence, and I think Democrats are finally sort of catching up with where the public has been.”\n\nJust over half of voters want to see nationwide gun policy made more strict, according to AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of more than 94,000 voters nationwide conducted for the Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago. About 3 in 10 want gun policy kept as is, and 14% prefer looser gun laws.\n\nThere are clear partisan divides. About 9 in 10 Democrats want stricter gun laws, compared with about 3 in 10 Republicans. About half of Republicans want gun laws left as they are, and one-quarter want to see gun laws be made less strict.\n\nOnce banned in the United States, the high-powered firearms are now the weapon of choice among young men responsible for many of the most devastating mass shootings. Congress allowed the restrictions put in place in 1994 on the manufacture and sales of the weapons to expire a decade later, unable to muster the political support to counter the powerful gun lobby and reinstate the weapons ban.\n\nWhen he was governor of Florida, current Republican Sen. Rick Scott signed gun control laws in the wake of mass shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. But he has consistently opposed weapons bans, arguing like many of his Republican colleagues that most gun owners use them lawfully.\n\n“People are doing the right thing; why would we take away their weapons?” Scott asked as the Senate was negotiating gun legislation last summer. “It doesn’t make any sense.”\n\nHe said more mental health counseling, assessments of troubled students and law enforcement on campus make more sense.\n\n“Let’s focus on things that actually would change something,” Scott said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have long called for stricter gun laws, arguing that the availability of these weapons makes people less safe and makes their jobs more dangerous.\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore, who heads the country’s third-largest police department, said it just makes sense to talk about restricting firearms when gun violence is rising nationwide, and consider what the government can do to make the streets safer. He said he is grateful Biden is bringing it up so much.\n\n“This isn’t a one-and-done,” Moore said of the shooting last weekend at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo. “These things are evolving all the time, in other cities, at any moment another incident happens. It’s crying out for the federal government, for our legislators, to go out and make this change,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, six people were shot dead at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Va. Over the last six months there has been a supermarket shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., a massacre of school children in Uvalde, Texas, and the Fourth of July parade killing of revelers in Highland Park, Ill.\n\nThe legislation that Biden signed in June will, among other things, help states put in place “red flag” laws that make it easier for authorities to take weapons from people judged to be dangerous.\n\nBut a ban was never on the table.\n\nA 60-vote threshold in the Senate means some Republicans must be on board. Most are steadfastly opposed, arguing it would be too complicated, especially as sales and varieties of firearms have proliferated. There are many more types of these high-powered guns today than in 1994, when the ban was signed into law by President Clinton.\n\n“I’d rather not try to define a whole group of guns as being no longer available to the American public,” Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said. “For those of us who have grown up with guns as part of our culture, and we use them as tools — there’s millions of us, there’s hundreds of millions of us — that use them lawfully.”\n\nIn many states where the bans have been enacted, the restrictions are being challenged in court, gaining strength from a Supreme Court ruling in June expanding gun rights.\n\n“We feel pretty confident, even despite the arguments made by the other side, that history and tradition as well as the text of the 2nd Amendment are on our side,” said David Warrington, chairman and general counsel for the National Foundation for Gun Rights.\n\nBiden was instrumental in helping secure the 1990s ban as a senator. The White House has noted statistics showing that while it was in place, mass shootings declined, and when it expired in 2004, shootings tripled.\n\nThe reality is complicated. The data on the effectiveness is mixed and there is a sense that other measures that are not as politically fraught might actually be more effective, said Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York-Cortland and author of “The Politics of Gun Control.”\n\nPolitically, the ban sparked a backlash, even though the final law was a compromise version of the initial bill, he said.\n\n“The gun community was furious,” Spitzer said.\n\nThe ban has been blamed in some circles for the Democrats losing control of Congress in 1994, though subsequent research has shown that the loss was probably more about strong, well-funded conservative candidates and district boundaries, Spitzer said.\n\nStill, after Democrat Al Gore, who supported stricter gun laws, lost the 2000 White House race to Republican George W. Bush, Democrats largely backed off the issue until the Sandy Hook shooting a decade ago. Even after that, it was not a campaign topic until the 2018 midterms.\n\nNow, gun control advocates see progress.\n\n“The fact that the American people elected a president who has long been a vocal and steadfast supporter of bold gun safety laws — and recently reelected a gun-sense majority to the Senate — says everything you need to know about how dramatically the politics on this issue have shifted,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2022/01/31/atf-keeping-database-of-nearly-1-billion-records-of-gun-sales-n55008', 'Headline': 'ATF keeping database of nearly 1-billion records of gun sales', 'Snippet': 'Rep.

That nugget about last year’s input was originally leaked to Gun Owners of America, according to 2A activist and writer John Crump, who adds that gun rights activists are especially concerned because of a recent push by the ATF to have FFL’s store their finished 4473 forms digitally.\n\nThe ATF has removed the time limit that the FFLs are required to keep the documents on-site, meaning the FFLs can never get rid of a form 4473 once it gets entered into their system except when turning the records over to the ATF. If an FFL turned over the records, then that would mean that those files would become part of the 920 million records currently held by the ATF.\n\nWhile the ATF maintains that the database is used to help trace firearms that are recovered, some Republicans on Capitol Hill are concerned about the massive collection of information.\n\nRep. Michael Cloud (R., Texas), who led an investigation into the ATF database following a November Free Beacon report that the Biden administration had stockpiled records of more than 54 million gun transactions in 2021, expressed shock at the number of gun records being kept by the federal government. Cloud maintains that the ATF’s database could be exploited by the Biden administration to surveil American gun owners as it pursues new restrictions on firearms.\n\n“A federal firearm registry is explicitly banned by law. Yet, the Biden administration is again circumventing Congress and enabling the notably corrupt ATF to manage a database of nearly a billion gun transfer records,” Cloud told the Free Beacon. “Under the president’s watch, the ATF has increased surveillance on American gun owners at an abhorrent level. The Biden administration continues to empower criminals and foreign nationals while threatening the rights of law-abiding Americans. It’s shameful and this administration should reconsider its continued attacks on American gun owners.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Free Beacon, the ATF says it has already fully digitized more than 850-million firearms transaction records. While the ATF has long had access to paper copies of the records, including those stored on-site at FFLs, the database itself is a more recent development, and one that some 2A groups are taking seriously.\n\nAidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, an advocacy group that has closely tracked the ATF’s database, told the Free Beacon that it is becoming clear the Biden administration is on its way to creating a national gun registry.\n\n“Make no mistake—this is clear evidence that a partial national gun registry exists,” Johnston said. “If the American people don’t stand up for their rights now, Biden’s anti-gun ATF will be able to track gun owners, infringe on our rights, and potentially even confiscate our firearms.”\n\nIs this a true gun registry? Not really, but if it doesn’t already violate existing law it dances close to the edge of legality. The database can’t track private firearm sales, for instance, which is one reason why gun control activists continue to push to criminalize the activity and why many gun owners are so insistent that it’s none of the government’s business what they do with the guns that are their own private property.\n\nHome-built guns are also not going to be a part of this database, though the Biden administration is making moves there as well. The ATF is currently finalizing a proposed rule that would require even unfinished gun parts to be serialized and treated as a working firearm under federal law before they could be sold to consumers, though the proposal is going to have a difficult time catching up to the reality that a solid block of aluminum can be turned into a working receiver in just a matter of hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI agree with Johnson of the GOA that the American people need to take this seriously. I would just add that while that absolutely includes contacting your representative and senator and urging them to curb this attempt by the Biden administration to create a backdoor gun registry, it also means opposing tools that can be used to establish an illegal gun registry, like universal background checks. Further, it means supporting efforts to make it easier for responsible Americans to exercise their Second Amendment rights without having to first get permission from their local, state, or federal governments.\n\nThe ATF has long been able to use the de-centralized firearms transaction records to trace individual firearms if needed, and personally, I think the risks of establishing a centralized and computerized database far outweigh the benefit to law enforcement. I’m not unsympathetic to the argument that a computerized database can dramatically speed up that process, but that doesn’t change the fact that the ATF is in essence doing what Congress has specifically said is not allowed. I just hope that if Republicans do take back the House (and potentially the Senate as well) come November this doesn’t suddenly and inexplicably become an issue that can be left on the back burner. There was a case to be made for serious ATF reform even before the Biden administration decided to turn it into a political vehicle for his gun control agenda, but the need has become even more acute since, and it should be a top priority for the GOP if they take charge of Congress on Election Day.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/06/qa-on-bidens-gun-proposals/', 'Headline': ""Q&A on Biden's Gun Proposals - FactCheck.org"", 'Snippet': 'Over that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.', 'Full_text': 'In a prime-time speech to the nation, President Joe Biden spoke about gun violence and his proposals to reduce it. Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Ghost guns Biden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes.

A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.'}}",91.5625,1

There, the President reiterated his view that Xi is a “dictator,” after being asked by a reporter whether he stood by a comment saying as much this past June.\n\nAt that point, Beijing reacted with vitriol, with the remark seen as casting a shadow over tentative progress in advancing dialogue between the two sides following a visit from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nWhen asked about Biden’s latest comment at a Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday, a spokesperson called it “extremely erroneous” and an “irresponsible political maneuver, which China firmly opposes.”\n\n“What needs to be pointed out is that there will always be some people with ulterior motives attempting to undermine China-US relations. They will not succeed in doing so,” spokesperson Mao Ning said.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether there will be any further reaction this time, but the response comes as China’s signaling around the San Francisco Bay Area meeting between Xi and Biden has marked a shift away from its hardline position on the United States. This softening comes as China grapples with a troubled economy and is keen to highlight Xi as a powerful and capable world leader.\n\nAccording to statements from both the US and China Wednesday, the two sides agreed to restore military communications and to combat the flow of fentanyl from China to the US during several hours of “constructive” meetings.\n\nChina labeled the talks as “positive” and “comprehensive” — while also highlighting Xi’s efforts to spell out Beijing’s non-negotiables such as its position on Taiwan and perceived American efforts to contain China’s rise.\n\nXi’s optics\n\nOn Chinese state media and across social media platforms, where the hashtag #Planet-Earth-Is-Big-Enough-For-Both-China-And-The-US was trending, the broad perception appeared to be of a job well done.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV highlighted how Biden invited Xi for a walk around the leafy estate where the meeting took place and that the American leader “personally escorted him to his car to bid goodbye” — a detail that was also highlighted in another top-trending hashtag on Chinese social media.\n\nThe positive coverage of the event was a break from the typical rhetoric critical of the US that often plays across Chinese state and social media. Anti-US rhetoric has been a significant theme boosting growth in Chinese nationalism as tensions flared between the two in recent years.\n\nThe optics of a warm welcome and the display of a commanding presence next to Biden are critically important for Xi, who analysts say was not only keen to stabilize a complicated relationship at a time of economic weakness, but also to present himself to his domestic audience as skillfully helming China’s foreign affairs.\n\nXi’s visit came as the Chinese economy struggles with a property market crisis, high local government debt and record youth unemployment. At the same time, crackdowns across several sectors have pummeled business confidence and led many to question what opportunities remained in China.\n\n“These challenges are tremendous,” said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, who noted that in California, Xi wanted to show viewers back home his “leadership capacity in the foreign affairs arena” and that he is highly regarded in America and a world leader on par with Biden.\n\nA press conference with China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi in California following the bilateral meeting also underscored some of those optics.\n\nWang noted that Biden sent a “separate invitation to President Xi Jinping specifically to hold a heads of state meeting,” unlike other bilateral meeting arrangements happening during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum that Xi and other leaders from across the Pacific are in town to attend.\n\n“(The Xi-Biden meeting) is sure to become a milestone … and a major event in today’s international relations,” Wang said, pointing out that the four-hour face-to-face talks were held “amidst the backdrop of a critical stage in China-US relations.”\n\nXi also took a conciliatory tone speaking at a dinner event in front of American CEOs later that day.\n\nHe told the audience the most fundamental question shaping US-China relations is whether they are rivals or partners.\n\n“If we regard each other as the biggest rival, the most significant geopolitical challenge and an ever-pressing threat, it will inevitably lead to wrong policies, wrong actions and wrong results,” Xi told an audience that included Apple CEO Tim Cook and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\n“China is willing to be a partner and friend of the United States,” he added.\n\n‘Bottom lines’\n\nWhile it helped to advance dialogue and cooperation, the meeting was also a chance for both sides to highlight their differences — and showed areas where they did not reach consensus, which analysts say will continue to define their contentious relationship.\n\nAnd even within areas where they two sides did come to agreement, there remains fragile ground.\n\nChina’s announcement of the restoration of military communications, which the Biden administration had long pushed for, said those would resume “on the basis of equality and respect.”\n\n“What that means is in the future anytime China is annoyed with anything the US does, China can say it’s cutting off military-to-military dialogues again and blame it on the US (for) no longer making China feel ‘respected,’” said Wen-Ti Sung, a Taiwan-based fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub.\n\n“(This) undermines the basis of the talks’ resumption and existence,” he added.\n\nOn Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy that China’s ruling Communist Party claims, Xi urged the US to stop arming the island and to support China’s “peaceful reunification,” according to China’s readout of the meeting released by state media.\n\n“China will eventually achieve reunification, and will inevitably achieve reunification,” Xi was quoted as saying — another line that was also trending on Chinese social media following the meeting.\n\nBiden, for his part, reaffirmed the long-standing American position on Taiwan and its opposition to any unilateral changes to the status quo, saying cross-strait differences must be “resolved by peaceful means,” according to a readout from the White House.\n\nXi also called on the US to “not scheme to suppress or contain China,” in an apparent reference to America’s strengthening of its alliances in Asia and what Beijing sees as efforts to stymie its economic development with trade and investment restrictions on high tech. Washington says those curbs are intended to protect its national security against an assertive and authoritarian China.\n\n“Both sides should understand each other’s principles and bottom lines,” Xi added.\n\nThe deep concerns each has about the other’s intentions are unlikely to be soothed after one meeting. How those agreements are executed in the weeks and months to come say much about whether China and the US are both committed to lasting stability.\n\n“The meeting indicates that the US-China relationship is not going to further worsen in the next year, but will it rebound very quickly and become significantly warmer very soon? I would say no,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor focusing on Chinese politics at City University of Hong Kong.\n\n“Of course, Xi Jinping wants better US-China relations, but (Beijing) realizes … the fundamental fact (is) that the US wants to contain China, so their expectation is that warmer relations are good, but as long as they don’t get worse, they can accept that,” he said.\n\nOne immediate indicator of how relations will progress may be seen in any further response from Beijing to Biden’s “dictator” comment, and whether its state media and social media platforms continue gloss over the comment to focus on the positive outcomes from Wednesday.\n\nBiden himself seems to indicate hope that the two can work through their differences as he noted that “(Xi) is a dictator in the sense that he is a guy who runs a country that is communist” and that the Chinese government “is totally different than ours.”\n\n“Anyway,” he added. “We made progress.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-calls-chinese-president-xi-dictator-2023-06-21/', 'Headline': ""China hits back after Biden calls Xi a 'dictator' - reuters.com"", 'Snippet': 'China hit back on Wednesday after U.S. President Joe Biden referred to President Xi Jinping as a ""dictator"", saying the remarks were absurd and a provocation, an unexpected flare-up following ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/4cb89f5a-fb08-403d-892b-0c8e496926e8', 'Headline': 'China hits out at US after Joe Biden calls Xi Jinping a ‘dictator’', 'Snippet': 'Unlock the White House Watch newsletter for free.

And while some US officials expressed surprise after reading the president’s quotes, there was little to indicate he misspoke while detailing his view of the spy balloon incident earlier this year that temporarily caused a pause in US-China relations.\n\n“The reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two boxcars full of spy equipment in it is he didn’t know it was there,” Biden told Democratic donors underneath a white tent in a backyard in Marin County. “No, I’m serious. That’s what’s a great embarrassment for dictators, when they didn’t know what happened.”\n\nBiden’s assessment that President Xi Jinping had been in the dark about the balloon accurately reflects US intelligence about the episode, one person familiar with the matter said. But revealing that information in public – as Biden has done twice now over the past few days – caught some officials off guard since it had previously only been the private assessment of the situation.\n\n“He didn’t know about it,” Biden told donors. “When it got shot down he was very embarrassed and he denied it was even there.”\n\nAnother senior administration official said Biden’s candor on China was hardly shocking.\n\n“It should come as no surprise that the president speaks candidly about China and the differences that we have – we are certainly not alone in that,” the senior administration official said.\n\nPerhaps more surprising than the content of Biden’s remarks, however, was their timing. Biden was speaking at a fragile moment for US-China ties, days after a high-profile diplomatic visit to Beijing by the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared to yield a pause in the enmity. Describing Xi as “very embarrassed” and out of touch may act counter to those efforts.\n\nDuring his visit, Blinken met for just over half-an-hour with Xi in what was later described as a “constructive” conversation.\n\nBlinken hasn’t yet returned to Washington to brief Biden in-person on his visit, though White House officials said that was planned as soon as he’s back. Washington’s top diplomat said Monday that the US and China had made “progress” toward bringing relations back on track with both sides agreeing on the need to “stabilize” their bilateral relationship.\n\nThe senior administration official expressed confidence Biden’s comments would not upend US diplomatic efforts with China, asserting “every expectation of building on” the progress Blinken made during his recent visit to Beijing.\n\n“The president believes that diplomacy, including that undertaken by Secretary Blinken, is the responsible way to manage tensions. Secretary Blinken had a good trip and made some progress. We have every expectation of building on that progress,” the official said.\n\nElsewhere in his remarks Tuesday, Biden praised Blinken’s work to repair the relationship by reiterating he “did a good job” and adding that improving the relationship would “take time.” At a second fundraiser Tuesday, Biden told donors that US climate envoy John Kerry would also hopefully be making a trip to China “pretty soon” with a focus on the environment.\n\nBiden himself told reporters over the weekend he hoped to meet Xi in the coming months, believing high-level engagement is the only way to prevent the relationship from spiraling into conflict. After his comment, some officials said it was too soon to say whether the fundraiser remarks would cause another breakdown in relations.\n\n“That’s up to China,” one official said.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it was too early to speculate whether such a meeting could occur on the sidelines of this year’s Group of 20 summit in India, scheduled for September. Biden and Xi last met at a G20 conference in Bali.\n\nThe two presidents could also arrange a meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit Biden is hosting in November in San Francisco. Xi last visited the United States in 2017 for talks with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said he didn’t have any time or dates for a Biden-Xi meeting: “I don’t have anything to speak to with respect to the next discussion slash meeting with President Xi,” he said.\n\nCiting Biden’s comments about a potential meeting in the coming months, Kirby said, “That will happen and it’ll happen at the appropriate time.”\n\n“Whether it happens at the G20 this year or not, I simply don’t know and wouldn’t speak to this early on,” he went on.\n\nBiden details tension with China\n\nThe president on Tuesday went into additional detail on some of the ongoing tension between the two superpowers. He said that while China’s leader was “embarrassed” about the balloon incident, what “he was really upset about” was Biden’s efforts since taking office to bring the leaders of the Quad – the United States, India, Australia and Japan – closer together to serve as a counterweight to a more assertive China.\n\n“He called me and told me not to do that because it was putting him in a bind,” Biden said, referring to the Chinese president. “We’re just trying to make sure the international rules of air and sea lanes remain open.”\n\nAt least in the near term, Biden’s remark prompted China’s friends to demonstrate their allegiances.\n\n“These are very contradictory manifestations of US foreign policy, which, on the one hand, reflect its unpredictability, [and] on the other hand, a continuation of the US mentoring policy,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his regular press briefing.\n\nPeskov said that Russia has “its own very bad relations” with the US, while it had “very good relations” with China.\n\nBiden’s comments Tuesday likening Xi to “dictators” marked the latest example of a president who often speaks more freely when cameras are off at fundraisers, including offering more candid musings about other world leaders and foreign affairs.\n\nThe president issued a chilling warning to Democratic donors in New York City last year when he mused about the threat of nuclear “Armageddon” amid concerns Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threats - comments that went beyond how other US officials had spoken about the matter.\n\nIn another fundraiser last fall, the president used Italy’s election of a far right leader to warn Democrats not to be “sanguine about what’s happening here” heading into the midterm elections.\n\n“You just saw what’s happened in Italy in that election,” Biden told the donors and Democratic officials at a Washington, DC, fundraiser. “You’re seeing what’s happening around the world. And the reason I bother to say that is we can’t be sanguine about what’s happening here either. I don’t want to exaggerate it, but I don’t want to understate it.”\n\nAnd on at least one occasion, he disclosed details of a private conversation with a world leader during a fundraiser, revealing that French President Emmanuel Macron was the leader who asked him how long America is “back” for at a G7 summit on the Cornish coast in England.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2023/11/16/exp-biden-xi-steven-jiang-reports-111612aseg1-cnni-world.cnn', 'Headline': 'CNN reporter breaks down reactions to Biden-Xi meeting', 'Snippet': ""CNN's Beijing Bureau Chief, Steven Jiang, reports from the Chinese capital with reaction to the Biden-Xi meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit. 03:49 - Source: CNN.

Explicitly saying so, however, could make the immediate US goal ...', 'Full_text': 'Over the past week, US President Joe Biden has made a series of unscripted remarks that have upped the temperature of US-Russia relations to near boiling point.\n\nHowever, his ad-libbed line at the end of what was billed as a ""major speech"" in Poland on Saturday - seemingly calling for President Vladimir Putin to be removed from power - may have landed the hardest.\n\nIn his speech to a crowd of assembled Polish government officials and dignitaries at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, the US president once again warned that the world was in the midst of an era-defining conflict between democracies and autocracies.\n\nHe pledged that Nato would defend ""every inch"" of its member states\' soil. He also promised continued support to Ukraine, although he noted that the US military would not engage with Russian forces there.\n\nIt was a confrontational, but measured, speech - well in line with what US officials, from Secretary of State Antony Blinken on down, have been saying for months.\n\nThen, right before the ""thank yous"" and ""goodbyes"", Mr Biden added of his Russian counterpart: ""For God\'s sake, this man cannot remain in power.""\n\nCue the fireworks.\n\n""This speech - and the passages which concern Russia - is astounding, to use polite words,"" Russia spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. ""He doesn\'t understand that the world is not limited to the United States and most of Europe.""\n\nAnd the US walk-backs.\n\n""The president\'s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region,"" a Biden administration official said on background. ""He was not discussing Putin\'s power in Russia, or regime change.""\n\nThe speed with which the US issued its ""clarification"" - later echoed by Mr Blinken - suggests the US understands the danger inherent in Mr Biden\'s words.\n\nEarlier in the day, the US president had called Mr Putin a ""butcher"". Last week, he seemed to get ahead of his own administration\'s diplomatic process by accusing the Russian leader of war crimes. In both cases, Mr Biden\'s remarks prompted condemnations and warnings from Moscow that US-Russia diplomatic relations were being frayed to the point of breaking.\n\nThere\'s a line between condemning a nation\'s leader - the sometimes overheated rhetoric of diplomacy - and calling for his removal. It was a line both the Americans and the Soviets respected even at the height of the Cold War. And it is a line that Mr Biden had apparently crossed.\n\n""Regime change"" is something powerful countries are accused of imposing on weaker ones - not what one nuclear-armed nation demands of another.\n\nBy Sunday, even some US allies were attempting to distance themselves from Mr Biden\'s remarks.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron warned that the US president was putting ceasefire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in jeopardy.\n\n""We want to stop the war that Russia has launched in Ukraine without escalation,"" he said. ""If this is what we want to do, we should not escalate things - neither with words or actions.""\n\nIn Washington, congressional leaders were also expressing concern. Idaho Republican Jim Risch, the senior Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee, called Mr Biden\'s remarks a ""horrendous gaffe"".\n\n""My gosh, I wish they would keep him on script,"" he said. ""Any time you say or even, as he did, suggest that the policy was regime change, it\'s going to cause a huge problem. This administration has done everything they can to stop escalating. There\'s not a whole lot more you can do to escalate than to call for regime change.""\n\nMr Biden has a well-known propensity for making off-the-cuff remarks that can land him in difficult situations. They\'ve derailed past presidential bids and occasionally frustrated Obama administration officials when he was vice-president. Those lines are not entirely accidental, however. They can reveal where Mr Biden\'s heart lies, even if his head - and the heads of those around him - might prefer he hold his tongue.\n\nThat, at times, is a political strength, writes The Atlantic\'s Tom Nichols, allowing Mr Biden to authentically connect with the emotions of the American people. But, in this current moment of diplomatic crisis - when poorly chosen words can lead to consequential actions - they\'re also a weakness.\n\n""It is hard to blame Biden for giving in to his famous temper after talking to the people who have suffered from Putin\'s barbarism,"" Mr Nichols writes. ""But the words of every world leader matter right now, and none more than those of the president of the United States.""\n\nMr Biden may believe that US-Russia relations are damaged to the point that they will not be repaired while Mr Putin is in power. Explicitly saying so, however, could make the immediate US goal - ending the war in Ukraine while preserving the nation\'s territorial integrity - more difficult.\n\nThe war in Ukraine is not going the way Mr Putin intended so far. His army is bogged down in bitter fighting and casualties are growing. His economy is straining under the weight of economic sanctions. Russia is increasingly isolated from the rest of the world.\n\nThe situation has potential to lead to the de-escalation the US and its allies are calling for - but it also could make Mr Putin more desperate. And if the Russian leader believes his power is at stake, and believes the US is not-so-secretly making that an objective of its efforts, the turn the crisis takes from here may not be one toward peace.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65969802', 'Headline': 'US-China tensions: Biden calls Xi a dictator a day after Beijing ... - BBC', 'Snippet': 'US President Joe Biden has called Chinese President Xi Jinping a dictator at a fundraising event in California.

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

However, what is making waves is a whistleblower named Brook Jackson. She claims that in September 2020, when she was hired to oversee the testing of a COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer, criminal fraud occurred, allowing the vaccine to be FDA-approved.\n\nThe questions which have been asked the most since these allegations became public are:\n\nWhat criminal fraud was committed?\n\nIs there anything mentioned in the lawsuit that could be deemed criminal fraud?\n\nAre there holes in Ms. Jackson's claims?\n\nWhile there are issues with mishandling biohazard materials during the testing process, is that enough to constitute a data integrity breach?\n\nYou might find the issues brought up by Professor Dorit Rubenstein Reiss of the University of California Hastings College of Law quite interesting. Do you think that Reiss has created massive holes in the claims stated by Ms. Jackson? As far as we can tell, Jackson or her legal team has not addressed these holes. You can read them here.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that just because Jackson or her legal team has not addressed the holes does not mean they are legit.\n\nOthers have wondered why Ms. Jackson went to BMJ.com to break the story, a UK company instead of one in the US. Was no media outlet willing to break the story because they felt it lacked objective evidence?\n\nHow much does it pay to sue Big Pharma? A lot. If the government intervenes, the relator (the official designation of the whistleblower) can expect 15-25% of the amount the government recovers. The highest recorded payout to a whistleblower is $32 million. And if the government agrees with Jackson, her payout could be substantially more.\n\nThe Key Players\n\nPfizer Inc. - is the manufacturer of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. On August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the vaccine as safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 for individuals 12 or older. The vaccine is currently marketed under the name Comirnaty. The FDA ruled no problem with the data submitted, and no criminal fraud was committed.\n\nVentavia Research Group (VRG) - The independent lab tested the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. According to their website, they have eight locations in Texas: Houston, Fort Worth, Plano, Arlington, Keller, Burleson, Weatherford, and Grapevine. They have just under 100 employees and have performed clinical trial research since 2013.\n\nThe FDA has not taken any action against Ventavia and fully accepted the data from the vaccine testing performed at Ventavia facilities. Wouldn't it make sense if there was an actual problem that the FDA would have taken action? But they didn't.\n\nBrook Jackson - Known as The COVID-19 Pfizer Whistleblower who reported her findings to the FDA on September 25, 2020. Jackson states she has audio recordings and copies of company documents backing up her claims about how VRG conducted the vaccine trial.\n\nOne photo allegedly shows needles used in the vaccine trial had been discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of the approved sharps container box. It is unclear if the used needles were poking through the plastic bag creating a potential injury to anyone handling the bag or near it. Another photo shows the potential of unblinding the participants as the completed vaccine packing materials contained the trial participants' identification numbers, which were out in the open instead of in a secured location.\n\nDoes this sound like criminal fraud to you? Does it paint a picture of a lack of training? Yes. How about that when overworked employees often make mistakes they wouldn't under normal circumstances? That would be probable.\n\nPaul Thacker - the reporter responsible for breaking the story, is described as an American journalist who has reported on science, medicine, and the environment. He has just 16k followers on Twitter. Does that seem like a lot to you? And according to Science.org, fake news is shared 70% more often on Twitter than real news.""}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-10-24/no-anti-vaxxers-this-flawed-and-retracted-study-of-vaccine-deaths-hasnt-been-reinstated', 'Headline': 'Column: Why anti-vaxxers are pretending a flawed study on vaccine ...', 'Snippet': 'Single-dose vials of Pfizer’s updated COVID-19 vaccine booster. Anti-vaccine agitators are still spreading unscientific propaganda, but the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective.', 'Full_text': 'Over the weekend, as I pondered a volume of forgotten lore — it was Emily Wilson’s gripping translation of Homer’s “Odyssey,” actually — my email inbox started filling up with the curious news that a long-discredited and retracted paper claiming that the COVID vaccines had killed nearly 300,000 Americans had been “reinstated.”\n\nIt did not take long to determine that the truth was, no, not really. But the sudden appearance of this claim and its rapid spread across the anti-vaccine ecosystem speak volumes about how “bad papers written by antivax ideologues designed to promote a narrative that vaccines are dangerous and/or ineffective ... never die,” to quote the veteran pseudoscience debunker David Gorski.\n\n“Junk science can often find a home somewhere in the bowels of the literature, but that doesn’t stop it being junk science,” says John P. Moore, professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, whose experience fighting anti-science quackery dates to the AIDS epidemic of the 1990s.\n\nIn this case, the assertion that a retracted paper by Michigan State University economist Mark Skidmore has been resurrected in the peer-reviewed literature is based on “one possibly accurate piece of information, a lie, and a half-truth,” Gorski observes.\n\nLet’s take a look.\n\nI wrote about Skidmore’s paper in April, when it was retracted by its original publisher, the respectable medical journal BMC Infectious Diseases.\n\nPublished in January, the paper had started out as a sort of sociological study of what factors might lead people to be more or less amenable to taking a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nBased on an anonymous database of 2,840 respondents compiled by a third-party survey firm, Skidmore reported that people who knew someone who had a serious bout of COVID illness were more likely to get vaccinated, while knowing someone who appeared to have suffered a post-vaccination injury made them less likely to take the shot.\n\nThat was not especially surprising. But Skidmore proceeded to extrapolate from the number of respondents who said they knew someone who had died from the vaccine to conclude that the number of U.S. vaccine-related deaths “may be as high as 278,000.”\n\nThat claim was taken as gospel truth by the anti-vaccine movement, which helped make the paper one of the most-viewed papers in the journal’s history.\n\nBut there was a problem. Skidmore based his estimate of vaccine-related deaths on the opinions of people who had no way of knowing that the illness or death their acquaintances suffered after vaccination had anything to do with the shot.\n\nAnother red flag was that he relied on the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, or VAERS, as a benchmark database for COVID vaccine injuries.\n\nVAERS is maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which warns explicitly that it’s not suitable for that purpose. That’s because it’s a repository of entirely voluntary reports that can be filed by anyone, including but not limited to doctors, patients and family members, who aren’t required to document the injury.\n\n“VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event,” the CDC says. “A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event.”\n\nWhen serious vaccine scientists see VAERS treated in a paper as an authoritative source for injury estimates, they take it as a sign that the paper is sloppy or even willfully dishonest. As it happens, VAERS is a popular source for anti-vaccine claims of all sorts, especially about the COVID shots.\n\nAs I observed before, there are few fields in which flawed scientific research has been weaponized as much as in studies of COVID treatments. Worthless nostrums such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin have been promoted as COVID treatments based on transparently bogus evidence.\n\nSkidmore disagreed with BMC’s retraction notice in April, and still does. He maintains that BMC’s retraction violated professional standards, although one rule he cited is that a journal has “clear evidence that the findings are unreliable.”\n\nYet BMC’s retraction notice cited “concerns ... regarding the validity of the conclusions drawn after publication.” It said Skidmore’s methodology in estimating vaccine deaths “was inappropriate as it does not prove causal inference of mortality. ... Furthermore, there was no attempt to validate reported fatalities.”\n\n“My article is one piece of evidence among many that the COVID-19 vaccines have resulted in injury and death,” Skidmore told me by email.\n\nThat’s what lawyers might call “assuming facts not in evidence.” For there is no “evidence” in Skidmore’s paper that the vaccines have resulted in injury and death to any degree that would make them more dangerous than contracting COVID-19 — just unsupported conjectures by acquaintances of people who died at some point after getting vaccinated that their deaths resulted from the shots.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelmingly on the other side — that the vaccines have saved millions from the dire consequences of the disease.\n\nThat brings us to the reported “reinstatement.” Or as anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch put it on his Substack blog, “after a 7 month review by his university, Mark Skidmore was exonerated of all charges and his new, improved paper was published in a more credible peer-reviewed journal.”\n\nFollowing Gorski’s formulation, we’ll start with the “one possibly accurate piece of information.” That piece is a ruling by Michigan State’s Institutional Review Board, which oversees the ethics of research involving human subjects. On Sept. 13, the board informed Skidmore that it had found “no noncompliance” with its protocols.\n\nThat may be understandable. Skidmore’s defense against accusations of unethical treatment of human subjects that his critics had brought to the IRB was that he had based his paper on an anonymized third-party database, so he had no direct clinical contact with any human subjects and the research thus “posed little risk to human respondents,” according to Liberty Counsel, the conservative legal group that represented him in discussions with the IRB.\n\nBut that doesn’t get to the core problem of the paper. The “lie,” as Gorski describes it, is Skidmore’s claim that “COVID-19 vaccines might have killed well over a quarter million people by the end of 2021.”\n\nThere are simply no data to support that assertion. Skidmore’s calculation is a wild extrapolation from unreliable reports. It flies in the face of more solid evidence, which validates the CDC and Food and Drug Administration findings that the vaccines are safe. A 2022 FDA study, covering COVID vaccinations through mid-November 2021, found that death reports on VAERS were actually lower than all-cause death rates.\n\nThe most recent CDC statistics showed that of the 26,331 VAERS reports of problems from the bivalent boosters developed by Moderna and Pfizer authorized by the FDA in August 2022 and delivered through last spring, 2,032 were “serious,” a category that presumably includes death.\n\nBecause 55.2 million doses of the boosters had been delivered since then, the rate of “serious” complications came to less than four-thousandths of a percent of doses. And that figure was probably exaggerated, since the VAERS reports are, by their nature, unsubstantiated.\n\nFinally, there’s the “half-truth.” That’s the assertion that Skidmore’s study has been restored to the peer-reviewed literature.\n\nFirst of all, it’s still retracted by BMC, and there are no indications that the journal will backtrack, since its retraction was the result of extended negotiations with the journal editors, ending with Skidmore’s acknowledgment that he had no way of knowing whether the study subjects’ perceptions about their acquaintances’ vaccine-related injuries were accurate.\n\n“Validating reported fatalities is not possible with an anonymous survey,” Skidmore told the editors. Kirsch asserted on Substack that Skidmore’s “new, improved paper was published in a more credible peer-reviewed journal.” Is that so?\n\nThere are barely any differences between the original paper and the new version, which has been published in a journal called “Science, Public Health Policy, and the Law,” issued by the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The institute is a repository and publisher of anti-vaccination reports, including the long-discredited claim that autism is a consequence of childhood vaccinations.\n\nAs for the journal, its editorial board is composed 100% of vaccine skeptics, outright anti-vaxxers and dispensers of medically and scientifically unsupported treatments. Among its most recent articles is one that, amazingly, continues to push the antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, despite overwhelming evidence that it’s useless for the purpose. (That paper’s co-author is Mark Skidmore.)\n\nTo assert, as Kirsch does, that this journal is “more credible” than BMC Infectious Diseases, which is associated with the Nature publishing group, must be some sort of a gag. It’s true that questions have been raised about how BMC came to publish Skidmore’s paper in the first place, but at least the journal retracted it after critics pointed out its flaws.\n\nThe political landscape of COVID remains infected with misinformation on a pandemic scale. The Skidmore case underscores an observation seen in science, business and politics: Bad information always prevails over good information, unless the truth fights back, constantly and vigorously.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/965135', 'Headline': ""BMJ Slams 'Incompetent' Facebook Fact-Check of Vaccine Article - Medscape"", 'Snippet': 'It was previously reported that the whistle-blower is a former regional director who was involved in Pfizer\'s vaccine trials in Texas during the fall of 2020.

She alleges ""the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer\'s pivotal phase III trial.""\n\nThe images provided to The BMJ ""showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box"" and another displayed ""vaccine packaging materials with trial participants\' identification numbers written on them left out in the open, potentially unblinding participants.""\n\nDespite informing Ventavia, the director\'s concerns went unaddressed. She then filed a complaint with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was subsequently fired the same day. The FDA did not investigate the director\'s allegations, say Godlee and Abbasi, even though the evidence ""revealed a host of poor clinical trial research practices occurring at Ventavia that could impact data integrity and patient safety.""\n\nArticle Labeled as ""Hoax,"" Without Pointing Out Errors\n\nThe BMJ hired an investigative reporter to follow up on the clinical trial claims. The findings were published in an article on November 2, 2021, after the article ""went through...the usual high level legal and editorial oversight and peer review,"" according to the journal.\n\nHowever, by November 10, the journal began receiving complaints from readers unable to share the article on social media. Others had their posts flagged with warnings, such as ""missing context...independent fact-checkers say this information could mislead people."" Administrators of various Facebook groups were notified that posts containing the article were ""partly false.""\n\nReaders were informed that Facebook contractor Lead Stories performed the article\'s ""fact check."" Lead Stories is ""an award-winning innovative fact checking and debunking website"" and ""an active part of Facebook\'s partnership with third party fact checkers"" — with the latter granting them ""access to listings of content that has been flagged as potentially false by Facebook\'s systems or its users."" The company says they ""decide independently if we want to fact check it or not.""\n\nLead Stories states that they ""can enter our fact checks into a tool provided by Facebook and Facebook then uses our data to help slow down the spread of false information on its platform."" Although the contractor is compensated, Lead Stories claims they have ""no say or influence over what we fact check or what our conclusions are.""\n\nBoth editors question the validity of the fact check performed by Lead Stories, as it failed to provide any ""assertions of fact"" as to what The BMJ got wrong. Moreover, the editors take issue with Lead Stories referring to the journal as a ""news blog"" and using the phrase ""hoax-alert"" in the URL when publishing the story on its site.\n\nThe BMJ has reached out to Lead Stories and Facebook, says the letter, but Lead Stories refuses to ""change anything about their article or actions that have led to Facebook flagging our article."" Requests for Facebook to remove the ""fact checking"" label and allow ""readers to freely share the article on [Facebook\'s] platform"" have been unfruitful.\n\nGodlee and Abbasi expressed concern that other ""high quality information provider[s] have been affected by the incompetence of Meta\'s fact checking regime."" Last month, Instagram censored Cochrane, an international provider of independent systematic medical reviews. Instagram, also owned by Meta, prohibited users from tagging Cochrane because the organization ""repeatedly posted...false content about COVID-19 or vaccines."" Cochrane refuted the allegations.\n\nWhile ""fact checking has been a staple of good journalism for decades,"" say the editors, Meta has ""apparently delegated responsibility to people incompetent in carrying out this crucial task."" They urge the company to reconsider its fact-checking strategy and review the issues that contributed to the error.\n\nMedscape Medical News reached out to Meta for comment but did not receive a response at press time.\n\nLead Stories has posted a reply (Lead Stories\' Response To BMJ Open Letter Objecting To A Lead Stories Fact Check | Lead Stories) to The BMJ\'s complaint on its website.\n\nSteph Weber is a Midwest-based freelance journalist specializing in healthcare and law.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/05/30/fact-check-claim-misinterprets-data-2021-pfizer-report/9898129002/', 'Headline': 'Fact check: Claim misinterprets data from a 2021 Pfizer report - USA TODAY', 'Snippet': 'The claim: A Pfizer trial reports 42,000 adverse events and 1,200 fatalities As health care officials continue to urge Americansto get vaccinated and the coronavirus has led to more than 1 million ...', 'Full_text': 'The claim: A Pfizer trial reports 42,000 adverse events and 1,200 fatalities\n\nAs health care officials continue to urge Americansto get vaccinated and the coronavirus has led to more than 1 million deaths in the U.S., some online posts falsely claim the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine makes people sick and kills them.\n\n""So the leak distracted from the Pfizer dump. 46,000 people took the vaccine in a trial period...42,000 had adverse affects (sic) and 1200 died,"" reads an Instagram post shared May 5.

Jackson, a regional director, had witnessed problems at three trial sites she was overseeing and complained to an FDA inspector about a range of problems including falsified data, unblinded patients, and inadequately trained vaccinators who were slow to follow up on adverse events. “I thought that the FDA was going to swoop in and take care of everything. What I was reporting was so important,” Jackson told The BMJ. The FDA did not, however, inspect the trial sites in question.\n\nThis lack of oversight was not an isolated case, The BMJ has learnt. Regulatory documents show that only nine out of 153 Pfizer trial sites1 were subject to FDA inspection before licensing the mRNA vaccine. Similarly, only 10 out of 99 Moderna trial sites2 and five of 73 remdesivir trial sites3 were inspected.\n\nNow, facing a backlog of site inspections, experts have criticised the FDA’s oversight of clinical trials, describing it as “grossly inadequate.” They say the problem, which predated covid-19, is not limited to a lack of inspections but also includes failing to notify the public or scientific journals when violations are identified—effectively keeping scientific misconduct from the medical establishment.\n\nThe FDA is “endangering public health” by not being candid about violations that are uncovered during clinical trial site inspections, says David Gortler, a pharmacist and pharmacologist who worked as an FDA medical reviewer between 2007 and 2011 and was then appointed as a senior adviser to the FDA commissioner in 2019-21.\n\n“The lack of full transparency and data sharing does not allow physicians and other medical scientists to confirm the data independently and make comprehensive risk-benefit assessments,” continues Gortler, who is now a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington DC.'}}",98.5,1

For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/8-countries-that-reported-zero-covid-cases-as-per-who/photostory/89725668.cms', 'Headline': '8 countries that reported zero COVID cases as per WHO', 'Snippet': 'Micronesia.

Well, as per the reports of World Health Organisation (WHO), a handful of countries actually reported zero cases of COVID.\n\nIf this has you intrigued, checkout this list of countries with zero COVID cases.\n\nCredit: iStock\n\n02\n\nTokelau\n\nWith three tropical coral atolls in the South Pacific Ocean, Tokelau has been listed as COVID-19 free by the WHO. Since there are no airports, Tokelau is accessible primarily by ship. With a population of just 1500 residents, this destination also calls itself the first nation that is completely powered by renewable energy.\n\nCredit: iStock\n\n03\n\nTuvalu\n\nAs per the reports of WHO, nearly 50 out of 100 people are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in this destination. This island nation in the South Pacific comprises a group of six atolls and three reef islands. Although it’s a member of the Commonwealth, this island nation managed to keep COVID-19 at bay by resorting to mandatory quarantine and closing its borders.\n\nCredit: iStock\n\n04\n\nPitcairn Islands\n\nThese islands are located in the Pacific Ocean. Comprising four islands, i.e., Henderson, Oeno, Pitcairn, Ducie, this British Overseas Territory is known to be the least populated territory in the world. As per the records, Polynesians were the first inhabitants of the Pitcairn Islands, and it’s the only inhabited island. Also as per the records, it has a population of just 50 people and they managed to remain away from the virus.\n\nCredit: iStock\n\n05\n\nSaint Helena\n\nLocated in the South Atlantic Ocean, Saint Helena is considered one of the world’s most remote locations. Sitting more than 1200 miles west of Africa’s southwestern coast, and 2500 miles from Rio de Janeiro, it has a population of roughly 4500, and kept the virus at bay. And as per the reports of WHO list, 58 people per hundred population are fully vaccinated here.\n\nCredit: iStock\n\n06\n\nNauru\n\nThe tiny island country is situated northeast of Australia, and features white-sand beaches, a coral reef, including Anibare Bay on the east coast. It served as a Japanese outpost during the Second World War. Reports from the WHO list suggest that nearly 68 people per 100 are fully vaccinated here against COVID-19 here, and this island country kept the virus at bay and its citizens safe.\n\nCredit: iStock\n\n07\n\nMicronesia\n\nMicronesia is spread across the Western Pacific, and is made up of four island states. With more than 600 islands, its four island states are Korsae, Chuuk, Yap, and Pohnpei. This destination is famed for its wreck-filled dives, palm-shaded beaches, and ancient ruins. As per the reports of WHO, more than 38 people per 100 population are fully vaccinated in Micronesia, and it has also managed to stay away from COVID-19.\n\nCredit: iStock\n\n08\n\nNiue\n\nThis is another island nation in the South Pacific Ocean that has successfully managed to stay away from the COVID-19 virus.

For ...', 'Full_text': 'Over the past three months, the Chinese government has faced a seemingly debilitating series of crises. In late November, after years of large-scale lockdowns, closures, quarantines, and almost constant mass testing, Chinese citizens took to the streets and, for the first time, called into question the leadership of President Xi Jinping. Soon after, in response to the simmering discontent and other pressures, the government ended, virtually overnight, the “zero COVID” measures it had staked its public reputation on for nearly three years. Perhaps not surprisingly, what followed was a public health emergency in which the virus spread across some 80 percent of China’s highly vulnerable population. Hospitals and morgues overflowed, and more than one million people may have died. On top of all this, by the end of 2022, economic growth—long a sustaining pillar of the communist regime—had fallen to its lowest level in years.\n\nYet instead of going into crisis mode, Beijing has largely shrugged off these setbacks. It offered no official explanation for its abrupt reversal of zero COVID, and it weathered the high death rates that followed mainly by suppressing official data and not talking about COVID fatalities. On January 14, the government asserted that the viral wave had peaked. And to herald the Lunar New Year a few days later, state censors even launched a campaign aimed at “preventing the exaggeration of gloomy emotions.” To the outside world, meanwhile, China announced that it is open for business and that its economy is back.\n\nFor now, the strategy appears to have worked. Unlike the zero-COVID measures, the chaos and death that followed reopening produced little domestic backlash against the government. Many ordinary Chinese seem to have concluded that the health crisis was not a big deal; in rural areas, where the health system is weak and the virus ran rampant, many people who experienced symptoms or even died were unaware that they had been infected. In the go-go atmosphere of Beijing’s reopening, COVID-19 seemed to be quickly forgotten. “The virus has gone away . . . . God blesses China,” Hu Xijin, the former editor in chief of Global Times, a nationalist tabloid newspaper, wrote on Weibo, the Chinese social media platform, in late January.\n\nIn fact, Beijing’s response to the pandemic—both before and after zero COVID—could have significant implications for the one-party state over the long term. For one thing, as the years wore on, the zero-COVID strategy, sustained at enormous social and economic cost, seemed to have more to do with tightening the government’s grip on society than with effective pandemic mitigation, as the protests in November made clear. And the strategy was ultimately unable to prevent a devastating viral wave. Moreover, the high death toll that followed the sudden reopening—and the lack of active government engagement—raised new doubts about the ability of the regime to keep the population healthy. If the lesson for the Xi regime is that it is strong enough to weather a severe public health disaster, the government’s handling of the virus has also made clear that it is willing to sacrifice effective governance and even science in the interest of extending its power and control. In the long run, by breaking down the trust between Chinese society and the state, this power grab will create new challenges for Xi when the next crisis comes.\n\nONE MILLION DEATHS\n\nThe combined human toll of Beijing’s prolonged zero-COVID measures and its abrupt policy U-turn is by no means small. A growing body of evidence shows that during the three years that China maintained zero COVID, the very low rates of infection and mortality from the virus were achieved at significant cost to public health in other areas. For example, according to data from the National Health Commission, in 2020–21, deaths caused by cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases in urban areas increased by 700,000 over 2019 levels—a soberingly large number, even taking into account China’s population size. This very likely was the result of anti-COVID measures preventing timely access to health care.\n\nBeijing’s excessive pandemic measures also had far-reaching psychological and economic consequences. By December 2022, some 530 million Chinese were subject to lockdowns—more than the entire population of the European Union. Quite apart from the economic costs, such harsh measures, prolonged over weeks and months, also created profound social ruptures. In December, Qiao Zhihong, a leading Chinese psychologist, observed that over the past three years, there has been a considerable increase in the number of students with depression, anxiety, self-injury, and suicide. This trend became all the more pronounced in the later stages of the pandemic, when many Chinese began to see the government’s actions, such as the full-scale lockdown of Shanghai in the spring of 2022, as increasingly arbitrary and punitive. Out of step with the rest of the world, these measures also ran contrary to science and common sense, with some residents deprived of access to food and even medicine.\n\nChina likely had more COVID deaths in two months than the United States had in three years.\n\nThe rampant spread of infection and death that followed the abandonment of zero COVID on December 7 was in some ways even more traumatic. According to the official government tally, there were 82,238 COVID-19 deaths recorded in Chinese hospitals between December 8 and February 2, but both anecdotal evidence and case fatality data indicate that this is a vast undercount of the actual number. According to Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), by January 21, more than 80 percent of the population, or 1.13 billion people, had been infected with COVID-19. If we use his own case fatality ratio for the winter, which he put at between 0.09 percent and 0.16 percent, the reopening would have been associated with at least one million COVID deaths.\n\nWu’s data is supported by other models, including the Economist’s projection of 1.0 to 1.5 million deaths, based on assumptions about the unencumbered spread of COVID-19 after the reopening; the British-based Airfinity’s estimate of 1.3 million COVID deaths between December 1 and February 6; and a New York Times analysis, published on February 15, also estimating between 1.0 and 1.5 million deaths since the reopening. Anecdotal evidence from clinics, hospitals, morgues, and obituaries published by state-backed institutions suggests that the true death toll may have been closer to the high end of these estimates. Of course, the viral wave was playing out over a far larger population, but it is very likely that there were more COVID-19 deaths in China in two months than there were in the United States over the span of three years.\n\nEven leaving aside the human lives lost because of the stringent zero-COVID measures, the estimated deaths the Chinese government claims to have avoided—950,000 during 2020–21, according to Wu himself—have very likely been canceled out by the deaths associated with the messy and chaotic policy reopening. In other words, China spent billions of dollars maintaining an economically disruptive and ultimately socially damaging zero-COVID program for years only to suffer the same, if not worse, health consequences in the end.\n\nCONTROL AT ANY COST\n\nChina’s misguided and erratic COVID policies have exposed some fundamental truths about Xi’s regime. For one thing, they have demonstrated that contrary to his predecessors from Deng Xiaoping to Hu Jintao, who sought to make decision-making more technocratic and collective, Xi has strengthened the nonscientific and nondemocratic features of Chinese governance. Rather than providing the most effective and efficient solutions to the pandemic, many of the zero-COVID strategies served to extend the reach of the state. With the onset of the pandemic, Beijing saw an opportunity to pursue almost unchecked surveillance and control of the population. Reuters has reported that Chinese provinces spent more than $50 billion on COVID containment measures in 2022; over the three years that zero-COVID was in effect, the government is estimated to have spent as much as 200 billion yuan—$29.2 billion on PCR testing alone, according to data compiled by Hua Chuang Securities and Goldman Sachs. These immensely costly and invasive programs came at the expense of more efficacious policies such as full vaccination programs for the elderly. As Yasheng Huang, a scholar of international management at MIT, has observed, in implementing these far-reaching measures, Xi also broke the post-Tiananmen social contract “in which the Party would observe certain boundaries in exchange for society observing its own.”\n\nBy restricting the movement and freedom of hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens for almost three years, however, Xi also fell into a trap. He overestimated the extent to which preventing the spread of COVID-19 could be used to justify any measure, no matter how extreme or for how long. Indeed, it had already become clear during the lockdown of Shanghai in April 2022 that public tolerance was reaching its limit. Yet lacking effective feedback mechanisms, China’s top decision-maker evidently failed to realize the extent of public dissatisfaction until street protests erupted across major cities seven months later, calling for the zero-COVID program to end and even for Xi to step down.\n\nAs the virus raged through the country, the government talked about economic growth.\n\nBeijing’s failure of governance was also apparent in the abrupt policy shift that followed. Although a winding down of zero COVID was long overdue, the government’s December 7 decision immediately went awry because of the capricious and reckless way it was implemented. Rather than taking an incremental approach and preparing for the shift—say, by vaccinating the elderly or investing in surge capacity at hospitals and health clinics—Beijing simply announced the policy was ending. Worse, the government encouraged a “let it rip” approach to viral spread. Instead of trying to “flatten the curve”—the strategy that epidemiologists around the world have generally advocated—local administrations across China implicitly encouraged what was known as yingyang jinyang, “those who should be infected are all infected,” and kuaisu guofeng, “quickly bring the population to the viral peak.” That strategy, in combination with the shortage of medical supplies, hospital beds, and ICU equipment, led to the explosive rise of COVID-19 infections and deaths in December and January. And as the virus raged throughout the country, the government quickly shifted its policy agenda to economic growth.\n\nIn addition to exposing Xi’s policymaking as fundamentally autocratic, the shift from one extreme to the other also undercut people’s trust in government. After all, Beijing had spent nearly three years highlighting the grave danger of the disease and vowing to avoid the approach taken by other countries of living with the deadly virus, or tangping—“lying flat” as Chinese officials derisively called it. Yet in December, the government was suddenly saying the exact opposite: it justified the pivot away from zero COVID by downplaying the severity of the virus, and it adopted precisely the accommodationist approach it had once ridiculed.\n\nAt the same time, Chinese authorities also reneged on their promise to do whatever it takes to maximize people’s safety and health, abandoning much of the state’s vast testing infrastructure and asking people to bear the “first responsibility” for their own health. On social media, people shared information on their symptoms—which were often more severe than government health experts had described—and mocked the government’s official data on infections and mortality. As the columnist Yuan Li noted in late December, “Having nearly exhausted its resources and the good will of the public, the government has now simply disappeared, just as many Chinese are getting very ill with the virus or dying from it.”\n\nTHE HELMSMAN WILL NOT SAVE YOU\n\nDespite the multiple ways they have undermined the government’s credibility, Xi’s COVID blunders do not pose an existential threat to his regime. The government has continued to show it can cope with even deep challenges to its rule. Notably, it took officials just three days to quell the massive late November protests, which represented one of the most significant challenges to the party’s rule since the Tiananmen uprising. And although the abrupt, unplanned reopening did lead to many of the worst-case outcomes that zero COVID had been expressly designed to avoid—an overwhelmed health-care system and an exponential increase of COVID deaths—the widespread anguish and anger did not lead to mass panic or protests.\n\nPart of Beijing’s resilience was due to its control of information. Through obfuscation, stonewalling, and misinformation, the government managed to deflect the frustration of ordinary people away from itself. Instead, popular anger was directed at public health experts, who were accused of misleading people on the severity of the virus, and those who favored living with COVID-19, who were blamed for pressuring the government to reopen without any preparation. For the large portion of Chinese who think of themselves as being tizhinei (inside the system) or who have access only to government-sanctioned information, it was also relatively easy to buy into the narrative that the state had protected the people against the pandemic for three years, and now it was their turn to protect themselves.\n\nNowhere was this attitude more apparent than in rural areas. In the countryside, the fragile health-care system was woefully unable to handle the explosive growth of COVID-19 cases. But abetted by poor information and a fatalistic approach toward the pandemic among many local populations, rural areas weathered the crisis in large part because of the underutilization of local health-care institutions and the lack of access to COVID testing. In a strange twist, then, the weakness of the system proved to be its strength: since only those who were tested for COVID-19 and died in hospitals were officially registered as COVID fatalities, many deaths simply didn’t count. “The death of one man is a tragedy,” Joseph Stalin famously said. “The death of a million is a statistic.” But during China’s reopening, many who died did not even become a statistic.\n\nBy mid-January, it was clear that COVID death rates had peaked and that the government had muddled through. For all its daunting magnitude, the viral wave was fleeting and its exact extent, for many people affected by it, uncertain. The outcome paved the way for the government to declare, on February 16, a ""major decisive victory"" over COVID-19, similar to the one it proclaimed after the lifting of the lockdown in Wuhan three years ago. It is a stark display of the ability of a strong authoritarian regime to withstand even large-scale social crises through the control of information and the levers of power.\n\nStill, Xi’s extreme COVID strategies have left lasting scars on the Chinese state and its ability to govern. In 2022, China’s economic growth fell to three percent, the slowest growth rate since 1974. And although the economy is expected to rebound in 2023, it will be difficult for the hundreds of millions of Chinese who were affected by Beijing’s power overreach over the past three years to forgive and forget. In addition to eroding public trust in the government, the COVID crisis has made clear that a political system that has been tailored to a single superordinate figure is highly susceptible to disruption, shocks, and arbitrary decision-making. For now, like their government, ordinary Chinese may be glad to return to business as usual. But barring fundamental changes in the highly centralized and personalized rule under Xi, there is no guarantee that similar catastrophes will not be repeated with even greater consequences in the future.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/', 'Headline': ""What is China's zero-COVID policy and how does it work?"", 'Snippet': 'Nearly three years into the pandemic, China is sticking with a strict COVID-19 containment policy that has caused mounting economic damage and widespread frustration, while keeping its borders ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 5: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6242854/china-zero-covid-reversal-xi-jinping/', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-COVID U-Turn Reveals Xi Jinping’s Deep Paranoia - TIME', 'Snippet': 'It’s a quite staggering reversal.

On Tuesday, officials announced five deaths from COVID-19—up from two the previous day, which were the first recorded in the country since Dec. 3. On Wednesday, there were officially none. But a glance online tells a different story. Dozens of hearses line up at a Beijing crematorium; bodies wrapped in orange plastic pile in hospitals; patients on ventilators are crammed on a ward floor.\n\nThe decision by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership to roll back its stringent zero-COVID policy and allow the virus to proliferate has led to a surge in cases and an immense strain on health services. It’s a quite staggering reversal. On Nov. 10, President Xi Jinping—the self-anointed “commander-in-chief” of a “people’s war” against the virus—instructed his Politburo to stick “resolutely” to “dynamic zero-COVID.” Residents of Shanghai were forcibly detained in quarantine facilities over the summer because of a single case in a neighboring housing block.\n\nRead More: China’s Zero-COVID Trap\n\nBut zero-COVID was virtually abandoned on Dec. 7, with China’s top medical adviser now comparing the Omicron variant to “flu.” On Dec. 13, a tracking app that had tyrannized every life in China for the past three years was abruptly taken offline. On Sunday, officials in the central city of Chongqing decreed that mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases could “go to work as normal.”\n\nThe screeching U-turn underlines the fickle nature of strongman rule but also the immense paranoia of the CCP when faced with public discontent, such as the protests that erupted in late November across several Chinese cities. The catalyst was the deaths of at least 10 people in an apartment block fire in China’s western city of Urumqi that observers blamed on draconian pandemic controls keeping residents locked in their homes. (Officials deny this.) It spurred a wave of protests, with scores of people gathering on streets and university campuses across the country, shouting “we want freedom, not PCR tests,” and even “down with Xi Jinping.”\n\nRead More: Detained Zero-COVID Protesters in China Share Their Stories\n\nThe sudden rollback of restrictions that followed “could be seen as a victory for people power,” says Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nStill, the policy climbdown is surprising. China’s security services were swift to track down and detain demonstrators, who were never close to forming a political opposition. “They never quite galvanized into a single, unified, politically actionable message,” says Wen-Ti Sung, a scholar specializing in Chinese elite politics at the Australian National University. But what likely spooked Xi was the breadth of discontent that zero-COVID engendered. Affluent Shanghainese, embattled students facing bleak job prospects, and migrant workers in southern factories all railed against its privations and related economic blowback in distinct but analogous acts of rebellion. Their concerns were well-founded; models suggest zero-COVID may have cost the Chinese economy $384 billion and reduced GDP growth by 2.2 percentage points.\n\nIt’s perhaps unsurprising that a CCP spawned from popular revolution should fear the wrath of the masses most of all. In truth, however, over two-thirds of the 303 autocrats ousted from power worldwide between 1946 and 2008 were unseated by elite coups, with only a small minority bested by popular uprisings. The lesson being that rather than fear a mob over the horizon, leaders like Xi should be looking over their shoulder. It’s clear that he does the latter too, of course; by assuming a protocol-breaking third leadership term in November, while stocking his inner circle with loyalists and lackeys, Xi has doggedly insulated himself from potential rivals.\n\nHerein may lie the problem. The fear was always that this new leadership’s homogeneity would undermine the quality of its policy-making. “That it has been having a hard time facing its first major test—smooth transition out of zero-COVID—has not been helpful in dispelling those concerns,” says Sung. The government saw the economic pain of zero-COVID and wanted to make adjustments. But local officials who for the past three years have been judged first and foremost on stamping out the virus were naturally hesitant. So the central leadership had to take bolder steps to force their arm such as dismantling the nationwide tracking apparatus. Cue the lurch from one extreme to another. Today, China is caught between Xi’s two festering paranoias—fear of the people, and of challenges within the party.\n\nThe consequences may be dire. With virtually no community exposure to the virus, and only low efficacy domestic vaccines, the surge in cases will no doubt result in many deaths—some models predict over 1 million—despite official denials. Zhang Wenhong, a prominent Chinese doctor often likened to America’s Dr. Anthony Fauci, has warned that China’s medical institutions will face their “darkest hour” by next month.\n\nInstead, a new propaganda campaign has taken over. Previously, pandemic chaos in the West was painted as evidence of liberal democracy’s failings. Meanwhile, China’s success in banishing the virus was proof of a superior political system. But on Dec. 12, the CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily newspaper instead framed zero-COVID as a necessary stopgap to buy time while the virus’s severity waned and effective treatments were developed. Its dismantling, so it went, was always in the works. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” it wrote.\n\nThe problems with this account are myriad and glaring. If this opening up was long-planned, then surely more efforts should have been made to vaccinate the elderly. Currently, only 42% of over-80s have had three doses of the vaccines, according to government figures. Today, people seeking boosters are being turned away from clinics due to a lack of supply. The most vulnerable could have been given more effective foreign vaccines. (On Tuesday, the U.S. offered China mRNA vaccines, though nobody expects the nationalistic CCP to accept.) In addition, effective antivirals like Paxlovid should have been stockpiled; one Chinese website sold out its supply in half-an-hour.\n\nPublic health experts also struggle with the logic of opening up some six months after most Chinese have had their last jab, given the rapidly decreasing efficacy of vaccines over time. Not to mention there’s just weeks before China’s Spring Festival—humanity’s largest annual migration, when some 200 million Chinese cram into buses and trains for long journeys to ancestral villages where medical facilities are rudimental at best.\n\n“Even healthcare workers were caught off-guard [by the reversal],” says Huang.\n\nYet the CCP’s account is already written. On Dec. 14, authorities stopped reporting infections deemed “asymptomatic,” which in China is often stringently defined as those not confirmed with a chest scan. Then, on Dec. 20, officials said that they would only include on its official COVID-19 death tally those who had tested positive for the virus and died of respiratory failure or pneumonia—excluding anyone with complicating conditions, as is frequently the case with elderly patients. The aim is to push home the message that China suffered the lowest COVID-19 toll of any major power.\n\nMany Chinese will no doubt buy the propaganda. But a large number have had their eyes opened by the bungling of zero-COVID, the lives lost to suicides and treatable ailments that worsened in an ultimately futile attempt to stamp out the virus. The protests only serve to show that the party is, in fact, fallible and responsive to public anger, that the people have more power than anyone thought. “This will be very encouraging for Chinese civil society, which has had very little space to work in for years,” says Sung. The irony is, of course, that so far they have only nudged the CCP from suffocating control to callous inaction.\n\n“I don’t know how anybody can have confidence in China anymore,” says one Shanghai resident, speaking to TIME on condition of anonymity for fear of official reprisals. “Disruption and unexpected things is one thing, but a government pulling the rug under your feet is quite another.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6182781/china-zero-covid-economic-crisis/', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-COVID Policy Is Causing An Economic Crisis - TIME', 'Snippet': 'According to a study published May 10 by researchers from Shanghai’s Fudan University, Indiana University, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, relaxing COVID-19 restrictions in China ...', 'Full_text': 'In mid-May, I traveled from London to Slovenia to interview the Ukrainian men’s soccer team on their bid to reach November’s Qatar World Cup. It was a four-day assignment, requiring travel via train stations, airports, and taxi ranks—but at no point was I asked to show a negative COVID-19 test, my vaccination status, nor even to wear a facemask. I can barely recall seeing anyone wear one, least of all the elite sportsmen with whom I mingled daily. It was equally refreshing and disconcerting—as if Europe had forgotten that the pandemic had ever happened and was indeed still happening.\n\nIt was on this trip that a news alert flashed on my phone: China, on May 14, announced it was withdrawing from hosting the Asian Football Confederation Cup—the continent’s premier international soccer tournament—due to a COVID-19 outbreak that, on that same day, was responsible for only 65,000 cases and 45 deaths nationwide. That China is still wedded to a stringent zero-COVID policy focused on stamping out every infection, rather than mitigating severe illness and deaths, wasn’t a secret to anyone following the harsh lockdown endured by the 26 million residents of Shanghai, its biggest city, over the last two months. Still, it was surprising because Beijing, not too long ago, hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics without seeding a major outbreak and China’s leadership relishes in the prestige that accompanies these major sporting events. But what caught my eye most was the timing: the nixed tournament didn’t kick off until June 2023.\n\nWhat it suggests is that China has no intention of following the West into a vaccine-powered “living with the virus” dynamic. That’s bad news for China’s own economy and for any diminishing hopes worldwide of avoiding a global recession. Over the last two decades, China has contributed a quarter of the rise in global GDP—in that time, the first quarter of 2020 was the only one when its economy did not expand. Today, however, more than 200 million Chinese live under pandemic restrictions, battering an already slowing economy. Retail sales in April were 11% lower year-on-year, while housing sales—comprising over a fifth of GDP—plummeted 47% over the same period. Unemployment across a sample of 31 major Chinese cities is now the highest per official data since records began in 2018. Scenes from early May of workers fighting with public health officials at a factory producing Apple MacBooks in Shanghai after they were refused permission to leave their workplace to rest at on-site dormitories spotlights the mounting friction between economic priorities and public health.\n\n“Ordinary Chinese people have felt the heavy-handed authoritarianism of the Party in a much more direct and personal way than many people, especially young people, have before,” says Astrid Nordin, the Lau Chair of Chinese International Relations at Kings College London.\n\nRead more: China, Isolated From the World, Is Now the Last Major Country Still Pursuing a ‘Zero COVID’ Strategy\n\nSince China began market reforms in the late 1970s, its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has rooted its legitimacy in improving livelihoods. But over the last two years, President Xi Jinping has seized on China’s success conquering the virus as proof of the superiority of its political system over the West. These two success stories are now in direct conflict. On May 25, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang held an emergency meeting with over 100,000 party members where he warned China’s current economic woes were in some ways greater than the initial impact of the pandemic in 2020 and indicated that the annual growth target of 5.5% was unobtainable.\n\n“The economic crisis owing to draconian measures to control the outbreak really shows the mess, miscoordination, and miscalculations by leadership at the top,” says Valarie Tan, an analyst on Chinese elite politics for the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. “We’re finally seeing the full manifestation of this ideological turn by Xi Jinping.”\n\nStill, nobody expects Beijing to abandon its zero-COVID policy anytime soon. It’s especially sensitive for Xi as the 20th CCP Congress approaches in the fall, when the strongman is expected to assume a third five-year presidential term, ripping up the longstanding convention that leaders only serve two. The prospect of COVID-19 running amok while he takes this historic step won’t be countenanced. On May 5, the CCP’s Politburo’s standing committee, China’s apex political body, said zero-COVID was “determined by the nature and purpose of the Party,” thus expressly linking it with CCP legitimacy, while declaring that relaxing controls would lead to “massive numbers of infections, critical cases and deaths.”\n\nDespite the ideological nature of China’s zero-COVID obsession, this grim prognosis is not hyperbole. According to a study published May 10 by researchers from Shanghai’s Fudan University, Indiana University, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, relaxing COVID-19 restrictions in China could lead to 112 million cases and 1.5 million deaths in just three months. This is above all because China has not fully vaccinated 100 million of its 264 million citizens over 60, or 38%. In semi-autonomous Hong Kong, a wave of the highly transmissible Omicron variant led to some of the world’s worst daily mortality rates in recent months, with 95% of those deaths in over-60s who hadn’t been fully vaccinated.\n\nRead more: How Hong Kong Became China’s Biggest COVID-19 Problem\n\nIn this regard, China is a victim both of its success in stemming the spread of less transmissible variants and of its backslapping propaganda. Elderly people with scant desire to travel abroad saw no need to get vaccinated against a virus that the state had triumphantly declared vanquished. Meanwhile, owing to a pernicious blend of national security and national pride, China has not approved any foreign vaccines, meaning it doesn’t have access to the most effective types, which are those based on mRNA technology. Homegrown alternatives have spotty efficacy.\n\nNot that it really matters in a place where zero-COVID is the iron-clad law of the land. Even the best COVID-19 vaccines do not eliminate transmission, but they do slow the spread and drastically reduce the severity of symptoms. However, that renders them incompatible with any zero-COVID strategy, which doesn’t differentiate between mild or severe cases, or those in young and old. The policy targets infections, period, not sickness or deaths. “This is why it’s so political,” says Dr. Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the New York City–based Council on Foreign Relations. “Unless they abandon their zero-COVID mindset there’s really no way out of this.” Little wonder even the WHO says that zero-COVID is unsustainable.\n\nThe Chinese public are wising up to this fact and complaints about the government’s handling of the pandemic have become common even on the nation’s heavily censored social media. This has led to a new official edict: jingmo, or silence. Stop grumbling, in other words. During that May 5 Politburo standing committee meeting, Xi vowed to crack down on “all words and deeds that distort, doubt, and deny our epidemic prevention policies.” Ominously, China’s National Health Commission chief Ma Xiaowei wrote in CCP ideological journal Qiushi on May 16 that more “permanent” quarantine hospitals must be built and weekly testing “normalized.”\n\nNot hosting the AFC Cup won’t do much damage to China’s global reputation. But rolling lockdowns, which are sending China’s factories screeching to a halt, with cascading detrimental effects all the way down global supply chains, will make commercial partners look elsewhere. In Shanghai, China’s biggest port responsible for one-fifth of the country’s international shipping, average waiting time for import containers was 12.9 days on May 12, up from 7.4 days compared to six weeks earlier, according to shipment tracker Project 44.

Down with the World Health Organization!” a top reply said.\n\n“Should the UN’s verified account be blocked this time?” another said.\n\nBy mid-morning, the post was no longer viewable on Weibo “due to the author’s privacy setting.” It is unclear under what circumstances the setting was changed.\n\nA Weibo hashtag of Tedros’ name has also been censored, with images featuring his face being scrubbed from the platform, though posts containing his name are still visible.\n\nOn WeChat, an article from the UN’s official account that included Tedros’ comments has been “banned from sharing due to a violation of relevant laws and regulations” as of Wednesday morning. Video clips of Tedros’ speech have also been removed from the platform.\n\nTedros’ comments, though in line with the assessment of most scientists, have also drawn the ire of Beijing, which called them “irresponsible.”\n\n“We hope relevant people can view China’s epidemic prevention and control policy in an objective and rational way, learn more about the facts and refrain from making irresponsible remarks,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a news briefing Wednesday.\n\nChina’s zero-tolerance approach of snap lockdowns, mass testing and quarantining has protected the majority of its population from Covid over the past two years, but it has drawn rising dissent as the lockdowns become more stringent and frequent amid the fast spread of Omicron.\n\nShanghai, the country’s most populous and cosmopolitan city, is reeling from a six-week lockdown that has sparked public outcry, while the capital Beijing has shut schools, restaurants and rolled out frequent mass testing to curb its outbreak. Elsewhere, more local governments are imposing swift lockdowns in response to just a handful of cases.\n\nBut the Chinese leadership has insisted on the strict measures, saying a relaxation will “inevitably lead to large scale infections, a large number of serious illness and deaths” due to the country’s large number of elderly people and insufficient medical resources.\n\nNew modeling by researchers mostly from Shanghai’s Fudan University predicted China could face over 1.5 million Omicron deaths if its zero-Covid measures are lifted without increased vaccine coverage or access to antiviral therapies.\n\nReleased Tuesday by the journal Nature Medicine, the peer-reviewed study found that based on immunity levels as of March, an unchecked Omicron wave would exceed critical care capacity across the country, causing 112.2 million symptomatic cases.\n\nThe research estimates that in the event of an uncontrolled Omicron outbreak, China’s national healthcare system would be completely overwhelmed, with demand for the country’s 64,000 ICU beds outstripping supply 15.6-times over, for a period of at least 44 days.\n\nBut that scenario could be avoided, according to the modeling, if the Chinese government focuses on increasing “accessibility to vaccines and antiviral therapies.”\n\nMore than 88% of Chinese people have been fully vaccinated, but immunization is much lower among the elderly. As of March 17, only half of people aged over 80 in China have been fully vaccinated, and less than 20% of that vulnerable age group have received a booster. Unlike most countries, elderly people were not originally prioritized in China’s vaccination campaigns.\n\nSince the latest outbreak, Chinese officials have vowed to speed up vaccination among the elderly. But in locked-down areas, it is virtually impossible to get vaccinated as residents are confined to their homes and allowed to go out only for Covid testing.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00059-023-05183-5', 'Headline': 'The COVID-19 pandemic in China: from dynamic zero-COVID to current ...', 'Snippet': 'On 8 January 2023, after 3 years of pandemic control, China changed its management of COVID-19, applying measures against class B infectious diseases instead of Class A infectious diseases.

Each country and city may have its own unique circumstances that require additional considerations and adaptations [1]. China has a population of 1.41 billion. Due to this huge population base, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a scientific, gradual, and cautious approach. Preparations for the epidemic and changes in the external environment have created conditions for the reopening [2], including the evolvement of the external environment, gradual formation of the COVID-19 immune barrier, the increased awareness of virus prevention, the advancement in COVID-19 treatment, lower virulence of the Omicron variant [3], and the decreased severe COVID-19 rate and mortality rate [4].\n\nExpansion of healthcare capacity\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the reopening policy, mainly in the following aspects: First, to prepare for potential risks of medical resource overloading associated with the reopening, in the past 3 years, the National Health Commission of China has taken measures to expand healthcare capacity and make progress in treating COVID-19. Common fever clinics have been opened and critical care beds have been expanded to alleviate medical overloading. Medical institutions across the country have strengthened their respiratory infectious disease prevention and control capabilities, with increased medical beds and equipment, as well as improved medical rescue abilities. Moreover, China’s medical grading diagnosis and treatment system plays an important role in meeting the needs of patients and effectively operating the primary medical system. Antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been included in medical insurance through fast-approval channels, and maximum efforts are being made to provide drugs to patients in need. The government and health departments at all levels are providing human, financial, and material support to primary medical institutions to help establish an effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment mode.\n\nDuring the reopening period, China focused on enhancing the ability to treat severe COVID-19 cases, improving the efficiency of transferring severe cases, and preventing mild cases from becoming severe. The collective efforts of the public governance system helped to meet medical needs and navigate the peak of infections.\n\nVaccination program\n\nSecond, SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China [5]. With the widespread promotion and the national free vaccination policy, by early November 2022, over 90% of the total population had completed the full course of the new coronavirus vaccine. Research conducted by the National Major Scientific and Technological Infrastructure for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center showed that among infected individuals aged 60 or older who received two to three doses of the inactivated coronavirus vaccine, the rate of severe illness protection reached 90.15% [6]. The rate of severe illness protection for all infected individuals was reported to be 96.02%. Data released by a research team from the University of Hong Kong also supported the efficacy of domestically produced inactivated vaccines in preventing severe illness and death [7].\n\nEpidemic prevention and control mechanism\n\nThird, over the past 3 years, China has improved its epidemic prevention and control mechanism for COVID-19. The “State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism” was established as a multidepartment coordination platform to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. Through this mechanism, many local outbreaks have been successfully controlled, and guidelines have been developed by the National Health Commission and experts in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, medical treatment, and public health policy. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infection” has been updated ten times to provide up-to-date strategies and recommendations.\n\nWeakened viral virulence\n\nLast but not the least, the variant of SARS-CoV‑2 is accompanied by variable characteristics of the clinical picture, with disease severity appearing to be lower with the Omicron variant [8]. Some scientists warned that this does not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed less virulence than previous variants of concern and lung function was less compromised [9]. There is growing evidence to suggest that, with the protection of vaccines and improved treatment conditions, the harm of COVID-19 to the population has significantly decreased over time [10].\n\nThese are just some of the prerequisites for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus is highly contagious, and the short-term surge in confirmed cases is an undoubtful challenge faced by medical institutions after the reopening. The 3‑year period of hard and effective epidemic prevention and control in China has won valuable time and experience for the comprehensive opening up of the country. It seems that the threat of the virus to the population has become more manageable; thus, ending the dynamic zero-COVID policy and reopening the country supports economic recovery and international cooperation. In 2022, Omicron became the dominant strain in China, with a weakened pathogenicity resulting in mostly mild symptoms and a small proportion of severe cases. With high vaccination rates and effective epidemic control measures, the focus shifted from “dynamic clearance” to “protecting vulnerable populations.” On January 7, 2023, the State Council issued the 10th edition of the prevention and control plan, which emphasized vaccination and personal protection, optimized testing strategies, and outlined emergency measures during the epidemic.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25433800-100-zero-covid-strategies-are-being-ditched-but-they-were-the-best-option/', 'Headline': 'Zero-covid strategies are being ditched, but they were the best option', 'Snippet': 'Countries that followed the zero-covid playbook have done better on every measure, from death rates to economic growth.

One of the biggest shifts has been the abandonment of the “zero covid” strategy by countries like New Zealand and Vietnam, which are opening up and allowing the virus to spread.\n\nAs a result, it is tempting to think the approach was a mistake and that the strategy of nations like the UK has won out. But that is nonsense. Countries that followed the zero-covid playbook have done better on every measure, from death rates to economic growth. If more nations had implemented this approach, humanity would be in a better place. When the next pandemic emerges, governments should consider trying to eliminate it using zero-covid methods.\n\nThere is no single definition of a zero-covid strategy, but it generally means reducing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus as much as possible. This typically entails a rapid lockdown once the virus is detected in the community, followed by reopening once cases have fallen, combined with a robust system for testing, tracing chains of infection and supporting those who need to self-isolate.\n\nThe most obvious benefit is that far fewer people die. As of 18 March, New Zealand had seen 151 confirmed deaths from covid-19, or 0.003 per cent of its population – even though the virus repeatedly snuck into the country. In contrast, more than 164,000 people are confirmed to have died in the UK, which is 0.24 per cent of the population.\n\nZero-covid policies also cause less economic harm. When the virus is barely present, people feel confident going out, so the economy can reopen more fully. There is an economic cost to the initial lockdown, but many nations that allowed the virus to spread have also had lockdowns to save their health systems and so paid the same costs – and their lockdowns were often longer. A 2021 study found there was greater economic growth in zero-covid countries than in those that let the virus spread. The one big downside is that maintaining border controls hurt trade and tourism. But overall, zero-covid nations did better economically.\n\nAlthough zero covid was a successful strategy for countries like New Zealand, they are now abandoning it. A key factor has been the evolution of the virus. The delta variant was far more transmissible than the original virus, and the newer omicron variant is more transmissible still. These new variants can only be halted by truly draconian measures, so governments that previously banked on elimination have been forced to let the virus in.\n\nIf the target of zero covid is now being ditched, does that mean it was a failure? A crude answer would be: only if you think saving lives and preserving economic growth constitutes a misstep.\n\nLet’s go further. Consider what would have happened if, in early 2020, every country able to had adopted a zero-covid policy. It is incontestable that the global death count would be far lower, fewer people would have long covid and the economic damage would have been reduced. The virus would still be spreading, but slowly, and rising rates of vaccination would control it further. Crucially, omicron probably wouldn’t have had the chance to evolve.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, governments like the UK’s asserted that eliminating the virus was utterly impractical and so it was necessary to let it pass through the population in a “controlled” manner. Two years on, we know that was wrong.\n\nWhen the next pandemic emerges – as it will – governments should remember zero covid, and work together to eliminate the new threat if they feasibly can. Coordinated international action is hard, but we must learn to do it.\n\nMichael Marshall is a science writer in Devon, UK, and author of The Genesis Quest'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23573171/zero-covid-china-lockdowns-future-pandemics-public-health', 'Headline': 'What can the world learn from China’s “zero-Covid” lockdown?', 'Snippet': 'Meanwhile, in China, the nation’s zero-Covid policies dragged on for two years.

Unfortunately, these celebrations coincided with — and are sure to exacerbate — a Covid-19 outbreak currently spreading throughout the country.\n\nThis spike comes on the heels of China’s National Health Commission ending many of its “zero-Covid” policies in December. These public health regulations had heavily restricted travel within and to the country, quarantined infected individuals in government-run facilities, and enforced city-wide lockdowns that required millions to stay indoors for months at a time. While the US threw the term “lockdown” around in the early stages of the pandemic, China was one of the few countries that actually did lock down its population.\n\nThese initiatives did prevent repeated surges in Covid-19 cases. But it also led to inadequate responses to other health crises and emergencies — including a November 2022 building fire in the Xinjiang region where virus-related blockades prevented an effective emergency response. Protests over the last few months of 2022 bubbled across major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Urumqi, calling for an end to lockdowns, censorship, and in some cases, even Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s presidency.\n\nBeijing’s decision to end zero-Covid policies may have saved the nation from further social chaos. But how it eased up resulted in a public health crisis, with an estimated 2.02 million government-confirmed Covid-19 cases (though that’s likely an undercount) as of January 29, compared to 119,836 cumulative cases a year ago.\n\nAlthough a variety of zero-Covid strategies have been tried in different countries since the start of the pandemic, they have varied in intensity, length, goals, and outcomes. In some nations, lockdowns were used intermittently to control outbreaks and to give public health leaders time to develop and distribute vaccinations. China’s lockdowns were used as a primary prevention measure. Partially, China’s current outbreak stems from the country’s all-or-nothing mentality, experts told Vox. The country eased lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mass testing, all at once — and the virus came rushing in.\n\nLockdowns aren’t a popular public health strategy when strung out for long periods of time. But that doesn’t mean they can’t be a useful option in the pandemic playbook. Lockdowns cannot contain a disease like Covid-19 indefinitely — especially more contagious variants — but they can mitigate the spread and give public health leaders time to prepare for other aspects of their pandemic response, such as vaccinations. The public health lessons learned from the end of China’s zero-Covid era might be some of the most important in preparing for future pandemics and learning how to live with diseases.\n\n“At the beginning [of a pandemic], if there’s no treatment, no vaccine, and we have very limited knowledge about this new phenomena, a lockdown is more acceptable,” said Jennifer Bouey, chair of the global health department at Georgetown University. “Once there are vaccines, once there’s treatment, once we understand the nature of the pathogen, then they should be switched to a combination of different things.”\n\nLockdowns worked during SARS. China hoped they would work again.\n\nIn January 2020, only two days before the Lunar New Year, China banned travel to and from the 11 million-person city of Wuhan because of the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus, soon known as Covid-19. In March, as the threat of the virus grew, other countries closed their borders, with the World Health Organization declaring Covid-19 a pandemic.\n\nMany countries, including China, adopted true lockdowns as a means to stamp out the Covid-19 virus. These measures quarantined infected and exposed individuals, and locked down entire buildings, cities, and regions.\n\nChina had reason to believe this strategy would work again, given that during the outbreak of SARS — now called the SARS-CoV-1 virus — in the early 2000s, the nation used a citywide lockdown of Beijing in 2003 to contain the disease. “People didn’t go out for six weeks, school was canceled, the streets were empty, and the epidemic ended,” said Elanah Uretsky, chair of international and global studies at Brandeis University, of China’s SARS response. “It ended because of those lockdowns and massive quarantine policies. And we learned to believe in them.”\n\nIn the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, little was known about how the virus spread, so public health guidance changed constantly. The application and length of lockdowns varied by country. In France, there were clear guidelines that allowed residents to travel outdoors for activities such as walking a pet. In contrast, in Wuhan, only one member of a household was permitted outside every two days to buy necessary resources. New Zealand, an island country with a zero-Covid approach, prevented Covid cases and deaths early in the pandemic by closing its borders.\n\nHowever, Covid-19 proved to be more “elusive” than SARS, said Uretsky. Covid can present asymptomatically — unlike SARS — and therefore it can evade some contact tracing protocols. While it isn’t as deadly as SARS, Covid is more transmissible, meaning that one person infects multiple people at a higher rate.\n\nMeanwhile, it was difficult for countries with large populations and land masses, such as the US and China, to have the type of nationally coordinated response seen in smaller island nations like Singapore and New Zealand. Given its size and politics, the US was unable to nationally coordinate the country’s Covid response and instead relied on individual regions or states to dictate public health measures.\n\nInstead of zero-Covid, the US opted for a strategy of “flattening the curve,” which entailed decelerating the rate of Covid-19 infection to ease the burden on hospitals. “I think China’s massive error, considering that their population is enormous, was not doing what many countries did, or strived to do, which was ‘flatten the curve,’” said Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist with the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.\n\nIn mid-2021, even nations that had maintained low case numbers and death rates through lockdowns adjusted their policies, and instead focused on vaccination campaigns and ramping up contact tracing efforts. Wealthy nations with access to vaccines began immunizing their populations in December 2020, and by the end of August 2021, over 2 billion people were fully vaccinated. Over the last year and a half, many former zero-Covid countries prioritized administering booster vaccines and slowly phased out contact tracing protocols.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, the nation’s zero-Covid policies dragged on for two years. The nation was able to keep cases low, relative to its population, until March 2022. At that time, the omicron variant of the virus swept through the country, leading to a lockdown in the 25 million-person city of Shanghai for two months. This extended lockdown sparked anger among residents and would add fuel to the growing anti-government sentiments that manifested via protests later that year.\n\nWhy China’s post-zero-Covid era is going so poorly\n\nAfter over 150 partial and full city-wide lockdowns and months-long protests, China released new Covid-19 guidelines in early November and early December that softened or reversed earlier zero-Covid practices. In November, the guidelines cut down isolation time, removed mass testing sites, and increased resources to health care facilities. In December, health codes (proving lack of Covid exposure or a negative test result) to enter most public spaces were no longer required and infected individuals with mild or no symptoms could quarantine at home rather than at government-run facilities.\n\nHowever, China lifted these policies not because it was prepared to do so, but because of political pressure from the nationwide protests, said Ha-Linh Quach, a research assistant at Duke NUS medical school in Singapore. Quach — who also previously worked with Vietnam’s National Committee of Covid-19 — said Vietnam followed China’s lead when attempting to manage the spread of the virus, but also found that mass quarantines were publicly unpopular. Instead, in 2021 the country began prioritizing social distancing, mask-wearing policies, and vaccine distribution.\n\nUnlike other countries — like Taiwan, South Korea, or Singapore — that used periods of strict lockdowns to prepare for their inevitable reopening, and the internal travel that it would spawn, China did no such thing, said Uretsky.\n\nRather than reopening in stages, China lifted many of its most useful measures all at once — despite the fact that prior to easing these regulations, Covid cases were already on the rise. “Unfortunately for China, lack of preparation for the inevitable breach of an increasingly infectious pathogen results in exactly what we’re seeing,” said Miller.\n\nFor example, alongside these eased regulations, China announced it would ramp up its vaccination of the elderly, something the experts Vox spoke to say should have happened much earlier. When the restrictions were lifted, only 40 percent of Chinese residents above the age of 80 had received a Covid-19 booster shot, according to China’s National Health Commission.\n\nOther countries that exited periods of intense lockdowns, such as Vietnam, not only used vaccines to prepare, but also bolstered their social distancing policies and contact tracing programs as they transitioned, said Quach.\n\nAs part of its zero-Covid policies, China used a digital health code system that assigned users QR codes based on their exposure and testing status, and that were needed to enter public spaces. Now, these codes are no longer required to access many public areas or to travel in China.\n\nYet Singapore, when the nation lifted many of its zero-Covid policies in June 2021, continued to use its version of these health codes for almost a year. These codes helped Singapore track down those who were exposed to someone with Covid-19 at an expedited rate. “It is not a breakthrough technology,” Quach said. “But it’s amazing to me how it is being used for public health.”\n\nThat said, these codes, while effective in the small nation of Singapore, had limited success in China due to the country’s size and lack of data-sharing. “On paper, it can work, but it’s very difficult to implement in the real world, especially in such a large country,” said Bouey. “It turns out that every province is doing their own work, and they’re not integrated. So when people travel from one province to another, the code suddenly doesn’t work.”\n\nLack of data and rampant misinformation have also exacerbated China’s post-lockdown problems. The current outbreak is thought to have begun in November 2022, and although the official number of total Covid-19 deaths in China, as of January 30, is now over 110,000 — which would still be low relative to the nation’s 1.4 billion population — the true figures are thought to be much higher. One model from December predicted that as many as 1 million people could die from Covid in China over the first few months of the year, but without transparent information from Beijing, these forecasts remain speculative.\n\n“In the absence of data, there is misinformation,” Miller said. “I think the seeds of the spread of Covid were already happening in China. But the information as to the extent of it and the location of it would have allowed people to make informed decisions. In the absence of that, people are making whatever decision they want to make.”\n\nWhat this teaches us for the next pandemic\n\nAssuming another unknown virus will spread across the globe again in our lifetimes, the Covid-19 pandemic has given public health leaders fresh insight into what policies can be most effective in mitigating the spread of diseases. And lockdowns, when used appropriately and swiftly, remain a useful tool in our arsenal for early pandemic days.\n\nCovid-19 was actually the “ideal candidate” for lockdowns, said Miller. This is because of the virus’s highly transmissible, airborne, and often asymptomatic nature. “Candidates for lockdown include pathogens that are novel to human populations, and therefore there is no innate immunity to them,” Miller said. “Highly infectious pathogens for which there are (currently) no vaccines or treatments are also candidates for lockdown.” In theory, the only type of diseases that lockdowns cannot mitigate are those that are not transmitted via human-to-human contact, such as water or foodborne illnesses, said Bouey.\n\nLockdowns give leaders time to develop vaccination distribution campaigns, set up contact tracing programs, and learn more about the pandemic-causing disease, Miller added.\n\nThis is why it’s important to distinguish between “short-term lockdowns with underlying goals” and “long-term lockdowns that hope to beat the odds and keep Covid out indefinitely,” said Miller. Brief lockdowns that helped “flatten the curve” were effective and helped keep hospitalizations and deaths down. But extended lockdowns, like the ones seen in China, failed to contain the virus and damaged the country’s economy and well-being.\n\n“As we have seen, these lockdowns are very disruptive, in terms of economic livelihood, as well as social life and even mental health,” said Bouey. “There is profound damage to the society and to the economy.”'}}",92.5,1

The last time that happened in metro Chicago was February 2020, a month before the city announced its first COVID-19 death.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in metro Chicago — which includes a total of 14 counties in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — remained below 4% again in both June and July.\n\nWhile it might be premature to declare an end to the regional economic emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of pre-pandemic unemployment levels for three consecutive months is, perhaps, a sign that the worst is behind us.\n\nWBEZ analyzed more than 20 years of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Current Population Survey to get a closer look at the region’s elevated unemployment rates during the pandemic. We wanted to see how they compared with rates during earlier times of economic upheaval. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSharper spike and speedier recovery\n\nIn April 2020, metro Chicago’s unemployment rate jumped nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month to 18.72%. That’s the highest jump and the highest rate in a single month since at least 1990, the earliest date for which regional unemployment data was available on the bureau’s website.\n\nBy January 2021, the unemployment rate had dipped below 7%. By November 2021, it fell below 5%, and it dropped below 4% this May. While unemployment took more than three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, it was a shorter recovery period compared to the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe economic downturn resulting from the housing market crash is considered to have lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During that window, the rise and fall of unemployment in metro Chicago was not nearly as dramatic as during the pandemic, and the higher rates dragged on for much longer. The region’s unemployment began its slow and steady ascent in August 2006, when it was 4.45%. That rate increased each month, reaching a peak of 11.49% in January 2010 — almost 3 1⁄2 years later. The rate slowly decreased over the next few years, but it didn’t dip below 5% until January 2017.\n\nUnequal patterns among racial groups\n\nNo racial or ethnic group of workers, no age group and no gender in metro Chicago was immune to the sting of the pandemic.\n\nBut for some groups, unemployment spiked higher or lasted longer, according to a WBEZ analysis of raw data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll of the U.S. labor force sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOnce the rates came down, they settled into the same unequal patterns that existed before the pandemic, the analysis shows.\n\nThe estimated unemployment for Latinos in metro Chicago skyrocketed at the onset of the pandemic — growing in April 2020 from under 6% to more than 23%. It would top 20% again in both May and June of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Black nor white workers saw rates top 20%. For white workers, unemployment also jumped dramatically from less than 4% to nearly 16% in April 2020. In that month, Black unemployment rose from under 9% to nearly 17%, a smaller increase than for the other groups. Black unemployment didn’t reach its peak of nearly 19% until August 2020, according to the WBEZ analysis.\n\nHowever, overall unemployment estimates for white and Latino workers settled back to pre-pandemic rates much faster than they did for Black workers. White unemployment fell below 4% for three straight months by October 2021. Latino unemployment dipped below 6% for three consecutive months by November 2021. Unemployment for Black workers in metro Chicago didn’t drop below 9% for three consecutive months until July 2023.\n\nIn addition, for much of the past two decades, Black unemployment estimates in the region have typically remained at least twice as high as those for white unemployment. Since 2000, the average monthly unemployment estimate for Black workers in metro Chicago has been about 12.63%, which is comparable to the 13.19% average monthly unemployment estimate for white workers during the four months when it was at its peak — from April to July of 2020.\n\nSince 2000, those were the only four months when white unemployment estimates topped 10% in metro Chicago. However, for Black workers, unemployment estimates have topped that mark in 209 months since 2000.\n\nEssential workers meant lower pandemic unemployment\n\nThe surge in Latino unemployment may have been influenced by the large share of Latino workers in the restaurant and food services industry, one that was hit hard during the earliest months of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, restaurant and food services was the leading industry for Latino workers in metro Chicago. But by April 2020, unemployment for restaurant and food service workers was nearly 45%. It didn’t fall back to single digits until September 2021.\n\nIn recent months, however, the industry appears to have rebounded. Restaurant-related unemployment has been below 4% in six of the eight months between December 2022 and July 2023. And the region’s estimated number of workers in that industry topped 340,000 in July 2023, the highest such figure since June 2019.\n\nAs it might be expected in a public health crisis, unemployment for hospital workers has been much lower and far more stable. It was just 4% in April 2020. It climbed to 10% in May 2020 before falling below 7% in June 2020.\n\nThe leading industry for Black workers in 2020 was hospitals, the WBEZ analysis shows. That might have helped keep Black unemployment from growing as dramatically as it did for other groups during the first few months of the pandemic.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/data-deep-dive-how-government-benefits-programs-are-contributing-to-the-labor-shortage', 'Headline': 'Data Deep Dive: How Government Benefits Programs Are Contributing to ...', 'Snippet': 'A new report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation takes a closer look at benefit cliffs and how proposed policy changes have affected the labor market when implemented in various states.

Millions of Americans benefited from pandemic relief payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, and bolstered social programs.\n\nThese support mechanisms provided necessary help to many families during difficult times, but these same programs can discourage Americans from joining or rejoining the workforce—especially when increased earnings do not make up for the loss in benefits.\n\nAs businesses continue to grapple with a national workforce shortage, a flawed government benefits framework is one of many factors keeping Americans on the sidelines of the labor force.\n\nThis page dives deep into the effect pandemic benefits had on Americans\' financial wellness and unintended “benefit cliffs,” the point at which benefits are cut off, which can discourage labor market participation.\n\nThe impact of enhanced unemployment benefits\n\nDuring the pandemic, more than 20 million Americans received unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. From March 2020 to September 2021, the federal government provided an additional $300 - $600 a week to any person who was earning at least $1 in UI benefits.\n\nThe enhanced UI benefits were generous compared to regular UI benefits. On average, UI typically replaces 38% of a claimant’s average weekly wage.\n\nThe enhancement meant that most individuals were earning more on unemployment than they were while working, boosting Americans’ savings accounts, and deterring many from returning to work.\n\n24%\n\nThose who say government aid packages during the pandemic incentivized them to not actively look for work\n\n21%\n\nThose who say they never expect to be back to work full time\n\nSource: U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n\nEnhanced unemployment insurance and pandemic relief checks helped facilitate historic savings during the pandemic—as did the limited options for spending those savings as many normal spending options were unavailable, or significantly limited. Although those savings are coming down, in total, Americans saved about $2.7 trillion during the pandemic, 10% of the nation’s GDP.\n\nHistorically, layoffs and health emergencies stress Americans’ bank accounts and unemployed workers are eager to return to a steady paycheck. But during the pandemic, savings accounts broke with tradition and rose to unprecedented levels.\n\n$2.7 trillion\n\nThe amount Americans saved during pandemic, equal to 10% of the nation’s GDP\n\nDespite savings dwindling, labor force participation has not gone up\n\nMany Americans were able to live off the money they’d put aside, postponing a return to work. Now, more than a year out from pandemic checks and enhanced benefits, Americans are seeing their saving account dwindle with prices rising and spending on necessities resuming. But despite savings levels coming down, there has not been a substantial increase in the nation’s labor force participation.\n\nThe labor force participation rate still lags around one percentage point below where it was at the start of the pandemic, meaning nearly three million workers are still missing from the workforce.\n\nAlthough there are other barriers keeping Americans out of work, like access to childcare, navigating the loss of government benefits when earnings or savings increase is a contributing factor keeping Americans out of work right now.\n\nNavigating a loss in government benefits\n\nMost states provide 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. During that time, unemployed individuals are required to look for suitable employment and are often matched with reemployment services. Not all claimants find work by the time their UI benefits end, however. In these cases, additional government programs become critical.\n\nState and federal government benefit programs are available to assuage some difficult financial situations for low-income families and individuals. Benefits are administered at the state and federal level and most often are targeted toward a certain expense—food, care, and housing.\n\nA majority (70%) of public benefits go to non-elderly people who work, and more than half of all workers in the bottom 20% of the wage distribution receive public benefits.\n\n41 million\n\nPeople receiving SNAP benefits in 2021\n\n1 million\n\nFamilies receiving TANF benefits in 2020\n\n80.5 million\n\nPeople enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP in 2021\n\n2.2 million+\n\nFamilies receiving housing choice vouchers in 2021\n\nSource: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; County Health Executives Association of California; The Pew Charitable Trusts\n\nWhile many programs operate on a sliding scale, gradually phasing out as income rises (like SNAP benefits), some programs are terminated at the onset of increased earnings or accrued savings.\n\n$10,326\n\nAnnual value of Medicaid benefits when earned income reaches $11,000\n\n$7,552\n\nValue loss of annual SNAP benefits when income reaches $35,000\n\nThe sliding scale and income thresholds lead to what is known as the “benefits cliff”—the point at which benefits are cut off. In some situations, the increased earnings do not make up for the loss in benefits. For this reason, some recipients are deterred from obtaining employment, working additional hours, or pursuing promotions and career development.\n\nThe two charts below from a report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation describe the effect and severity of benefit cliffs.\n\nTake for example, public assistance in Durham County, North Carolina. Bundled public benefits decrease as earnings increase. However, if wages increase from $11,000 to $27,000 the family will experience a gap in health coverage between Medicaid and American Care Act subsidies because North Carolina is a non-expansion state for Medicaid.\n\n""Qualitative research reveals important insights about how employees navigate benefits cliffs,"" says Mathieu Despard, Ph.D., MSW. ""A 2016 study of benefit recipients in Cincinnati found that none of the recipients made a job or career decision based on impending benefits cliffs. Instead, these workers said they needed help in making the transition from public benefits to wage gains, such as budgeting for food amidst a loss in SNAP benefits, and that they felt worse off financially despite wage gains. Though workers preferred not to receive public benefits, they felt unprepared in losing these benefits.""\n\nA current snapshot of American’s financial wellness\n\nThe impact of benefits cliffs are especially relevant when considering the current financial wellness of Americans. With prices rising and pandemic savings dwindling, navigating benefits is more important than ever.\n\nDebt levels are beginning to rise again\n\nDebt levels declined during the pandemic, especially credit card debt. The drop in debt and rise in savings put consumers’ personal balance sheets in a strong position. However, debt levels are starting to rise as prices rise because of high inflation, the end of government pandemic benefits, and an increase in spending now that pandemic restrictions are mostly over.\n\nFurther, many did not pay their rent or mortgages during the pandemic. That moratorium is over which means they now need to make these large payments. With savings accounts no longer growing, prices rising, and spending on necessities resuming, Americans will see rising levels of debt as interest rates are climbing.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, overall debt levels have increased by 5.4%, according to the New York Federal Reserve. Credit card debt, however, decreased during the same timeframe. In 2021, Americans acquired mortgages, car payments, and personal loans while paying down credit cards.\n\nIt’s also interesting to note that a majority (61%) of American consumers are living paycheck to paycheck. While this standard financial lifestyle is most common among those who earn the least, living paycheck to paycheck exists across all income levels. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are precariously close to financial distress should an emergency occur.\n\n61%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck\n\n79.9%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn less than $50k\n\n63.8%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn $50k-$100k\n\n42.2%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn more than $100k\n\nA proper social net should encourage and enable labor market entry, financial stability, and economic mobility. However, the steep benefit cliffs discourage labor market participation and promotion.\n\nChanging the current framework would allow employers to fill open jobs and maximize productivity while also ensuring beneficiaries can reach self-sufficiency, build assets, and increase net worth. Policy changes that help achieve this balance include raising income limits, phasing out benefits more gradually, implementing continuous enrollment and transitional benefits, and eliminating asset tests.\n\nA new report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation takes a closer look at benefit cliffs and how proposed policy changes have affected the labor market when implemented in various states.

Legislators gathered back in November for the first time since adjournment in April 2022 for a two-week Veto Session. The two-week term was rather quiet, with legislators opting to leave many of the “bigger” issues unresolved until the Lame Duck Session, which ran from January 4 through January 11.\n\nWith numerous proposals being considered during that time, the Chicagoland Chamber worked to ensure that the interests of the Chicago business community were well represented.\n\nChamber and Business Groups Negotiate Successful Resolution of Historic $4.5B Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund Deficit\n\nDuring the 2022 fall Veto Session and January 2023 Lame Duck Session, the Chamber, working with business partner organizations, labor representatives, the Governor’s Office, and the General Assembly, agreed to a package that eliminates the $4.5 billion Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund deficit that accumulated during the early days of the pandemic, saving employers nearly a billion dollars in higher unemployment insurance taxes.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, the Chamber and other business groups successfully negotiated the utilization of $2.7 billion of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to be applied to the $4.5 billion Title XII debt incurred during the pandemic—largely in 2020, when government-mandated closures and operating restrictions were imposed on businesses. At the time, almost every other state used ARPA funds for repaying UI trust fund debt. Per federal law, when a state Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund drops to a negative balance, federal funds are automatically borrowed. If the borrowing occurs for a period of two or more years, employers lose credit against their federal unemployment insurance tax—meaning employers will pay higher taxes.\n\nIn September 2022, the Pritzker Administration swapped $450 million from the state UI Trust Fund balance to further pay down a portion of the $1.8 billion federal Title XII debt left outstanding after the $2.7 billion payment was made in mid-2022. Then in December, Governor Pritzker signed SB 1698 (P.A. 102-1105) to provide for the substantive language of the deal, which (1) authorizes the State to use surplus revenues to pay the remaining $1.36 billion Title XII debt and (2) provides for the substantive agreement reached between business and labor groups. The final deal will mitigate tax increases on employers, improve predictability for employers, and bring greater stability to the UI Trust Fund, which was an initial ask of the labor groups. The deal is fair for both employers and workers. In the January Lame Duck Session, SB 2801 passed both the Illinois House and Senate to provide for the appropriation language necessary to finalize the agreement. It is expected that the Governor will sign the bill soon.\n\nThe UI deal is significant for Illinois employers and negates roughly $913 million in additional taxes that employers would have had to pay over the next five years. Perhaps, just as importantly, the deal and bipartisan roll call that ensued preserves the Unemployment Insurance Agreed Bill process, which has been in place since the 1980s and informally requires any legislation impacting the Unemployment Insurance System from advancing without an agreement from both business and labor groups. Without the agreed bill process, we most certainly would see annual employer tax increases. You can find the Chamber and business coalitions fact sheet on the agreement here.\n\nBusiness Development Proposal Passes with Chamber’s Strong Support\n\nEvery year, the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce advocates for more State funding, support, and investment by the State in business development. Although the State has many programs and services in place that are meant to help employers throughout the state, amendments are often required.\n\nThe Government Relations team successfully managed to secure transformational changes to some of these state programs, including the following:\n\nGovernor’s “Invest in Illinois” Program: Given the State received an unexpected amount of tax revenue in 2022, due in large part to the lingering positive impact of the pandemic on consumer spending and business earnings, the Governor proposed the creation of a “closing fund”, which would grant the State the ability to offer new or existing businesses that are relocating, expanding, or making substantial investments in Illinois the ability to offer one-time cash grants to incentivize the projects. Other states, such as Ohio, Texas, among others, have perennial closing funds that they use to attract projects to their states. This year, the General Assembly headed the call and created the Invest in Illinois Program. $400 million were allocated to the program this year.\n\nEDGE Tax Credit Program. The bill (1) increases EDGE credits in projects located in underserved areas equal to 50% of the tax attributed to retained employees, (2) erodes the ‘but for” clause requiring EDGE credit applicants from demonstrating other State offers and cost differentials; and (3) reduces the requirement to self-certification. The EDGE program is one of the State’s biggest economic development tools used to attract and retain jobs in Illinois through a series of income and payroll tax credits.\n\nFilm Tax Credit Program. Extends the sunset date of the program from January 1, 2027 to January 1, 2033 to allow prospective film or TV productions to have reliability in the program. The Film Tax Credit Program each year helps sustain the rapid growth of the film and TV industry in Illinois by offering productions with several tax incentives to film in Illinois.\n\nExpands Enterprise Zones. Expands the allowable square mileage of a Zone. The EZ program allows for various tax benefits to be offered to businesses that are activated in a Zone.\n\nImproves High Impact Business Program. Doubles the length of an allowable designation of a HIB and removes the requirement for businesses to prove that the incentive is needed. HIB is a tool that the State offers large business expansions or investments in new projects in the State.\n\nREV Credit Program. Expands the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles (REV) in Illinois Act (currently, Reimagining Electric Vehicles in Illinois Act) to allow renewable energy product manufacturers to be eligible for REV credits, in addition to changing eligibility requirements to allow small-to-mid size businesses to apply for the credit. REV was first created in 2021 to incentivize new electric vehicle manufacturers and component part manufacturers to build in Illinois.\n\nMakes changes to the MICRO Act to grant DCEO the ability to determine criteria for the renewal of incentives provided under the Act. Increases the amount of MICRO credits for projects meeting retained employee goals to match new employee incentives. Allows for MICRO credits to be renewed for a total of either 20 or 30 years.\n\nCreates a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchase sales tax credit from fuel purchased in Illinois by an air carrier from June 1, 2023 to January 1, 2033 in the amount of $1.50 per gallon of sustainable fuel. Prohibits the collection of the credit on soybean oil-derived SAF until air carriers collectively purchase SAF containing 10 million gallons of soybean oil feedstock.\n\n“Paid Leave for All Workers Act” Passes, Chamber Negotiates Deal\n\nPaid Leave is an issue that has been hotly debated for over five years in the Statehouse, with advocates typically leading the way to push for convoluted, onerous, and punitive proposals on employers. An agreement was finally brokered last week—with the Chamber playing a key role in making sure the best deal for business was reached.\n\nOnce it was clear that advocacy groups, unions, and Democratic leadership were eager to pass a bill in the last week of Session before the start of a new term, the business community came to the negotiating table seeking two main provisions: (1) require that any paid leave law passed by the General Assembly would be clear, easily implemented, and require no more than five days of leave and (2) prohibit the City of Chicago or Cook County (both jurisdictions that already have paid sick leave mandates in place) from enacting their own version of paid leave. In the end, through much negotiation, the final bill that has been sent to the Governor for his signature will contain the following:\n\n5 days of paid time off a year\n\nThere is no requirement for an employee to qualify why their leave is being taken, easing the administrative burden on employers\n\nThe employer may establish a specific process by which an employee may request time off if the request is made prospectively\n\nThe time may be front loaded or rolled-over\n\nExempts collective bargaining agreements\n\nRequires employers to maintain proper records for no less than three years\n\nFor employers that already have a leave policy in place that meets the requirements of this new law, no policy change is required\n\nProhibits retaliation\n\nAllows the Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL) to investigate any claims alleging a violation of the Law, and allows the IDOL to impose fines ranging from $500-$1000 for violations of the act, in addition to legal awards and additional civil penalties.\n\nThe new Law will go into effect on January 1, 2024 and does not apply to any employer that is currently subject to the paid sick leave ordinances that are in effect in the City of Chicago or Cook County.\n\nOther Notable Action\n\nSB 1720 (Sims/Harris) – FY23 BIMP 2.0, which has passed both Chambers and needs to be signed into law by 12 p.m. on January 16 in order for the salary increases to go into effect. Notable provisions include:\n\nProvides for increased salaries for Constitutional Officers, Agency Directors, and members of the General Assembly\n\nThe establishment of the Warehouse Safety Standards Task Force\n\n$5 million to DCEO to administer a Local Chamber Recovery Grants program\n\nAllows the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board to make grants to local units of governments and schools for the purpose of hiring and retaining law enforcement officials\n\nIncreases the cap on the Budget Stabilization Fund from 5% to 7.5% of total general funds estimated for the fiscal year and transfer $850 million from GRF to the Budget Stabilization Fund\n\nProvides the authorizing language to appropriate $460 million to hospitals throughout Illinois as hospital pandemic recovery stabilization payments\n\nProvides that, if and only if House Bill 4285 of the 102nd General Assembly becomes law, then the small purchase limit in the Procurement Code is reduced from $250,000 to $100,000\n\nHB 969 (Harris/Harmon) – FY23 Supplemental Appropriations package\n\nSB 2801 (Holmes/Welch) – Finalizes the agreed-bill Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund deal to (1) appropriate $1.37 billion from GRF to UI Trust Fund to pay the remaining outstanding federal UI Title VII debt and (2) appropriate $450 million to the UI Trust Fund as a loan to be repaid over a 10-year period. The bill as amended by the House Exec Committee unanimously is awaiting House Floor action before going back to the Senate for concurrence.\n\nSB 1001 (Belt/Zalewski) – Eliminates state and local fees for liquor delivery throughout Illinoi and brings parity for liquor delivery between home-rule and non-home rule municipalities to regulate liquor delivery.\n\nHB 240 (Jones/Gillespie) – Hospital and health care omnibus package\n\nHB 4412 (Willis/Cunnningham) as amended by SA #1 – Limited changes to various energy-related provisions. The most controversial changes pertain to facility siting changes opposed by some units of local government.\n\nHB 268 (Williams/Feigenholtz) as amended by SA #1 – Creates the Tourism Preservation and Sustainability District Act, otherwise known as Tourism Improvement Districts. Similar to Business Improvement Districts, the legislation allows hotel owners to opt into a districts whereby special surcharges are assessed to be used only for the development, services, and benefits of the businesses contained in the Tourism Improvement District. The Chamber continues to discuss a similar model known as Business Improvement Districts with the City of Chicago and other stakeholders.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.chicagotribune.com/2021/12/28/unemployment-down-consumer-prices-up-experts-paint-a-picture-of-the-2022-economy/', 'Headline': 'Unemployment down, consumer prices up: Experts paint a picture of the ...', 'Snippet': 'Employment in 2022.

And while business economists agree, they along with Walsh also say COVID-19 will continue to create plenty of unknowns, especially the omicron variant taking hold.\n\nWalsh said the employment picture will improve organically, but noted that government and private industry must learn some lessons from the supply chain bottlenecks, for instance, and figure out how to expand both manufacturing and the training necessary to get workers into those jobs, he said. That could help eliminate some of the logistical problems we’re seeing now with shipping goods from overseas and getting them into the hands of consumers, economists say.\n\n“We’re … looking at how industry is going to grow in our country,” Walsh said. “You know, consumer purchasing has not stopped,” even as prices have risen, “so we’ve got to make sure we continue the supply chain moving forward. We’ve still got to make goods and products here.”\n\nFor now, supply chain woes are expected to continue to drive up consumer prices through at least the first half of 2022. Earlier this year, experts had described monthly jumps in some consumer prices as a blip, but have since taken a longer view.\n\n“Policymakers up until maybe September were saying this increase in inflation is concentrated within a few industries of certain goods — for rental cars and stuff like that; but that comfortable narrative was out the window by October,” said Michael Weber, an associate professor at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, pointing to across-the-board increases in inflation.\n\nIn mid-December, the government reported U.S. consumer prices jumped 6.8% over the past year — the highest in nearly 40 years, triggering concerns that the nation may be in for a protracted period of inflation. In Illinois, consumer prices in November jumped 6% from a year ago.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s annual inflation target is 2%.\n\nCurbing inflation\n\nIn response to surging inflation, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced the central bank will reduce its monthly bond purchases — intended to lower long-term rates — at twice the pace it had previously set and will likely end the purchases in March. That puts the Fed on a path to start raising interest rates as early as the first half of next year, which is expected to tap the brakes on rising prices.\n\nWhat’s more, the policymakers collectively forecast that they will raise their benchmark short-term rate three times next year — a significant increase from September, when the 18 officials had split over whether to hike it even a single time in 2022.\n\nThe slow and methodical approach means prices will tick up at rates higher than the central bank — and consumers — would like to see, one expert said.\n\n“There’s always a lag and the change of Federal Reserve policy just takes a while to transmit into … making an effective change in the economy,” said Phillip Braun, clinical professor of finance at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “So I think we’re gonna see inflation — maybe not what we’re seeing right now — continuing throughout 2022 at some level above 2%.”\n\nWith experts blaming the choked supply chain for inflationary pressures, the omicron variant could very well exacerbate the problem if countries have to once again look to shutdown orders in order to curb the spread of the virus.\n\n“It may mean that supply chain bottlenecks are here to stay for a longer period than we were thinking they might be,” said the U. of C.’s Weber.\n\nEmployment in 2022\n\nA survey released in early December by the National Association for Business Economics found that its panel of forecasters expects the current unemployment rate of 4.2% to drop to 3.8% by the end of 2022.\n\nWhile Illinois tends to follow national trends, the state has had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country — even before the pandemic.\n\nIllinois’ jobless rate dropped from its pandemic high of 16.5% to 5.7% in November, according to the most recent federal job numbers for the state. With one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, that’s above the national average of 4.2%. Illinois consistently ranks among the highest when compared with other states, but fared better than California, which had the highest unemployment rate at 6.9%, Nevada at 6.8% and New York, where the jobless rate was 6.6%.\n\nStates with higher unemployment numbers tend to have major metro areas with diverse populations, said Braun. Longtime hiring disparities have meant that Black unemployment is higher than average, experts say. Nationally, the unemployment rate among Black residents was nearly 2 percentage points higher than the overall average, at 6.7%.\n\nChicago’s unemployment rate, which includes data from Naperville and Arlington Heights, stood at 6.2% in November, according to labor department data. The jobless rate was even higher in the nation’s two other largest cities: Los Angeles area’s unemployment numbers stood at 8.9% while New York City’s jobless numbers stood at 9%.\n\nLabor shortages\n\nLabor shortages, too, are expected to persist into the new year as what’s known as the “Great Resignation” continues.\n\nIn Illinois, the most recent data shows that workforce participation has fallen by 182,000 between October 2019, when the state’s labor force participation rate was 64%, and October 2021, when it was about 62%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n“What we’ve seen pretty dramatically over the last couple of months in particular is that labor force participation is actually way lower than before the pandemic and people are just out of the labor force,” Weber said.\n\nSome of that is owed to a wave of early retirements brought on by the pandemic, while others exited to take care of family members. Others decided it wasn’t safe working in high-contact industries like leisure and hospitality.\n\n“Of course having the vaccine widely available in the last year, we thought that might alleviate some of those concerns, (but) there’s a fraction of the population that doesn’t want to be vaccinated. And at some point workers are deciding they just don’t want to be exposed to the virus,” Weber said.\n\nWith the new variant emerging, people who might be thinking about finding a job may instead sit it out.\n\n“So those are also kind of a couple of uncertainties that actually indicate we’ll most likely see labor shortages going forward,” Weber said.\n\nBusinesses have been boosting wages to lure workers for months now and it doesn’t look like that’s going to end any time soon, Weber said. For consumers, that may mean forking over even more money for goods and services, something they may not bat an eye at.\n\n“If consumers have high inflation expectations, and actually expect prices to rise then (businesses), of course, have a way easier time passing on the increased costs to consumers,” Weber said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nldonovan@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @byldonovan'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://newschannel20.com/news/local/new-data-shows-illinois-has-a-higher-unemployment-rate-than-national-average', 'Headline': 'New data shows Illinois has a higher unemployment rate than ... - WICS', 'Snippet': 'The national average unemployment rate is at 3.5%.

The CES survey is a Federal-State cooperative endeavor between State employment security agencies and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDefinitions. Employment data refer to persons on establishment payrolls who receive pay for any part of the pay period which includes the 12th of the month. Persons are counted at their place of work rather than at their place of residence; those appearing on more than one payroll are counted on each payroll. Industries are classified on the basis of their principal activity in accordance with the 2017 version of the North American Industry Classification System.\n\nMethod of estimation. CES State and Area employment data are produced using several estimation procedures. Where possible these data are produced using a ""weighted link relative"" estimation technique in which a ratio of current-month weighted employment to that of the previous-month weighted employment is computed from a sample of establishments reporting for both months. The estimates of employment for the current month are then obtained by multiplying these ratios by the previous month\'s employment estimates. The weighted link relative technique is utilized for data series where the sample size meets certain statistical criteria. For some employment series, the estimates are produced with a model that uses direct sample estimates (described above) combined with other regressors to decrease volatility in estimation.\n\nAnnual revisions. Employment estimates are adjusted annually to a complete count of jobs, called benchmarks, derived principally from tax reports which are submitted by employers who are covered under state unemployment insurance (UI) laws. The benchmark information is used to adjust the monthly estimates between the new benchmark and the preceding one and also to establish the level of employment for the new benchmark month. Thus, the benchmarking process establishes the level of employment, and the sample is used to measure the month-to-month changes in the level for the subsequent months. Information on recent benchmark revisions is available online at https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/benchmark.htm.\n\nReliability of the estimates. The estimates presented in this release are based on sample surveys, administrative data, and modeling and, thus, are subject to sampling and other types of errors. Sampling error is a measure of sampling variability—that is, variation that occurs by chance because a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed. Survey data also are subject to nonsampling errors, such as those which can be introduced into the data collection and processing operations. Estimates not directly derived from sample surveys are subject to additional errors resulting from the specific estimation processes used. The sums of individual items may not always equal totals shown in the same tables due to rounding.\n\nEmployment estimates. Changes in metropolitan area nonfarm payroll employment are cited in the analysis of this release only if they have been determined to be statistically significant at the 90-percent confidence level. Measures of sampling error for the total nonfarm employment series are available for metropolitan areas and metropolitan divisions at www.bls.gov/web/laus/790stderr.htm.\n\nArea definitions. The substate area data published in this news release reflect the delineations issued by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget on April 10, 2018. The 12 metropolitan areas discussed in this release are the metropolitan areas with the largest population according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area includes Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, and Will Counties in Illinois; Jasper, Lake, Newton, and Porter Counties in Indiana; and Kenosha County in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Chicago-Naperville-Arlington Heights, IL Metropolitan Division includes Cook, DuPage, Grundy, Kendall, McHenry, and Will Counties in Illinois.\n\nThe Elgin, IL Metropolitan Division includes DeKalb and Kane Counties.\n\nThe Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI Metropolitan Division includes Lake County in Illinois and Kenosha County in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Gary, IN Metropolitan Division includes Jasper, Lake, Newton, and Porter Counties in Indiana.\n\nAdditional information\n\nEmployment data from the CES program are available on the BLS website at www.bls.gov/sae/.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.

But the life of the 35-year-old Air Force veteran from California, Ashli Babbitt, was far more complicated. In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected].\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist - The New York ...', 'Snippet': 'On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol ...', 'Full_text': 'A mountain of evidence shows that the rioters were supporters of Mr. Trump, but that has not stopped the cascade of specious claims seeking to pin responsibility on others.\n\nA false theory blaming agitators affiliated with antifa, a loose collection of antifascist activists, began to spread on social media before the riot had even ended. Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot', 'Headline': 'Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot', 'Snippet': 'claim: ashli babbitt was killed by an officer working for democrats Babbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the ...', 'Full_text': 'Millions of Americans watched the events in Washington last Jan. 6 unfold on live television. Police officers testified to the violence and mayhem. Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.\n\nYet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public’s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained attack on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.\n\nBy excusing former President Donald Trump of responsibility, minimizing the mob’s violence and casting the rioters as martyrs, falsehoods about the insurrection aim to deflect blame for Jan. 6 while sustaining Trump’s unfounded claims about the free and fair election in 2020 that he lost.\n\nSpread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes.\n\nSeveral different conspiracy theories have emerged in the year since the insurrection, according to an analysis of online content by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs on behalf of The Associated Press. Unfounded claims that the rioters were members of antifa went viral first, only to be overtaken by a baseless claim blaming FBI operatives. Other theories say the rioters were peaceful and were framed for crimes that never happened.\n\nConspiracy theories have long lurked in the background of American history, said Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University professor who studies political misinformation. But they can become dangerous when they lead people to distrust democracy or to excuse or embrace violence.\n\n“If we’re no longer operating from the same foundation of facts, then it’s going to be a lot harder to have conversations as a country,” Carnahan said. “It will fuel more divisions in our country, and I think that ultimately is the legacy of the misinformation we’re seeing right now.”\n\nAn examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T TRUMP SUPPORTERS\n\nIn fact, many of those who came to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said — proudly, publicly, repeatedly — that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nDifferent versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa.\n\n“Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,” Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.”\n\nThe next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim.\n\nAnother Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven’t been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants.\n\nYet Carlson claimed on his show that “in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.”\n\nCarlson is a “main driver” of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal’s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.\n\n“Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,” Gaetz said.\n\nSpokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.\n\nIn truth, the rioters are just who they said they were.\n\nOne was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.\n\n“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans said on the video. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” Vice President Mike Pence was in the building to preside over the Senate’s certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. Pence went ahead despite Trump’s pleas to get Pence to block the transfer of power.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by “fake Trump protesters.”\n\n“We have not seen evidence of that,” said Wray, who was appointed by Trump.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T VIOLENT\n\nDozens of police officers were severely injured. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and died a day later of natural causes.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who rushed to the scene, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” The assault stopped only when he said he had children. He later learned he had suffered a heart attack. Fanone resigned from the department in December 2021.\n\nRioters broke into the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled under armed protection. They rifled through desks and looked for lawmakers, yelling, “Where are they?” In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.\n\nThat’s not how some Republican politicians have described the insurrection.\n\nAppearing on Ingraham’s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.\n\n“By and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has since said that he doesn’t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a “normal tourist visit.” Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.\n\nTrump called the insurrection a display of “ spirit and faith and love.”\n\nRioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose.\n\n“The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,” Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. “And, you know, I won’t be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.”\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS\n\nTrump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nImmediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been “cheated” and “defrauded” in the “rigged” election by a “criminal enterprise” that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol.\n\nAt one point, Trump did urge his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.” The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric.\n\n“We fight. We fight like hell,” he told those who would later break into the Capitol. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nNow, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.\n\n“I wasn’t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,” Trump said on Fox News in December.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN OFFICER WORKING FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nBabbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed. An investigation cleared the officer of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Capitol Police Department protects all members of Congress, as well as employees, the public and Capitol facilities. The officer wasn’t assigned to any particular lawmaker.\n\nTrump falsely claimed the officer was the head of security “for a certain high official, a Democrat,” and was being shielded from accountability. He also misstated where Babbitt was shot.\n\n“Who is the person that shot … an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?” Trump asked on Fox News.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE JAN. 6 SUSPECTS ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ARE BEING MISTREATED\n\nNo, they are not, despite some assertions from members of Congress.\n\n“J6 defendants are political prisoners of war,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted in November. She said she had visited some suspects in jail who complained about the food, medical care and “re-education” they were receiving in custody.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said the Justice Department was “harassing peaceful patriots” by investigating their involvement in the insurrection.\n\nWhile it’s true some of the suspects have complained about their time in jail, it’s wrong to argue they’re being held as political prisoners. Authorities have said the suspects in custody are being given the same access to food and medical care as any other inmate.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://reason.com/2022/01/04/ashli-babbitts-violent-past-doesnt-justify-her-death/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's Violent Past Doesn't Justify Her Death - Reason.com"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt\'s Violent Past Doesn\'t Justify Her Death.

In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/ashli-babbitt-a-martyr-her-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/2829546/', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a Martyr?

When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother.

Her Past Tells A More Complex Story', 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt, who lived in San Diego, was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Associated Press, News Partner. Posted Tue, Jan 4, 2022 at 9:40 am ...', 'Full_text': ""Ashli Babbitt, who lived in San Diego, was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop.\n\nAs she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family.\n\nTimothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt's birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day.

Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas. He must reportedly surrender on or after Jan. 5, 2024.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/ashli-babbitt-jan-6-insurrectionist-portrayed-as-martyr-by-some-had-violent-past', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt, Jan. 6 insurrectionist portrayed as martyr by some ... - PBS', 'Snippet': 'In 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend.

An Executive Summary[7] of the committee\'s findings was published on December 19, 2022; a Final Report[8] was published on December 22, 2022.[9]\n\nDuring the first hearing on June 9, 2022, committee chair Bennie Thompson and vice-chair Liz Cheney said that President Donald Trump tried to stay in power even though he lost the 2020 presidential election. Thompson called it a ""coup"".[10] The committee shared footage of the attack, discussed the involvement of the Proud Boys, and included testimony from a documentary filmmaker and a member of the Capitol Police.\n\nThe second hearing on June 13, 2022, focused on evidence showing that Trump knew he lost and that most of his inner circle knew claims of fraud did not have merit. William Barr testified that Trump had ""become detached from reality"" because he continued to promote conspiracy theories and pushed the stolen election myth without ""interest in what the actual facts were.""[11][12]\n\nThe third hearing on June 16, 2022, examined how Trump and others pressured Vice President Mike Pence to selectively discount electoral votes and overturn the election by unconstitutional means, using John Eastman\'s fringe legal theories as justification.[13]\n\nThe fourth hearing on June 21, 2022, included appearances by election officials from Arizona and Georgia who testified they were pressured to ""find votes"" for Trump and change results in their jurisdictions. The committee revealed attempts to organize fake slates of alternate electors and established that ""Trump had a direct and personal role in this effort.""[14][15]\n\nThe fifth hearing on June 23, 2022, focused on Trump\'s pressure campaign on the Justice Department to rubber stamp his narrative of a stolen election, the insistence on numerous debunked election fraud conspiracy theories, requests to seize voting machines, and Trump\'s effort to install Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general.[16]\n\nThe exclusive witness of the sixth hearing on June 28, 2022, was Cassidy Hutchinson, top aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.[17] She testified that White House officials anticipated violence days in advance of January 6; that Trump knew supporters at the Ellipse rally were armed with weapons including AR-15s yet asked to relax security checks at his speech; and that Trump planned to join the crowd at the Capitol and became irate when the Secret Service refused his request. Closing the hearing, Cheney presented evidence of witness tampering.[18]\n\nThe seventh hearing on July 12, 2022, showed how Roger Stone and Michael Flynn connected Trump to domestic militias like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys that helped coordinate the attack.[19][20][21]\n\nThe eighth hearing on July 21, 2022, presented evidence and details of Trump\'s refusal to call off the attack on the Capitol, despite hours of pleas from officials and insiders. According to the New York Times, the committee delivered two significant public messages: Rep. Liz Cheney made the case that Trump could never ""be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again"", while Rep. Bennie Thompson called for legal ""accountability"" and ""stiff consequences"" to ""overcome the ongoing threat to our democracy.""[22]\n\nThe ninth hearing on October 13, 2022,[23][24] presented video of Roger Stone and evidence that some Trump associates planned to claim victory in the 2020 election regardless of the official results.[25][26] The committee voted unanimously to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony,[27][28] and a subpoena was issued one week later.[29] Trump refused to comply.[30]\n\nThe tenth hearing on December 19, 2022, convened to present a final overview of their investigative work to date, and the committee recommended that former President Donald Trump, John Eastman, and others be referred for legal charges. The committee also recommended that the House Ethics Committee follow up on Rep. Kevin McCarthy (CA), Rep.

This messaging presented a challenge for them, in part because they did not know in advance what information the committee would reveal at the hearings.[68][69] McCarthy spoke to donors on the morning of the second hearing, advising Republicans to ignore the proceedings, refuse public comment and avoid the topic. He suggested their party should instead discuss election issues that could garner more votes, such as focusing on rising inflation or fuel prices. Insiders have said former president Trump was not necessarily pleased with this strategy and felt there was ""no one to defend"" him.[70]\n\nPreliminary hearing – July 27, 2021\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nZoe Lofgren – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 19th district)\n\nAdam Kinzinger – Committee Member, Representative (R-IL 16th district)\n\nAdam Schiff – Committee Member, Representative (D-CA 28th district)\n\nPete Aguilar – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 31st district)\n\n(D-MD 8th district)\n\nStephanie Murphy – Committee Member, Representative (D-FL 7th district)\n\nJamie Raskin – Committee Member, Representative (D-MD 8th district)\n\nElaine Luria – Committee member (D-Va 2nd district)\n\nOfficer Harry Dunn – United States Capitol Police, Washington, DC\n\nOfficer Michael Fanone – Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, DC\n\nSergeant Aquilino Gonell – United States Capitol Police, Washington, DC\n\nOfficer Daniel Hodges – Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, DC\n\n–\n\n–\n\nSynopsis of preliminary hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 27, 2021, the committee held a hearing titled ""The Law Enforcement Experience on January 6th [2021]"".[42][71]\n\nAccording to C-SPAN, ""January 6 Committee Meeting with Capitol and D.C. Police: Capitol and District of Columbia police testified at the first hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. Witnesses described their experiences on that day and efforts to protect the Capitol and elected officials. Throughout the hearing, graphic video footage captured during the attack was shown.""[72]\n\nThe four officers—Dunn, Fanone, Gonell, and Hodges—were given a front-row seat to all of the committee\'s public hearings in 2022.[73] All four, along with others, received the Presidential Citizens Medal from Joe Biden on January 6, 2023.[74]\n\nFirst hearing – June 9, 2022 – Primetime\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nCaroline Edwards – police officer, Capitol Police\n\nNick Quested – documentary filmmaker\n\nMarcus Childress – investigative counsel for the Select Committee[75]\n\nCandyce Phoenix – senior investigative counsel for the Select Committee[75]\n\nWilliam Barr – former Attorney General of the United States[76][77][78]\n\nJason Miller – senior Trump campaign spokesman[79]\n\nAlex Cannon – Trump campaign lawyer[80]\n\nIvanka Trump[81]\n\nJared Kushner[82]\n\nRichard Donoghue – former Acting Deputy Attorney General of the United States[83]\n\nMarc Short – Chief of Staff to Vice President Pence\n\nMark Milley – General, Chairman Of The Joint Chiefs Of Staff[84][85]\n\nJeremy Bertino[75]\n\nEnrique Tarrio – former Chairman of the Proud Boys[75]\n\nStewart Rhodes – founder, Oath Keepers[75]\n\nDonald Trump\n\nMike Pence\n\nSteve Bannon\n\nJim McGovern – Representative (D-MA 2nd district)\n\nJanuary 6 arrestees[86]\n\nRobert Schornack\n\nEric Barber\n\nJohn Wright\n\nGeorge Meza – member, Proud Boys\n\nDaniel Herendeen\n\nMatthew Walter\n\nUnnamed January 6 rioters\n\nSynopsis of first hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThis was the first of the hearings for broadcast on live television and was held during prime time. The committee showed never-before-seen footage of the Capitol attack to provide an accessible and compelling narrative of events for the public.[87]\n\nOpening statements by the panel members\n\n[edit]\n\nThe committee panel observed that Donald Trump attempted to overturn a free and fair democratic election by promoting a seven-part conspiracy.[88][89] According to Bennie Thompson, chairman of the committee, ""Jan. 6 was the culmination of an attempted coup, a brazen attempt, as one rioter put it shortly after Jan. 6, to overthrow the government ... The violence was no accident. It represents Trump\'s last stand, most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power."" According to the committee, Trump ""lied to the American people, ignored all evidence refuting his false fraud claims, pressured state and federal officials to throw out election results favoring his challenger, encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol and even signaled support for the execution of his own vice president.""[88][89]\n\nPanel members made reference to a federal district court opinion in which the Judge David O. Carter said Trump had ""likely"" violated two federal statutes and staged a ""coup in search of a legal theory"".[90][91] Rep Liz Cheney read part of the opinion, in which the court said:\n\nIf Dr. Eastman and President Trump\'s plan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution. If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself.[92]\n\nCheney urged all Americans to read the opinion in full. Cheney said Trump\'s efforts were part of a ""sophisticated seven-part plan"", which the committee hearings would establish.[93]\n\nThe Trump administration\'s seven-part plan to overturn the 2020 election, according to the January 6 Committee[93][94]\n\n1. Trump had knowledge that he lost the 2020 election but spread misinformation to the American public and made false statements claiming significant voter fraud led to his defeat;\n\n2. Trump planned to remove and replace the Attorney General and Justice Department officials in an effort to force the DOJ to support false allegations of election fraud;\n\n3. Trump pressured Vice President Pence to refuse certified electoral votes in the official count on January 6, in violation of the U.S. Constitution;\n\n4. Trump pressured state lawmakers and election officials to alter election results in his favor;\n\n5. Trump\'s legal team and associates directed Republicans in seven states to produce and send fake ""alternate"" electoral slates to Congress and the National Archives;\n\n6. Trump summoned and assembled a destructive mob in Washington and sent them to march on the U.S. Capitol; and\n\n7. Trump ignored multiple requests to speak out in real time against the mob violence, refused to instruct his supporters to disband, and failed to take any immediate actions to halt attacks on the Capitol.\n\nA written version of the above plan was released after the hearing.[94][95]\n\nTrump knew that he lost\n\n[edit]\n\nMany in Trump\'s inner circle informed the president he had lost and there was no evidence of widespread fraud. According to several video clips of prior testimony shown by the committee:\n\nA senior adviser to the Trump campaign, Jason Miller, testified that Trump was internally advised he had lost the election. According to Miller, the campaign\'s top data aide, Matt Oczkowski, told Trump very shortly after the election ""in pretty blunt terms, that he was going to lose"".[96]\n\nTrump campaign lawyer Alex Cannon testified he had spoken to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in November 2020 soon after the election and told Meadows there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud. According to Cannon, Meadows replied: ""So there\'s no there there.""[97]\n\nAccording to his testimony, attorney general Bill Barr ""said that Trump’s claims of voter fraud were \'bullshit\'"".[97]\n\nIvanka Trump said she ""accepted"" Barr\'s assessment.[97]\n\nRush to issue presidential pardons\n\n[edit]\n\nCheney observed White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his team of lawyers had threatened to resign in response to an increasingly hostile climate of lawless activity within the Oval Office. Another video clip was then shown in which Jared Kushner characterized Cipollone\'s concerns as ""whining."" During his testimony, Kushner claimed that his primary ""interest at that time"" was to complete as many presidential pardons as possible.[98] Cheney also said that Representative Scott Perry and other Republican members of Congress had ""sought Presidential pardons for their roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election.""[44]\n\nAttack on the Capitol\n\n[edit]\n\nThe committee showed video, much of it never before seen by the public, of the mob charging the Capitol and battling police. The video began with scenes of roughly 200 Proud Boys leading the assault on the Capitol. As later scenes showed a violent rampage, audio was overlaid of Trump later saying, ""The love in the air. I\'ve never seen anything like it."" As the attack lasted several hours, the video contained timestamps to illustrate the timeline.[99] Documentary filmmaker Nick Quested provided testimony during the live hearing; he was embedded with the Proud Boys on January 6. Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards also testified live and in-person; she was seriously injured[100] on January 6 while defending the Capitol against initial attacks by Proud Boys and during the mob violence that followed.[101]\n\nQuested testified that he joined the Proud Boys at the National Mall at 10:30 a.m., saying ""I don\'t know if violence was a plan, but I do know that they weren\'t there to attend the rally because they had already left the rally by the time the president had started his speech."" According to Quested, they then walked around the Capitol while taking some pictures and observed a sole police officer at the barricades by the Peace Circle.[44] After suggesting the Proud Boys were doing reconnaissance to spot security weaknesses, Chairman Thompson observed that the Proud Boys chose that barricade and breached it at about the same time President Trump directed the rally attendees to march to that same location. He then said:\n\nNow a central question is whether the attack on the Capitol was coordinated and planned. What you witnessed is what a coordinated and planned effort would look like. It was the culmination of a months\' long effort spearheaded by President Trump.[44]\n\nOfficer Edwards, who had sustained multiple injuries during the attack, testified that the group of Proud Boys who first approached the police barricades began by shouting rhetoric to turn the police into ""villains"" and then began their assault. She described in detail her experiences and injuries as police fell back. When asked what she remembers most vividly, Edwards described moving from an area with a relatively small field of view to one where she had her first view of the events unfolding before the Western Terrace.\n\nWhen I fell behind that line and I saw, I can just remember my—my breath catching in my throat, because what I saw was just a—a war scene. It was something like I\'d seen out of the movies. I—I couldn\'t believe my eyes. There were officers on the ground. You know, they were bleeding. They were throwing up ... Never in my wildest dreams did I think that, as a police officer, as a law enforcement officer, I would find myself in the middle of a battle. You know, I—I\'m trained to detain, you know, a couple of subjects and—and handle—you know, handle a crowd, but I—I\'m not combat trained.""[44]\n\nPence called for the National Guard\n\n[edit]\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, in videotaped testimony, said the White House encouraged him to claim that Trump had ordered the National Guard to respond on January 6, even though it was Pence who in fact gave the order.[97] Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted on January 6 that former President Trump had ""directed"" the National Guard to respond.[102] The reasons that the White House attempted to falsely credit Trump for National Guard mobilization remains unclear.[103]\n\nIt was always known that Pence gave the order. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher C. Miller had publicly stated so on the day of the attack. As a result, CNN later questioned whether Pence was ""acting as commander in chief.""[102] Miller gave similar testimony to Congress on May 12, 2021, before the House select committee was formed.[104]\n\nSecond hearing – June 13, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nZoe Lofgren – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 19th district)\n\nKevin Marino – attorney for Bill Stepien\n\nChris Stirewalt – former Fox News Political Editor\n\nBenjamin Ginsberg – election attorney, counsel to the George W.

J. Pak testified. Pak resigned from his position days before the January 6 attack; he later told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the White House informed him Trump would fire him if he did not publicly state his office had found election fraud in Georgia.[131][132]\n\nChris Stirewalt, a former Fox News politics editor, testified. Fox News was the first network to declare Biden as having won Arizona in the 2020 election; Stirewalt testified that as the vote count wrapped up, he saw Trump\'s statistical chances of winning shrink to essentially zero. After Stirewalt defended that journalistic choice, Fox News fired him in January 2021.[133][134]\n\nAl Schmidt, the Republican former city commissioner of Philadelphia, testified. He had drawn Trump\'s ire for refusing to publicly announce the city\'s election results were rife with fraud. He resigned in 2021, saying he had received death threats.[131]\n\nBen Ginsberg, a long-term Republican election attorney involved in the controversial Bush v. Gore litigation, testified as an expert about why Trump\'s election lawsuits failed.[135]\n\nSubpoena and absence of Bill Stepien\n\n[edit]\n\nBill Stepien was subpoenaed to testify, but his wife went into labor and he canceled his appearance;[133] his attorney was then to have read a statement on his behalf, but did not.[136] Stepien is a longtime Republican operative who joined Trump\'s 2016 campaign, later becoming the White House political director, before becoming Trump\'s campaign manager two months before the 2020 election. He was involved in the Stop the Steal effort, including spreading false information about voting machines despite a staff memo finding the allegations were false. Stepien had provided the committee a deposition under subpoena in December 2021.[137][138] The Select Committee made ten video clips of Stepien\'s deposition available following the meeting.[109][110][111][112][113][114][115][116][117][118]\n\nKnowledgeable insiders dismiss voter fraud allegations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Select Committee showed several video clips of White House and Trump campaign insiders patly dismissing claims of voter fraud.\n\nTrump adviser Jason Miller said Rudy Giuliani was ""definitely intoxicated"" on election night when he advised Trump to lie that he had won.[139]\n\nTrump campaign staffer Bill Stepien said he disagreed with Giuliani\'s advice on this matter: ""Ballots were still being counted. It was far too early to be making any proclamation like that.""[139] Stepien said that Trump\'s advisers fell into two camps on this matter, and Stepien considered himself to be on ""Team Normal"".[140]\n\nMore video of Barr\'s testimony was presented. At times he could not control his laughter at the absurdity of some fraud allegations, such as the ""Italygate"" conspiracy theory, which claims that satellites controlled from Italy had been compromised and used to attack voting machines, and that former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez had orchestrated an election fraud scheme, despite having died seven years earlier. Barr testified Trump never gave ""an indication of interest in what the actual facts were,"" adding the president had ""become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff."" Barr also laughed at the mention of Dinesh D\'Souza\'s recent film 2000 Mules, dismissing the fictional assertions of widespread election fraud.[141][142]\n\nFalse claims appeared in Trump fundraising\n\n[edit]\n\nCommittee member Zoe Lofgren and the Select Committee\'s senior investigative counsel Amanda Wick described how Trump used false claims of election fraud by a ""left-wing mob"" to solicit donations for an ""Official Election Defense Fund"" beginning days after the election. The solicitation raised some $250 million in total, nearly $100 million in the first week. Lofgren noted most election-related litigation had ended within weeks of the election, yet the requests for cash contributions continued. Reuters analysis of the legal language of the email solicitations days after they began showed that donors were asked to register for recurring donations and that donations under $8,000 would not go into a defense fund, but rather to Trump\'s Save America PAC and to the Republican National Committee, which would have broad discretion over the funds. Lofgren asserted, ""Not only was there the big lie, there was the big rip-off."" Lofgren later said on CNN that the committee had evidence that members of Trump\'s family and inner circle had personally benefited from the post-election fundraising, specifically stating that Kimberly Guilfoyle had been paid $60,000 for delivering a 21⁄2 minute introduction at the Stop the Steal rally, though that fee was paid by Turning Point Action.[143][144][145][146]\n\nThird hearing – June 16, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nPete Aguilar – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 31st district)\n\nGreg Jacob – former Counsel to Vice President Pence\n\nJ.

Pence himself was not present at the hearing and did not offer video testimony.[13]\n\nExperts testimony on the Constitutional role of the Vice President in the election\n\n[edit]\n\nJ. Michael Luttig, a longtime Republican who had clerked for Antonin Scalia and Warren Burger before becoming a federal appeals court judge, testified in-person.[169] Had Pence ""obeyed the orders from his president,"" it ""would have been tantamount to a revolution within a constitutional crisis,"" he said.[170]\n\nBefore the hearing, Luttig wrote a statement for the record that Trump and his allies ""instigated"" a war on democracy ""so that he could cling to power."" He continued, ""It is breathtaking that these arguments even were conceived, let alone entertained by the President of the United States at that perilous moment in history"" and that January 6 ""was the final fateful day for the execution of a well-developed plan by the former president to overturn the 2020 presidential election at any cost."" On the day before the Capitol attack, Luttig had—at the request of Pence\'s aides—publicly opined that the vice president had no constitutional authority to intervene in the election certification, which Pence cited in his January 6 letter stating he would not intervene.[171][172]\n\nGreg Jacob, former counsel to Pence, testified in-person. He had advised Pence he did not have the authority to overturn the election results.[13] In his legal opinion, he said, those who wrote the Constitution wouldn\'t have ""put it in the hands of one person to determine who would be the president of the United States"".[170] He also said that John Eastman had told him privately that he didn\'t expect a single Supreme Court Justice would support the validity of the fake electors scheme.[173]\n\nA video was shown of testimony by Marc Short, former Pence chief of staff.[170] According to Short, Pence knew he had no legal authority to overturn the election and had said so ""many times"" to Trump.[174]\n\nNarrative of Vice President Pence and the events of January 6\n\n[edit]\n\nFormer White House lawyer Eric Herschmann had told the committee that Rudy Giuliani privately admitted on the morning of January 6 that Pence didn\'t have authority to overturn the election, even though Giuliani gave a speech at the Ellipse that afternoon telling the opposite to the crowd. Herschmann\'s videotaped testimony was publicly revealed for the first time.[175]\n\nAccording to a timeline presented by the committee, by 2:10 pm the Capitol had been breached and the mob began swarming in. Trump became aware of the breach and at 2:24 pm tweeted, ""Mike Pence didn\'t have the courage to do what was necessary."" The committee revealed that the mob, some chanting ""hang Mike Pence,"" came within 40 feet (12 m) of the vice president as he was evacuated from his office to an underground loading dock. Greg Jacob testified the Secret Service instructed Pence and his aides to get in cars, which most did; Pence declined, and the head of his security detail assured the vice president he would not be evacuated from the Capitol without his permission. Pence responded that he knew and trusted his security chief, but that he was not the one driving the car. Jacob said Pence did not want the world seeing him fleeing and giving the insurgents any satisfaction from it. Pence then spent the next five hours in a secure underground location within the Capitol Building complex. The Department of Justice spoke to a confidential witness who traveled to Washington with the Proud Boys and swore under oath that they would have killed Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi if given the chance.[176][170][177]\n\nThe committee alleged that Eastman was aware his ""coup memo"" and other legal recommendations and political activities were potentially criminal. He emailed Trump\'s former attorney Rudy Giuliani several days after the attack on the Capitol, saying, ""I\'ve decided I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works"", but he did not receive a pardon.[170] During his taped deposition, he pleaded the Fifth 100 times—reserving the right to avoid self-incrimination—and refused to answer any questions regarding his participation in the attempts to overturn the 2020 election.[178][179]\n\nLuttig warns about 2024\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the close of the hearing, Luttig said:\n\nDonald Trump and his allies and supporters are a clear and present danger to American democracy. They would attempt to overturn that 2024 election in the same way that they attempted to overturn the 2020 election, but succeed in 2024 where they failed in 2020. I don\'t speak those words lightly. I would have never spoken those words ever in my life, except that that\'s what the former president and his allies are telling us ... [that they] are executing that blueprint for 2024 in the open, in plain view of the American public.[180][181]\n\nFourth hearing – June 21, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nAdam Schiff – Committee Member, Representative (D-CA 28th district)\n\nRusty Bowers – Speaker of the Arizona State House of Representatives\n\nBrad Raffensperger – Georgia Secretary of State\n\nGabriel Sterling – Chief Operating Officer in the Georgia Secretary of State Office\n\nWandrea ""Shaye"" Moss – employee of the Department of Registration and Elections in Fulton County, Georgia, from 2017 until 2022\n\n""Lady"" Ruby Freeman – mother of Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss, present in person but heard via pre-recorded testimony\n\nJosh Roselman – investigative counsel for the Select Committee\n\nCasey Lucier – investigative counsel for the Select Committee\n\nWilliam Barr – former Attorney General\n\nB.

The committee presented part of a video deposition of Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, who testified Trump had called her about helping to further the scheme; Eastman also participated in the call.[186][187]\n\nTrump calls the Georgia Secretary of State\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, whose phone call with Trump was cited in the former president\'s second impeachment, testified that his office pursued hundreds of allegations of voter fraud but found no widespread fraud that would have changed the election result. In the end, he found only 74 votes from people who had been ineligible to vote because of felony convictions and only 4 votes in the names of deceased people. There were no votes from underage or unregistered voters.[188] (Biden had won the Georgia election by 11,779 votes.) Gabriel Sterling, Raffensperger\'s deputy, also testified.[14]\n\nDuring the Raffensperger testimony, the committee played audio excerpts of the phone call he had with Trump on January 2, 2021, and another call with Frances Watson, the chief investigative officer for Raffensperger\'s office. Trump told Watson, ""when the right answer comes out you\'ll be praised."" Trump is heard to tell Raffensperger he had won Georgia by at least 400,000 votes, though he actually lost by 11,779 votes. He told Raffensperger, ""I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state."" Trump repeated a debunked allegation that a video showed a suitcase containing a minimum of ""18,000 ballots, all for Biden"" brought to a ballot counting facility late at night for counting. Trump pleaded with Raffensperger to find ""the real truth"" and suggested Raffensperger could be criminally liable if he did not accede to the president\'s wishes:\n\nWhy wouldn\'t you want to find the right answer, Brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? So look, can you get together tomorrow? And Brad, we just want the truth. It\'s simple. And—and everyone\'s going to look very good if the truth comes out. It\'s Ok. It takes a little while, but let the truth come out. And the truth—the real truth is I won by 400,000 votes, at least. So—so what are we going to do here? Because I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break...I think you\'re going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned, the ballots are—are corrupt and they\'re brand new and they don\'t have seals and there\'s a whole thing with the ballots, but the ballots are corrupt and you\'re going to find that they are—which is totally illegal. It\'s—it\'s more illegal for you than it is for them. Because you know what they did and you\'re not reporting it. That\'s a—you know, that\'s a criminal—that\'s a criminal offense. And you know, you can\'t let that happen. That\'s—that\'s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that\'s a big risk.[189]\n\nSurrogates pressured the Arizona House leadership\n\n[edit]\n\nArizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified. Bowers said that Trump had personally pressured him to overturn the state\'s election results, as had Rudy Giuliani, Ginni Thomas,[190] and John Eastman. Bowers said that Eastman told him: ""Just do it and let the courts sort it out."" Bowers characterized Trump\'s scheme as ""cheating"", since there was ""no evidence being presented of any strength"" of the claims. He said that participating in Trump\'s lie would have been ""foreign to my very being."" He also testified that Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs called him on the morning of January 6, asking him to overturn the Arizona results. Shortly before the committee hearing, Trump released a statement saying that Bowers had privately agreed with him in November 2020 that the Arizona election was rigged and stolen, but Bowers specifically denied Trump\'s allegation during the hearing while under oath.[191] Bowers testified Giuliani told him, ""We\'ve got lots of theories. We just don\'t have the evidence.""[186]\n\nSean Riley ""alternate electors"" plan for Wisconsin and Michigan\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Trump fake electors plot\n\nThe committee revealed a text message sent by Senator Ron Johnson\'s chief of staff Sean Riley minutes before the vote certification began on January 6. In the message, Riley informed Pence\'s aide Chris Hodgson that the senator wanted to personally hand deliver information to the vice president about ""alternate slates of electors for MI and WI"" to which Hodgson replied, ""do not give that to him.""[192]\n\nImpact of false fraud allegations on election workers\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorgia election workers Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea\' ArShaye Moss testified about their experiences. After the election, Trump and Giuliani amplified a video that was taken out of context, and used the footage to make baseless claims that Freeman and Moss had committed election fraud. The women and their family members were subjected to anti-Black racist smears and death threats and were warned by the FBI that they would not be safe in their home. During her testimony, Freeman said ""There is nowhere I feel safe. Nowhere. Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States target you?""[193][194] Ms. Moss said that the false accusations made against her had impacted her well-being ""in a major way—in every way—all because of lies.""[195]\n\nReactions to fourth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nFox News anchor Martha MacCallum acknowledged on June 21 after the fourth hearing: ""The lack of [election fraud] evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here, where these [Republican] people are saying, \'Look, I supported you, please give me something to work with,\' and it simply doesn\'t materialize.""[196] Fox News host Brian Kilmeade similarly said on June 26 that Trump\'s allies ""couldn\'t prove"" any cheating had occurred.[197]\n\nBy the fourth hearing, committee members saw an increase in threats against them and were likely to be assigned security details. Kinzinger\'s wife received a handwritten letter that threatened to execute her, her husband and their five-month-old baby.[198]\n\nA month later, on July 20, the Arizona Republican Party censured Rusty Bowers for reasons ""including co-sponsoring Democrat-led bills"" and ""refusing to work with"" Arizona Republicans. They did not directly mention his public testimony at the committee\'s fourth hearing.[199] The state party had censured other leaders the previous year for criticizing Trump.[200]\n\nFifth hearing – June 23, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nAdam Kinzinger – Committee Member, Representative (R-IL 16th district)\n\nSteven Engel – former Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel\n\nJeffrey A.

Miller – former Acting Secretary Of Defense\n\nSynopsis of fifth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fifth televised public hearing focused on Trump\'s pressure campaign to influence top Justice Department officials, demanding they investigate election fraud conspiracy theories and rubber stamp his narrative that the election was stolen, despite any factual evidence to support this claim. The hearing additionally detailed Trump\'s request to seize voting machines in late December 2020; plans to install Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general were also revealed. Witnesses included Jeffrey Rosen, former acting attorney general; Richard Donoghue, former acting deputy attorney general; and Steven Engel, former assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\n""Just say it was corrupt""\n\n[edit]\n\nAt Trump\'s request, acting defense secretary Christopher Miller contacted an attaché in Rome about the debunked QAnon theory which alleged an Italian defense contractor uploaded malware to a satellite in order to hack the election results and remotely switch votes from Trump to Biden. The conspiracy theory was relayed by Congressman Scott Perry to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who then asked Rosen and Donoghue to investigate on behalf of the Department of Justice.[201] They flatly rejected the request as ""patently absurd.""[202] The conspiracy theory was also pushed by former CIA employee Bradley Johnson,[201] who was among those who gave video testimony.[203]\n\nRosen and Donoghue continued to strongly resist Trump\'s efforts to have the Justice Department announce election fraud had been found, just days after outgoing attorney general Bill Barr had resigned and announced that there was no significant evidence found which could have influenced the election.[204] Donoghue testified that during a phone call with then president Trump on December 27, he was told to ""Just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.""[205][206]\n\nOn December 31, Trump rushed back to Washington, D.C., from his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate in order to hold an emergency meeting at the White House, in which Justice Department officials were called upon to attend. At one point, Trump told them that voting machines had been hacked and the election stolen. Trump then asked ""why don\'t you guys seize these machines?"" Richard Donoghue explained that experts at DHS had already investigated and that there was ""nothing wrong with the voting machines ... and no factual basis to seize machines.""[207] Trump then yelled: ""Get Ken Cuccinelli on the phone"" and proceeded to insist that it was his job, as the Homeland Security deputy secretary, to seize voting machines. He told Cuccinelli ""you\'re not doing your job.""[208] During the public hearing, Jeffrey Rosen testified that the Department of Justice has no legal authority to seize voting machines and that he never informed Trump that the Department of Homeland Security could seize voting machines either.[209]\n\nAborted attempt to install Jeffrey Clark as Attorney General\n\n[edit]\n\nClark was shown to have provided a ""proof of concept"" letter, that was composed by John Eastman and Justice Department lawyer Ken Klukowsi, intending that the letter be delivered to Georgia officials. The letter falsely asserted that the Justice Department found election irregularities in that state and others, in an effort to persuade the state legislature to rescind Biden\'s certified victory in Georgia. In response to this proposed letter, a ""contentious"" meeting was held between Clark, Attorney General Rosen, and Deputy Attorney General Donoghue, in which Donoghue told Clark: ""What you are doing is nothing less than the United States Justice Department meddling in the outcome of a presidential election.""[210] When Rosen refused to send the letter, Clark then sought to take over the Department of Justice so that he could send the letter himself.[211]\n\nAccording to The New York Times it was Rep. Scott Perry who had first introduced Trump and Clark, because of Clark\'s ""openness to conspiracy theories about election fraud"" and willingness to do the president\'s bidding.[212] The committee presented text messages from December 26, 2020, between Rep. Perry and Mark Meadows, that revealed the congressman\'s role in the attempted scheme that unfolded days later to oust Rosen and install Clark as the top DOJ official.[213]\n\nWhite House call logs from the afternoon of January 3 showed that officials within the Oval Office were already referring to Clark as the ""Acting Attorney General"" although not having been officially appointed to the position. Later that day, in a meeting at the White House with top Department of Justice officials, Trump openly considered a move to replace Rosen with Clark, saying ""What do I have to lose?"" to which Deputy Attorney General Donoghue replied ""Mr. President, we\'d resign immediately. I\'m not working one minute for this guy, who I just declared was completely incompetent ... I\'m telling you what\'s going to happen. You\'re gonna lose your entire department leadership. Every single one of us will walk out. Your entire department of leadership will walk out within hours.""[214]\n\nUltimately, the effort to appoint Clark, send the letter to Georgia officials, and attempt to decertify election results was averted when a majority of the DOJ Assistant Attorneys General threatened to resign en masse if the scheme went forward.[215][216] During Clark\'s video taped deposition with the committee, he refused to answer most questions, and pleaded the Fifth more than 100 times during his 100-minutes-long interview with investigators.[217]\n\nRequest for preemptive pardons\n\n[edit]\n\nExtracts of a January 11 email sent by Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks were shared. The congressman, who had championed efforts in the House to overturn the election in Trump\'s favor, contacted former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows with pardon requests for himself, Matt Gaetz, Louie Gohmert and ""every Congressman and Senator"" who recently voted to reject official electoral college submissions for Arizona and Pennsylvania.[218][215] White House aides mentioned that Andy Biggs of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania had all requested preemptive pardons.[219][213] Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to Meadows, previously told the committee that Rep. Jim Jordan also talked generally about pardons for members of Congress.[220]\n\nSixth hearing – June 28, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nCassidy Hutchinson – principal aide to President Trump\'s chief of staff, Mark Meadows\n\nCassidy Hutchinson\n\nRichard Donoghue – Former Acting Deputy Attorney General\n\nMax Miller – Deputy Campaign Manager for presidential operations Trump 2020\n\nNick Luna – White House special assistant to the President\n\nKayleigh McEnany – Former White House Press Secretary\n\nMichael Flynn – Former National Security Advisor\n\nMatthew Pottinger – United States Deputy National Security Advisor from September 22, 2019, until January 7, 2021\n\nSynopsis of sixth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sixth televised hearing was dedicated entirely to the testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson, a top aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.[221][222][223] Meadows had provided a large amount of documentation to the committee but then stopped cooperating,[224][225] sued the committee,[226] and was held in criminal contempt of Congress in December 2021.[227]\n\nDue to heightened security concerns surrounding Hutchinson\'s testimony, the committee announced this hearing only one day in advance.[228][229] Ms. Hutchinson obtained her own security prior to her public appearance,[230] and the committee enhanced its security for the sixth hearing at which she testified.[231]\n\nPrelude to January 6\n\n[edit]\n\nHutchinson said that Rudy Giuliani told her on January 2 that Trump and his allies planned to go to the Capitol on January 6. When she reported this to her boss, Meadows, he ""didn\'t look up from his phone and said something to the effect of ... \'things might get real, real bad\'."" The committee also showed prior videotaped testimony in which Hutchinson said the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were mentioned in the context of planning the January 6 rally, especially in Giuliani\'s presence.[232] She said that White House counsel Pat Cipollone tried to prevent anyone from the White House from marching to the Capitol and told her personally: ""Please make sure we don\'t go up to the Capitol, Cass. ... We are going to get charged with every crime imaginable.""[233]\n\nHutchinson said she persuaded Meadows not to go to Giuliani and Eastman\'s ""war room"" at the Willard Hotel on the evening of January 5, where former National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn was also present. Meadows, she said, told her he would instead phone into the meeting.[234]\n\nFlynn was subpoenaed by the committee. During his interview, Rep. Cheney asked: ""General Flynn, do you believe in the peaceful transition of power in the United States of America?"" He pled the Fifth. This video clip was shown at the hearing.[235][236]\n\nHutchinson testified that on the day before the Capitol attack, Trump directed Meadows to contact Flynn and Roger Stone, who both had extensive ties to extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, leaders of which would later be indicted for seditious conspiracy for their alleged roles in the attack.[237]\n\nHutchinson account of January 6\n\n[edit]\n\nTrump had insisted on specific language for his speech at the January 6 rally. Hutchinson recalled legal advice given by Eric Herschmann, who said it would be ""foolish"" to include some of the phrases, such as ""We\'re going to March to the Capitol"" and ""Fight for Trump ... Fight for the movement."" Herschmann also warned against making negative references to Mike Pence.[238][239]\n\nSome people brought weapons, including AR-15s, to Trump\'s speech, according to police radio transmissions.[240] Trump knew the crowd was armed yet wanted security checks loosened; he specifically wanted the magnetometers removed.[241][242][243] Hutchinson, who was present at the rally, testified that she heard Trump say ""something to the effect of \'I don\'t F-ing care that they have weapons. They\'re not here to hurt me.\'"" Meadows and deputy chief of staff for operations Tony Ornato were also aware of the weapons, according to Hutchinson.[232] As the mob became more vocal, calling for Pence to be hanged, Hutchinson overheard a conversation between Cipollone and Meadows, in which Cipollone argued that they needed to act urgently to prevent violence. Meadows, however, reminded Cipollone of Trump\'s current feelings that Pence ""deserves it"" and that Trump ""doesn\'t think they\'re doing anything wrong.""[232]\n\nShe testified that Trump wanted to appear in-person at the Capitol following his speech to supporters. Secret Service agent Robert Engel said it would not be safe to go to the Capitol and insisted on taking him to the White House instead. Hutchinson was told later that day by Tony Ornato that Trump became very angry and insisted he wanted to go to the Capitol.[242] Ornato said Trump grabbed for the steering wheel of the presidential SUV[244] with one hand and lunged at Engel with his other hand, according to Hutchinson.[245][232] She testified that Engel was sitting in a chair, looking ""somewhat discombobulated and a little lost"" while Ornato related the account of these events, and that Engel never contradicted the story.[246][247]\n\nCNN reported three days after Hutchinson\'s testimony that it had spoken with two Secret Service agents who had heard accounts of the incident from multiple other agents since February 2021, including Trump\'s driver. Although details differed, agents confirmed there was an angry confrontation, with one agent relating that Trump ""tried to lunge over the seat—for what reason, nobody had any idea,"" but no one asserted Trump assaulted Engel.[248] Politico reported the same day that Engel told the committee during an early 2022 deposition that he had kept his full account of the incident from his Secret Service colleagues for at least fourteen months.[249]\n\nWhile the committee questioned Hutchinson, they showed brief clips of the videotaped testimony of others. National Security Council records, which identified Trump by his codename ""Mogul,"" also backed Hutchinson\'s claim that security was loosened, and that orders were made to NSC and Secret Service for ""clearing a route"".[250]\n\nImmediate January 6 aftermath\n\n[edit]\n\nHutchinson testified that during the riot she wrote down from Meadows\' dictation a proposed statement the president might release, instructing the insurgents to leave the Capitol. She said White House attorney Eric Herschmann ""chimed in"" with his input. The note was displayed during the hearing, and Hutchinson confirming it was in her handwriting. After the hearing, Herschmann said through a spokesperson that he had written the note.[251]\n\nHutchinson testified that both Meadows and Giuliani sought presidential pardons.[252]\n\nRep. Cheney addresses possible tampering\n\n[edit]\n\nIn closing remarks, Cheney expressed concern that some witnesses may have been given messages intended to influence their testimony. She said a witness, whom she did not name, told the committee they had received multiple such messages prior to giving testimony to the committee: ""What they said to me is, as long as I continue to be a team player, they know that I\'m on the team, I\'m doing the right thing, I\'m protecting who I need to protect, you know, I\'ll continue to stay in good graces in Trump world.""[253] She quoted another unnamed witness being told that ""he is thinking about you"", that ""he knows you\'re loyal"" and ""will do the right thing.""[253] Two days after the hearing, Politico reported that Hutchinson was the recipient of the quoted communications, prior to her March 7 deposition, and that the ""he is thinking about you"" message came from an intermediary for Mark Meadows.[254] Cheney stated that the committee was taking allegations of witness tampering seriously and that they would consider the ""next steps"" necessary to address the issue.[255][256]\n\nOn December 20, 2022, it was reported that Trump administration ethics attorney Stefan Passantino had advised Hutchinson, who was then his client, to testify that she didn\'t remember details. Trump’s Save America PAC was paying for Passantino\'s services, which Hutchinson was not aware of. Hutchinson disagreed with Passantino\'s advice and switched lawyers before she testified.[257][258]\n\nReactions to sixth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nHutchinson’s testimony was subject to significant national attention. According to Time, ""[it] garnered a reaction that no other had received to date. As she exited the hearing room when the committee broke for a short recess, a crowd in the back applauded her.""[259] Fox News host Bret Baier said her ""testimony was very compelling from beginning to end""; conservative commentator George Conway said ""This is the most astonishing testimony I have ever seen or heard or read. You could litigate or investigate for a thousand years and never see anything as mind-blowing as this.""[260] The Lawfare blog editorialized, ""Cassidy Hutchinson\'s Testimony Changed Our Minds about Indicting Donald Trump"".[261] The testimony was widely characterized by legal analysts and the press as highly significant, particularly in the context of possible indictments of Trump and his associates in the Justice Department\'s criminal investigation into attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Former Trump attorney general Bill Barr remarked, ""the department is clearly looking into all this, and this hearing definitely gave investigators a lot to chew on.""[262][263]\n\nAfter Hutchinson\'s testimony, CNN reported that an unnamed ""Secret Service official familiar with the matter"" said Ornato denied telling Hutchinson about a physical altercation. CNN also reported that the DHS Office of Legislative Affairs would make involved agents available to the committee for sworn testimony, at which time they would be prepared to say the incident did not occur.[264] According to Rep. Zoe Lofgren, ""Some of the officers said that they would be coming and talking under oath ... [But] they have not come in"" and instead, Ornato, Engel, and the unnamed driver of the president\'s armored vehicle have all retained legal counsel.[265] (Months later, the committee interviewed the driver.)[266]\n\nOrnato led Trump\'s Secret Service detail until the president named him White House deputy chief of staff for operations in December 2019; Ornato took an unprecedented leave of absence from his civil service Secret Service position to accept the political appointment.[267][268] Politico reported two days after Hutchinson\'s testimony that members of the committee were skeptical of Ornato\'s credibility due to assertions made in his January and March depositions.[269] Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig, author of the 2021 book Zero Fail: The Rise and Fall of the Secret Service, characterized Engel and Ornato as ""very, very close to President Trump."" During an MSNBC interview she stated: ""some people accused them of at times being enablers and \'yes men\' of the president—particularly Tony Ornato—and very much people who wanted to ... see him pleased."" Leonnig said there was a large contingent of Trump\'s Secret Service detail that wanted Biden to fail and some ""took to their personal media accounts to cheer on the insurrection and the individuals riding up to the Capitol as patriots.""[270] Two months after Hutchinson\'s testimony, Ornato, who was then serving as assistant director of the Secret Service, announced his retirement.[271] Ornato then testified to the committee that he didn\'t remember telling Hutchinson about any physical altercation between Trump and the limo driver. The committee wrote in its final report that it was ""difficult to fully reconcile the accounts"" from various witnesses regarding a physical altercation, though witnesses agreed that Trump had been angry.[272]\n\nTrump responded by attacking Hutchinson repeatedly on the Truth Social platform which he owns. He disputed the veracity of many of her statements and called her a ""liar"" and ""total phony.""[260] With regard to Trump\'s denials about Hutchinson\'s testimony, Fox News anchor Bret Baier noted on June 28: ""Cassidy Hutchinson is under oath on Capitol Hill. The President is on Truth Social ... [Her] testimony in and of itself is really, really powerful.""[273]\n\nOn the same day as Hutchinson\'s testimony, anonymous conspiracy theorist ""Q"" posted to 8kun,[274] claiming Hutchinson was involved in a plot to disparage Trump.[275][276] QAnon influencer Jordan Sather called Hutchinson a ""plant"", writing on his Telegram channel: ""Is Cassidy being used as a Trojan Horse to destroy the credibility of these hearings with her obviously fake testimony?""[277]\n\nIn response to the sixth hearing, conservative author David French wrote an article for The Dispatch titled ""The Case for Prosecuting Donald Trump Just Got Much Stronger."" According to The Guardian, ""In French\'s view, Trump demonstrably summoned the mob, knew it was armed and dangerous, told it to \'fight like hell\' and tried to march with it."" French wrote that ""Hutchinson\'s sworn testimony closes a gap in the criminal case ... Trump is closer to a credible prosecution than ever before.""[278][279]\n\nOn the day after Hutchinson\'s testimony, the Washington Examiner, a conservative publication widely read by Trump supporters, published an editorial entitled ""Trump proven unfit for power again."" The paper\'s board wrote, in part, ""Cassidy Hutchinson\'s Tuesday testimony ought to ring the death knell for former President Donald Trump\'s political career ... Trump is a disgrace. Republicans have far better options to lead the party in 2024. No one should think otherwise, much less support him, ever again.""[280][281]\n\nSeventh hearing – July 12, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nJamie Raskin – Committee Member, Representative (D-MD 8th district)\n\nStephanie Murphy – Committee Member, Representative (D-FL 7th district)\n\nJason Van Tatenhove – Former national media director for the Oath Keepers until leaving the group in 2017\n\nStephen Ayres – Participant in the January 6 United States Capitol attack who pleaded guilty to disorderly and disruptive conduct\n\nSynopsis of seventh hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe seventh televised hearing presented links between then-President Donald Trump and the extreme domestic militias that helped coordinate the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.[3][20] The committee and panel of witnesses discussed ""the rise of the right-wing domestic violent extremist groups that attacked the Capitol and how Mr. Trump amassed and inspired the mob.""[3] In addition, the panel described ""known links and conversations between political actors close to Mr. Trump and extremists.""[3] Committee member Jamie Raskin stated, ""Donald Trump solicited the mob; he summoned the mob to Washington ... All of this was targeted on the joint session of Congress.""[3] It focused on testimony from former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, plotting by far-right extremist groups and discussions about using the military to seize voting machines.""[282] Jason Van Tatenhove, who served as media director of Oath Keepers, testified as well.[283][284] The focus of the hearing was connections, including Roger Stone and Michael Flynn, between the Trump administration and militia groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.[285]\n\nIn new disclosed videotaped testimony, Pat Cipollone described, among other things, an ""unhinged"" White House meeting which took place on December 18, 2020, between himself, Trump, Sidney Powell, Michael Flynn and Patrick M. Byrne, who he named as members of an outside group pushing election conspiracy theories, and that they exhibited a ""general disregard for backing what you actually say with facts.""[286] Cipollone testified that during the meeting, a draft executive order which would\'ve directed the U.S. military to seize voting machines was discussed.[287] A former Twitter employee who testified on anonymity also testified that Twitter, which Trump used to help organize the rally, “relished in the knowledge that they were also the favorite and most used service of the former president and enjoyed having that sort of power within the social media ecosystem” and that he was concerned about Trump\'s December 19, 2020, tweet which encouraged people to come to the ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th.""[288] This tweet would lead to further solicitation of the January 6 rally on extremist Internet sources and right wing media.[289] One notable example came from Kelly Meggs, the head of the Florida Oath Keepers, who posted a message on Facebook pledging that his group would ""work together"" with the Three Percenters and Proud Boys, two other right-wing extremist groups, just hours after the tweet was posted.[289] Trump was also revealed to have posted the tweet not long after a meeting with Powell, Flynn and Rudy Giuliani had concluded.[288]\n\nIn videotaped testimony, former White House officials testified about an extremist rally which was held outside the White House at Freedom Plaza the night before the U.S. Capitol attack, which Sarah Matthews described as bringing Trump a good mood.[290] In their videotaped testimonies, former Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia and Ivanka Trump stated that they called on Trump to concede the election after the Electoral College votes were cast in respective states on December 14, 2020, but were ignored.[291][292] Documented draft speeches were also revealed showing that Trump had in fact edited his January 6, 2021, Ellipse speech as well, to include negative words towards Vice President Mike Pence.[290] Important information about Roger Stone\'s direct links to Proud Boys, which included encrypted chats with the Proud Boys Florida leader and video evidence showing him appear with members and reciting the Proud Boys\' ""Fraternity Creed"", would be revealed as well.[293] Kellye SoRelle, a lawyer who assists the Oath Keepers and a volunteer attorney for the Trump campaign, named Stone, Info War\'s Alex Jones, and pro-Trump organizer Ali Alexander as the people who organized the January 2021 Stop the Steal rallies.[293] Footage of Stone, Jones, Alexander and Michael Flynn speaking at the January 5, 2021, Freedom Plaza rally were shown as well.[294]\n\nJason Van Tatenhove, who was first hired by the Oath Keepers in 2014, gave live testimony about the group\'s radicalization and how Stewart Rhodes, the group\'s founder, used conspiracy theories to increase membership and funding, stating that Oath Keepers drifted ""further and further right—into the alt-right world, into White nationalists and even straight-up racists and it came to a point where I could no longer continue to work for them"".[295] He said he finally decided to leave the group was when he heard members talking about how the Holocaust was not real.[295]\n\nA text message which rally organizer Kylie Kremer sent to election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell on January 4, 2021, and which was made public during the hearing, revealed that Trump would ""call for [the march] unexpectedly"" but they didn\'t want word to get out in advance in order to avoid a countermarch.[289] During his live testimony, Ohio resident Stephen Ayres, who participated in the riot despite not being affiliated with any extremist organization, noted how Trump ""got everybody riled up, told everybody to head on down"" and that ""We basically were just following what he said.""[289] Ayres also stated that he did not plan to go to the U.S. Capitol until Trump encouraged the Ellipse crowd to do so.[289]\n\nIn her closing statement, Liz Cheney stated that Donald Trump attempted to contact an unidentified witness who has yet to appear in the hearings, hinting at the possibility of witness tampering: ""That person declined to answer or respond to President Trump\'s call, and instead alerted their lawyer to the call. Their lawyer alerted us. And this committee has supplied that information to the Department of Justice.""[296][297]\n\nEighth hearing – July 21, 2022 – Primetime\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses In pre-recorded testimony In audio visual exhibits\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)[a]\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nAdam Kinzinger – Committee member, (R-Ill 16th district)\n\nElaine Luria – Committee member (D-Va 2nd district)\n\nSarah Matthews – Former Deputy Press Secretary in the President Trump Administration\n\nMatthew Pottinger – Former National Security Aide in the President Trump Administration\n\nMarc Short -

Mark Robinson, a former MPD police officer who was assigned to the presidential motorcade\'s lead TS vehicle on January 6, 2021.[304] Robinson stated that he was told firsthand that Trump got into a ""heated discussion"" about wanting to go to the U.S. Capitol.[304]\n\nSarah Matthews, deputy press secretary in the Trump White House, and Matthew Pottinger,[305] who served on the National Security Council, testified in person. Both had resigned shortly after the attack on the Capitol.[306] Evidence and details were presented of Trump\'s refusal to call off the attack, in spite of numerous pleas from officials, for hours.[307] Never-before-seen footage of Trump\'s January 7, 2021, speech criticizing the January 6 attack was also released which revealed Trump\'s hesitance to make the speech as it was written.[308] Former White House advisor, as well as Trump son-in-law, Jared Kushner stated in videotaped testimony that House of Representatives leader Kevin McCarthy pleaded for White House intervention during a January 6 phone call and that he thought McCarthy was ""scared.""[309] A newly disclosed January 6 text message between Donald Trump Jr. and Mark Meadows revealed that Trump Jr. wanted his father to ""condemn this shit"" and ""go to the mattresses,"" a film reference which Trump Jr. claimed during video testimony he thought meant ""go all in.""[310] Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney stated, ""Every American must consider this ... Can a president who is willing to make the choices Donald Trump made during the violence of Jan. 6 ever be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again?"". Committee Chair Thompson said, ""If there is no accountability for Jan. 6, for every part of this scheme, I fear that we will not overcome the ongoing threat to our democracy ... There must be stiff consequences for those responsible.""[22]\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Cheney said, ""In the course of these hearings, we have received new evidence, and new witnesses have bravely stepped forward ... Doors have opened. New subpoenas have been issued, and the dam has begun to break ... We have considerably more to do. We have far more evidence to share with the American people and more to gather ... So our committee will spend August pursuing emerging information on multiple fronts before convening further hearings this September.""[311]\n\nNinth hearing – October 13, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nZoe Lofgren – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 19th district)\n\nAdam Kinzinger (R-IL 16th)\n\nElaine Luria – Committee member (D-Va 2nd district)\n\nAdam Schiff (D-CA 28th)\n\nStephanie Murphy (D-FL 7th)\n\nJared Kushner - former White House advisor, voice only\n\nBill Stepien - former Trump campaign manager, in video\n\nGreg Jacob - former counsel to Vice President Pence\n\nRoger Stone - Trump outside advisor, in video - pled 5th\n\nJason Miller - former senior campaign staffer, in video\n\nChris Stirewalt - a former Fox News political editor, video of previous January 6th heating.\n\nMark Milley - General, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, voice only.\n\nAlyssa Farah - former White House communications director, in video\n\nCassidy Hutchinson - former aide to Mark Meadows, in video\n\nKeith Kellogg - former national security advisor to Vice President Pence, in video.\n\nJohn McEntee - former director, White House Presidential Personnel, in video.\n\nDouglas Macgregor - former advisor to the Secretary of Defense, in video.\n\nAlex Cannon- former Trump Campaign lawyer, in video.\n\nMatt Morgan - former Trump Campaign lawyer, in video.\n\nMike Pompeo - former Secretary of State, in video.\n\nIvanka Trump - voice only.\n\nWilliam Barr - former Attorney General, in video.\n\nJudd Deere - former White House Deputy Press Secretary, in video\n\nEugene Scalia - former Secretary of Labor, in video\n\nRichard Donoghue – Former Acting Deputy Attorney General\n\nDonald Trump - in video, in audio, and written communications\n\nGreg Jacob - in written memo for Marc Short\n\nTom Fitton - written communications in an email to Molly Michael and Dan Scavino\n\nSteve Bannon - Trump outside advisor, voice and video interviews with media.\n\nRoger Stone - Trump outside advisor, video footage, and written communications\n\nAmy Berman Jackson - Judge, January 6th defendant sentencing hearing\n\nKelly and Connie Meggs - in written documents\n\nMike Pence - former Vice President, in video speech at Federalist Society 4th February 2022\n\nSynopsis of ninth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ninth televised hearing was held October 13, 2022, at 1 pm Eastern time. It was originally scheduled for September 28[312][313] but postponed due to the devastation of Hurricane Ian.[314][315] The hearing focused on evidence and testimony regarding Trump\'s involvement in events surrounding the attack of the Capitol, as well as information on the controversial website ""thedonald.win"", newly released videos of Nancy Pelosi, her Congress members, and lawmakers at their secure location during the attack, newly released videos on the rioters\' reactions to Trump\'s ""go home"" message, and newly released texts from Secret Service agents demonstrating the awareness and warning signals about potential threats to both Pence and Congress in advance of January 6.[27][28][316] The committee was also expecting to vote on its next investigation steps, and unanimously voted to subpoena Trump to make him testify.[27][28][317]\n\nAmong those shown in video testimony footage were former Trump Administration officials Mick Mulvaney and Elaine Chao.[316] Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Washington, also gave video testimony about what she claimed Kevin McCarthy told her about his phone conversation with Trump, which Mulvaney corroborated.[316] Video testimony was also shown of former Twitter employee Anika Navaroli, who was revealed to have previously testified anonymously.[316] Although the committee had already interviewed Ginni Thomas, it didn\'t feature any of her testimony in this public hearing.[318] Video of Roger Stone was also presented, as well as evidence that some Trump associates planned to claim victory in the 2020 election regardless of the official results.[25][26] Stone was also shown endorsing ""the right to violence.""[319]\n\nPrior to the ninth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ninth hearing—which the committee had planned to hold since July[320]—included further details regarding ""the potential unauthorized deletion"" of text messages, particularly those from January 5 and 6, 2021, by the United States Secret Service, which has been headed by Director James M. Murray, a Trump appointee.[321][322][323][324] Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, a Trump appointee, alerted Congress on July 13, 2022, that Secret Service communication records had been deleted, following a months-long delay in reporting the matter.[325][326] According to The Washington Post, the whistleblowers who revealed this delay said they ""shared a concern that Cuffari\'s office not alerting congressional investigators to the missing records reduced the chances of recovering critical pieces of evidence related to the Jan. 6 attack.""[322][327]\n\nOn August 1, 2022, House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson reiterated calls for Cuffari to step down due to a ""lack of transparency"" that could be ""jeopardizing the integrity"" of crucial investigations regarding the missing Secret Service text messages.[328] That same day, an official inside the DHS inspector general\'s office told Politico that Cuffari and his staff are ""uniquely unqualified to lead an Inspector General\'s office, and ... The crucial oversight mission of the DHS OIG has been compromised.""[329] Congress also obtained a July 2021 e-mail, from deputy inspector general Thomas Kait, who told senior DHS officials there was no longer a need for any Secret Service phone records or text messages. Efforts to collect communications related to Jan. 6 were therefore shutdown by Kait just six weeks after the internal DHS investigation began. The Guardian wrote that ""Taken together, the new revelations appear to show that the chief watchdog for the Secret Service and the DHS took deliberate steps to stop the retrieval of texts it knew were missing, and then sought to hide the fact that it had decided not to pursue that evidence.""[330]\n\nText messages from January 6, 2021, were deleted from the phones of Trump-appointed officials at the Pentagon after the watchdog group American Oversight filed FOIA requests to obtain the messages. This was not addressed in the July hearings because it was first reported on August 2.[331][332]\n\nOn August 29, 2022, Representative Kinzinger had stated in a Meet the Press interview that the next public hearings would focus on donations Trump solicited for the ""Stop The Steal"" movement but did not use for that purpose, as well as on the possible Secret Service coverup.[333]\n\nAftermath of the ninth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 2, 2022, Politico reported that they had obtained some of John Eastman\'s e-mail correspondences. The series of messages were from December 31, 2020, and had been turned over to congressional investigators, but had not yet been made public. In one exchange, Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro wrote ""We want to frame things so that Thomas could be the one to issue some sort of stay or other circuit justice opinion saying Georgia is in legitimate doubt"", and posited that Justice Thomas would be their ""only chance to get a favorable judicial opinion by Jan. 6, which might hold up the Georgia count in Congress"". Attorney John Eastman replied ""I think I agree with this"", saying that they needed to ""kick the Georgia legislature into gear"" in order to favor Trump and overturn election results. The plan was to file a lawsuit and have a pending case with the Supreme Court, thus delaying the Senate\'s count of Biden\'s electors. Chesebro wrote that Justice Thomas would be the key figure necessary, if the plan were to succeed, because he would be the justice assigned to dealing with any emergency legal matters sent to the southeastern region\'s Eleventh Circuit court.[334][335]\n\nTrump subpoena\n\n[edit]\n\nThe January 6 Committee\'s subpoena for testimony and related documents was formally issued to Trump on October 21, 2022.[336] Under the subpoena, the committee demanded that Trump hand over documents related to communications with Roger Stone, John Eastman, and others by November 4, and requested testimony by November 14. The committee also specified that they wanted ""information sufficient to identify every telephone or other communications device"" used by Trump between November 3, 2020, and January 20, 2021.[337][338]\n\nOn November 11, 2022, Trump sued the House select committee and challenged the subpoena, seeking to block testimony and submission of documents. Chairman Bennie Thompson has called the legal effort a ""delay tactic"".[339][340][341]\n\nThe committee\'s official legal capacity to conduct their investigation expired on December 31, 2022. Just days before the end of December, the committee formally withdrew Trump\'s subpoena. Chairman Thompson said ""... the select committee has concluded its hearings, released its final report and ... In light of the imminent end of our investigation, the select committee can no longer pursue the specific information covered by the subpoena"".[342]\n\nTenth hearing – December 19, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nSynopsis of tenth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nFull-length video of the tenth and final public hearing of the Select Committee. (Source: January 6th Committee\'s channel on YouTube).\n\nThe tenth and final televised public hearing was held on December 19, 2022, at 1 pm Eastern time. A compilation of video clips, including footage of the riot and witness depositions, was shown.[343]\n\nEach committee member then made a live ""opening statement"":\n\nChairman Thompson confirmed that the final report will be released later in the week, and that the report will have ""a bulk"" of the select committee\'s findings.\n\nVice Chair Cheney elaborated on the history and importance of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nRep. Lofgren summarized the details regarding the ""Big Lie"" tactics.\n\nRep. Schiff outlined the details of Trump\'s interference at the state level, Trump\'s fake electors plan, and the targeting of election workers.\n\nRep Kinzinger detailed regarding the DOJ pressure campaign by Trump and his allies, including to the January 3rd attempt of appointing Jeffrey Clark as acting Attorney General of the DOJ.\n\nRep. Aguilar reviewed Trump\'s pressure campaign on state officials, Congress, and even Vice-President Pence to take ""unlawful action"" in overturning the election results.\n\nRep. Murphy discussed how Trump summoned the crowd to Washington, D.C., on January 6 and how his tweets ""galvanized"" violent extremists.\n\nRep. Luria recapped Trump\'s 187 minutes of inaction and dereliction of duty.\n\nRep. Raskin elaborated on the subcommittee\'s work and their consideration, reasoning, and evidence for criminal referrals. They recommended that Trump be charged with four crimes:[344] 18 U.S.C § 1512(c),[345] 18 U.S.C § 371,[346] 18 U.S.C § 1001,[347] and 18 U.S.C § 2383.[348] (These are: Obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement and ""incite,"" ""assist"" or ""aid or comfort"" an insurrection.)[349][350] Raskin also stated that the subcommittee\'s work had been limited by the lack of cooperation, and hopes the DOJ can use the subcommittee\'s work for their own investigation.\n\nThe committee also referred John Eastman.[351]\n\nNewer, previously un-televised video testimony from Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway was shown as well.[352] In her testimony, Hicks, who was Trump\'s White House communications director, claimed that Trump at one point told her ""something along the lines of \'nobody will care about my legacy if I lose ... the only thing that matters is winning.\'""[353] Conway, in her testimony, claimed that she briefly spoke with Trump the day after the Capitol attack and that he said his supporters were upset.[354]\n\nThe committee also recommended that the House Ethics Committee follow up on Rep. Kevin McCarthy (California), Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), Scott Perry (Pennsylvania), and Andy Biggs (Arizona) refusing to answer subpoenas.[31]\n\nImmediately after the hearing, the committee released a 154-page executive summary of its findings.[33][34][35] It said it was ready to release its final report. The vote of the committee was unanimous.[349][350]\n\nMedia coverage\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, ""The eight hearings held by the House committee investigating the ... attack on the U.S. Capitol have been riveting to watch—and even more remarkably, they have captured the daily news cycle again and again, not only finding substantial TV and streaming audiences as they aired but also consistently landing at the top of broadcast and cable news reports and of newspaper front pages."" The Post referenced several factors for the popularity of the hearings, stating that ""Each hearing has produced at least one legitimate nugget of actual news, and sometimes more than one."" They cited the importance of the brisk pace of the hearings which ""move[d] expeditiously from brief opening statements to video or live testimony"" and without extemporaneous speeches or tedious delays. Liz Cheney was called ""a compelling central character"" with ""steely resolve and understated intensity"" who ""is hard to look away from."" The Post also gave some importance to timing, saying that ""other major news stories of recent months ... have not occurred on the same dates as the hearings themselves.""[355]\n\nAccording to CNN, ""the committee has certainly succeeded in keeping the attention of America\'s political junkies. Trump devotees are the exception to that rule, but even they have dropped the \'nobody\'s watching the hearings\' talking point that was trotted out in June. In a streaming and on-demand world, the total reach of the hearings to date is unknowable, but many tens of millions of Americans have soaked up the committee\'s findings, which is no small thing in a fractured media space.""[356]\n\nJune 9, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nJune 9 viewership[357] Network Viewers ABC 5,215,000 MSNBC 4,303,000 NBC 3,696,000 CBS 3,490,000 FNC 3,062,000 CNN 2,740,000 FBN 223,000 CNBC 158,000 Newsmax 137,000 NewsNation 125,000\n\nBroadcast networks Cable news networks\n\nThe first public hearing of 2022 was carried live by all the major networks except Fox News.[358] Mediated live coverage was provided by major broadcast television networks ABC, CBS and NBC, as well as cable channels such as C-SPAN, CNN, Fox Business Network, MSNBC, and Newsmax, as well as news organizations such as The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Television, and ABC TV (Australian TV channel), and free streaming channels such as NBC News NOW, and LiveNOW from Fox via YouTube and other live streaming outlets.[4][359] Nielsen Media Research estimates that at least 20 million households watched the first hearing on traditional television, comparable to the average rating for NBC Sunday Night Football, which ranks as television\'s number one program.[360]\n\nFox News alternate coverage during hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nInstead of airing the hearing live, the Fox broadcast network stuck with repeats of its regularly scheduled programming, while Fox News broadcast Tucker Carlson Tonight and Hannity without commercial breaks for the entire two-hour hearing.[361] During Carlson\'s show, he repeated false claims[362][363] about FBI involvement,[364] stating that federal agents had instigated the violence during the January 6 riots.[365]\n\nOn Sean Hannity\'s show, he referred to the January 6 House Select Committee hearing as a ""boring ... Hollywood production"" and blamed the Capitol Police for their inability to defend the U.S. Capitol Building and prevent mob violence.[366]\n\nThe New York Times observed that by ""not carrying the hearings live in prime time"" Fox News was able to avoid a potentially ""awkward on-screen moment.""[367] During the weeks following the 2020 election, Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity promoted Trump\'s election fraud narrative.[368][369] Previously disclosed text messages between Hannity and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany were presented during the hearing, which revealed a coordinated internal strategy and agreed-upon public messaging campaign with the Fox News host.[370][371][372][further explanation needed]\n\nNPR\'s David Folkenflik said coverage of the hearing would have required Fox News to ""broadcast flat contradictions of what many leading Fox News personalities have told their audiences in the past year and a half.""[361] Chris Hayes, of MSNBC, condemned Fox News saying they ""went to great lengths"" by not airing the hearing and that the network simultaneously countered the findings of the House Select Committee investigation by doing ""everything in their power to make sure their viewers were shielded from the brutal truth about the violent coup that Donald Trump fomented.""[358] For example, Hayes said their skipping of commercial breaks would cost the network unknown thousands of dollars but tended to keep viewers from switching to the other networks, where they would have found live hearing coverage.[358]\n\nJuly 21, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nThe eighth public hearing of 2022—and the second to be aired live on primetime—had nearly 17.7 million viewers.[373] After his video testimony aired, Donald Trump Jr., who testified that he was among those tried to encourage his father to denounce the attack on the U.S. Capitol, was greatly mocked on social media for misinterpreting what The Godfather\'s line ""go to the mattresses"" meant;[374] Newsweek journalist Tom Norton even noted that ""Such descriptions arguably paint Trump in the same brush strokes as a crime boss.""[310]\n\nTelevised production and viewership\n\n[edit]\n\nThe United States House Select Committee contracted James Goldston, former president of ABC News, as an advisor to help produce the public hearings and present the findings with a polished televised format.[375][376] According to the Nielsen ratings, ""In total, each of the eight hearings averaged 13.1 million viewers ... The two prime time hearings averaged 18.9 million viewers per hearing, and the other six hearings, which were daytime broadcasts, averaged 11.2 million viewers per hearing.""[377]\n\nNewspaper coverage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe New York Times presented a detailed summary of the eight hearings held in June and July 2022.[22] A ninth hearing was convened in October.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.koin.com/news/called-a-martyr-by-some-capitol-rioter-ashli-babbitts-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/', 'Headline': 'Called a martyr by some, Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt’s past tells a ...', 'Snippet': 'In 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.', 'Full_text': ''}}",98.33333333333333,1

Advertisement', 'Full_text': 'You may be hearing the phrase “fake electors scheme” a lot lately—in fact, just this week, 16 people in Michigan were charged with a slew of felonies because of it. The “scheme” has also been under investigation by the Department of Justice since last year. But what exactly is it?\n\nIt’s a plan allegedly devised by Donald Trump, his lawyers, and his advisers to overturn the 2020 election results and keep Trump in the White House for another term, despite Joe Biden winning the general election.\n\nThe details are a bit convoluted. We’re here to fill you in.\n\nPart I: Seed Doubt\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2020 election, there were signs that Trump might not accept an election loss. When asked, Trump wouldn’t commit to a peaceful transfer of power. Instead, he seeded doubt in the integrity of the U.S. voting system, specifically mail-in ballots. “I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster. Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very peaceful—there won’t be a transfer, frankly, there’ll be a continuation,” said Trump. Around that time, a group of bipartisan experts had produced a white paper laying out scenarios of how Trump could react to an election loss, predicting a constitutional crisis. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also warned the country of a “nightmare scenario” where Trump refused to step down from the presidency despite losing the election.\n\nSure enough, as it became clear in the days and weeks following the Nov. 3, 2020, election that Biden was going to become the next U.S. president, Trump’s camp began to target seven battleground states—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—where Biden had won. According to evidence presented during the House Jan. 6 committee hearings, Trump adviser Kenneth Chesebro was the one to initially suggest this plan, and he pulled in attorneys John Eastman, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and other Trump allies like chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn to help execute it.\n\nPart II: Lawsuits and Demands for Recounts\n\nTrump and his allies launched 62 legal challenges in battleground states. But 61 failed; one Pennsylvania judge ruled that voters couldn’t go back and “cure” their ballots, if they had failed to provide proper identification, within three days after the election. The decision didn’t change Biden’s victory in Pennsylvania.\n\nUndeterred, the Trump camp asked for the support of local Republican officials, who are in charge of facilitating their local elections. Trump infamously called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and demanded he “find 11,780 votes,” the exact number needed to win over Biden. Trump also personally contacted the speaker of the Pennsylvania House, Bryan Cutler, to request his help in reversing his state’s election results.\n\nGiuliani also addressed the Georgia Legislature in an attempt to convince them that Georgia’s election results had been skewed by fraud. Meadows traveled to Georgia to watch an audit of absentee ballots and sent the Department of Justice multiple emails alleging voter fraud and requesting investigations be started.\n\nPart III: Assemble Electors\n\nBefore an election, political parties in each state choose their electors—the people who will represent them in the Electoral College, should their candidate win. Most states award all of their electors to the party that earns the most votes, except for Nebraska and Maine, which send a proportional distribution of electors from both parties.\n\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, all the electors gather in their respective states to officially enter their votes for president. They record the vote on an official certificate, called the Certificate of Ascertainment, which they send to Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Constitution does not actually require electors to vote according to their state’s popular vote, but since the winning party got to choose them in advance, it’s pretty rare for them not to. Some states have also passed laws that penalize “faithless electors.”\n\nThis process usually runs smoothly, but there have been instances of trouble.\n\nIn 1960, when Sen. John F. Kennedy was running against Vice President Richard Nixon, the race was so tight that the Kennedy campaign demanded a recount in Hawaii, despite Nixon winning the state. As the recount took place, both campaigns organized their chosen slates of electors and sent signed certificates to Congress. Once the recount finished, Hawaii flipped for Kennedy, which then sent a second round of official electors and a new certificate to Washington, D.C.\n\nAs vice president, Nixon was also president of the Senate, and faced three different slates of electors, but chose to honor Kennedy’s.\n\nThe Trump campaign argued this set a precedent for them to object to states’ election results and put forth their own slates of electors. Though their excuse for doing so—the claims of voter fraud—had been widely disproven, the Trump campaign allegedly played a hand in assembling a hodgepodge of local Republicans in each of the seven battleground states to serve as fake electors.\n\nRepublican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel testified before the Jan. 6 Commission that Trump called her asking for the RNC’s help in gathering pro-Trump electors across the country. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers also said Trump pressured him to reconvene the Arizona Legislature and recall electors who were going to vote for Biden (Bowers refused).\n\nAt the time, however, the government’s top cybersecurity agency refuted Trump’s allegations of widespread voter fraud. And Trump’s own attorney general, Bill Barr, rejected the claims as “bullshit.” A Department of Justice investigation completed in 2022 also ultimately found no evidence of fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election.\n\nEven states that were more forgiving to Trump could not stand by his claims. The state of Georgia went through three rounds of recounts and Biden remained the clear winner every time. The same goes for Arizona, which held a hand recount of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County and found Biden actually gained 99 more votes.\n\nAlthough many Republican officials across all seven states refused to bend to Trump’s demands, Trump supporters in all seven battleground states, who had no authority to act as state electors, still signed fake certificates declaring Trump as their state’s winner and sent them to the National Archives.\n\nPart IV: Convince the Vice President\n\nAll of these efforts would be futile unless the vice president would play along. On Jan. 6, 2021, Mike Pence, in his capacity as president of the Senate, was scheduled to preside over the receiving and counting of electoral ballots. It’s mostly a ceremonial role, but Trump and his allies were convinced Pence had the authority to throw out the legitimate electoral votes for Biden and only count Trump’s fake ones, though the law does not explicitly grant him that authority.\n\nThe pressure campaign culminated in the days before the attack on the Capitol. Testimony from the House Jan. 6 committee revealed that Eastman, one of Trump’s lead lawyers, told Pence directly in an Oval Office meeting, “I’m here to request that you reject the electors.”\n\nPence did not oblige Eastman’s request, and days later, on Jan. 6, an angry mob of Trump supporters chanted “Hang Mike Pence.” Trump allegedly said the vice president “deserves it.”\n\nIn the end, the fake electors were not considered in Congress—despite an aide for Republican Sen. Ron Johnson attempting to hand them to Pence minutes before the electoral vote count started—and soon enough the world learned of Trump’s plan.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nAmerican Oversight, a progressive watchdog group, reported on this plan in March 2021 when, through a records request, they got their hands on copies of phony electoral vote certificates from the seven battleground states. Almost a year later, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow also revealed the scheme on her show.\n\nThen came the House Jan. 6 committee, which, through a series of public hearings, revealed some pretty shocking details. For example, when Bowers, Arizona’s governor, testified, he alleged that Republican Rep. Andy Biggs called him the morning of Jan. 6 to try to convince him to sign on to a fake slate of electors, a request he refused.\n\nThe committee voted to refer Trump to the DOJ on at least four criminal charges, handing over all of its evidence and transcripts. That’s when the department decided to appoint special counsel Jack Smith to investigate whether any person or entity unlawfully interfered with the transfer of power following the 2020 election or the Electoral College vote certification. And now that Trump has received a target letter in the investigation, it seems another indictment is going to come any day now.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/21/us/jan-6-hearing-trump/rusty-bowers-arizona-trump-jan-6', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Hearings Day 4: Panel Ties Trump to False Electors Plan - The ...', 'Snippet': 'An aide to Senator Ron Johnson tried to arrange for the senator to provide fake electors from Michigan and Wisconsin to Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021. ... of Arizona’s electors for ...', 'Full_text': 'The hearing demonstrated the human costs of the waves of threats and intimidation set off by Mr. Trump and his supporters as they pressured state officials and election workers to find a way to deprive Joseph R. Biden Jr. of his victory.\n\nHere are four takeaways.\n\nTrump was directly involved in the ‘fake electors’ plan.\n\nThe committee showed evidence that Mr. Trump was directly involved behind the scenes in trying to put forward the alternate slates of Trump electors that he hoped could replace the electors awarded to Mr. Biden through his victories in swing states like Arizona and Georgia.\n\nMr. Trump called Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, to ask her to talk to one of his outside lawyers, John Eastman, who was on the line, about the plan, Ms. McDaniel said in a video clip of her deposition to the committee. Mr. Trump wanted Ms. McDaniel, she said, to talk to Mr. Eastman “about the importance of the R.N.C. helping the campaign gather these contingent electors” if Mr. Trump’s legal challenges were successful.\n\nAs Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman were undertaking the scheme, the White House Counsel’s Office held a meeting with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani; the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and other aides, where they were told that the plan was not legally sound, according to recorded testimony from a West Wing aide, Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nThe committee did not say whether Mr. Trump was told about the meeting with the White House Counsel’s Office. Last week, the panel revealed that Mr. Trump had been told by Mr. Eastman that the broader effort they were pursuing to convince Vice President Mike Pence to block or delay certification of the Electoral College count in Mr. Biden’s favor had no legal basis — a fact that legal experts say could help prosecutors build a criminal case against Mr. Trump.\n\nG.O.P. elected officials pushed the electors scheme.\n\nThe committee showed that Republicans in Congress were pushing the alternate electors plan even on Jan. 6, hours before the day’s violence, which had the effect of stopping the certification of the electoral count as Mr. Pence was whisked away from the mob.\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, told an aide for Mr. Pence on Jan. 6 that Mr. Johnson wanted to give Mr. Pence a list of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, two states won by Mr. Biden.\n\n“Johnson needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise,” Sean Riley, an aide to Mr. Johnson, texted an aide to Mr. Pence, according to messages released by the committee.\n\n“What is it?” Chris Hodgson, the aide to Mr. Pence, replied.\n\n“Alternate slate of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Mr. Riley said.\n\n“Do not give that to him,” Mr. Hodgson texted back.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Johnson, Alexa Henning, said on Twitter that he “had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office.”\n\nThe communications with the vice president’s office, she said, were “staff to staff” and the documents were never sent to Mr. Pence.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, another Trump ally on Capitol Hill, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, reached out to Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and a Republican, to see if he would support the decertification of Arizona’s electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Mr. Bowers recounted telling Mr. Biggs.\n\nTrump’s allies could not produce evidence of election fraud.\n\nThe committee showed examples of how Mr. Trump and his allies knew that there was no evidence that the election had been stolen.\n\nMr. Bowers recounted how Mr. Giuliani acknowledged to him at one point in a phone call that they could not find the evidence of fraud that they needed.\n\n“He said, ‘We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence,’” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani telling him. “And I don’t know if that was a gaffe or maybe he didn’t think through what he said, but both myself and others in my group, the three in my group and my counsel, both remembered that specifically, and afterwards, we kind of laughed about it.”\n\nAt another point, Mr. Eastman was pressing Mr. Bowers to embrace the plan to push a slate of Trump electors from Arizona despite the state’s certification of Mr. Biden’s victory there. Mr. Bowers said that he questioned how he could legally participate in the scheme and that Mr. Eastman responded by saying, “Just do it and let the courts sort it out.”\n\nThreats and intimidation started well before Jan. 6.\n\nThe public pressure that Mr. Trump and his allies put on state election officials resulted in the officials being targeted in frightening and intimidating ways by Trump supporters.\n\nShaye Moss, an elections worker in Fulton County, Ga., who, along with her mother, had been falsely accused by Mr. Giuliani of committing election fraud, provided a dramatic portrait of the harassment that Mr. Giuliani’s false claims had spawned. She described the racist messages she received on Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me, telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, ‘Be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Ms. Moss said.\n\nShe said that the entire episode, and the attention that came with it, had “turned my life upside down.”\n\n“I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” she said. “I don’t want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something. I don’t go to the grocery store at all. I haven’t been anywhere at all. I’ve gained about 60 pounds. I just don’t do nothing anymore. I don’t want to go anywhere.”\n\nShe said she loved her job as an election worker but ultimately quit.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, recounted how the home of his son’s widow had been broken into.\n\nMr. Bowers was the target of protests and threats as his daughter was dying. And he described how his office had received over 20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voice mail messages and texts that made it impossible for him and his staff to communicate.\n\n“It is the new pattern or a pattern in our lives to worry what will happen on Saturdays because we have various groups come by and they have had video panel trucks with videos of me proclaiming me to be a pedophile and a pervert and a corrupt politician and blaring loudspeakers in my neighborhood,” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nChris Cameron contributed reporting.\n\nNeither Mr. Holder nor the committee has disclosed the contents of the full trove of videos, and neither has commented on whether it provides substantial new information about Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss.\n\nBut the small piece of it seen by The Times was striking for how it shows Ms. Trump using a different tone in describing her father’s efforts to overturn the outcome than she did in the portion of her deposition to the House committee that has been made public so far.\n\nThe interview for the documentary was conducted on Dec. 10, 2020, the person with access to the video said. That was nine days after a public statement by Attorney General William P. Barr, who declared at the time that there was no widespread fraud impacting the election’s outcome, a rare public rebuke of Mr. Trump’s claims at the time.\n\nIn her recorded interview with the House committee, Ms. Trump said that Mr. Barr’s comments “affected my perspective.”\n\n“I respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he said,” she said. The committee may release additional video of her recorded testimony.\n\nPeople close to Ms. Trump have insisted that she had distanced herself from what was taking place around her father at that time. Those people have said that, after the race was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Trump began focusing on winding down her office and looking toward a new life in Miami.\n\nYet in the video with the filmmaker, Ms. Trump, describing her father’s gains in votes among key demographic groups, had a different reaction when asked whether she had a “take” on her father’s “very clear position on the results and what’s going on.”\n\n“I think that, as the president has said, every single vote needs to be counted and needs to be heard, and he campaigned for the voiceless,” Ms. Trump replied. “And I think a lot of Americans feel very, very disenfranchised right now, and really, question the sanctity of our elections, and that’s not right, it’s not acceptable.”\n\nShe went on, “And he has to take on this fight. Look, you fight for what you love the most and he loves this country and he loves this country’s people, and he wants to make sure that their voice is, is heard and not muted.”\n\nShe said that he “will continue to fight until every legal remedy is exhausted and that’s what he should do.”\n\nAn aide to Ms. Trump did not respond to a message about the new video.\n\nThe filmmaker was connected to Mr. Kushner by Jason Greenblatt, a former lawyer at the Trump Organization and then the White House envoy to the Middle East. The film was envisioned as a legacy project for Mr. Trump, according to two people familiar with how it came about.\n\nMr. Bowers, who spoke about the Constitution in reverential and spiritual terms, had tears in his eyes as he described his gravely ill daughter enduring some of the harassment outside their house. (She died in late January.)\n\n“It was disturbing,” he said. “It was disturbing.”\n\nThe effort to persuade him to take steps to flip the outcome in Arizona to Mr. Trump’s column — the state was won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. — began with pressure from Mr. Trump, and one of his lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who maintained that he had evidence of fraud. “Aren’t we all Republicans here? I would think we would get a better reception,” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani saying at one point.\n\nSoon after Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, certified the state for Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani and an associate, Jenna Ellis, met with Arizona lawmakers, including Mr. Bowers, Mr. Bowers recalled. Mr. Bowers described Ms. Ellis asserting that they had evidence of widespread voter fraud, only to provide none.\n\n“I said, ‘I want the names. Do you have the names of the supposedly dead or fraudulent voters?’” Mr. Bowers said. “She said, ‘Yes.’”\n\nNothing was produced. Eventually, he recalled, Mr. Giuliani said, “We’ve got lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”\n\nMr. Bowers also recalled speaking to Mr. Trump, making clear to the president that he “wouldn’t do anything illegal for him,” as one questioner, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said. Nonetheless, another lawyer advising Mr. Trump, John Eastman, called Mr. Bowers in early January and urged him to schedule a legislative vote to “decertify the electors, because we had plenary authority to do so.”\n\nMr. Eastman, Mr. Bowers testified, said that he should “just do it and let the courts figure it all out.”\n\nMr. Bowers again rejected the push, saying, “I took an oath — for me to take that, to do what you do would be counter to my oath.”\n\nFinally, he testified, there was a call from another Trump supporter, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, when the Electoral College vote was to be confirmed by a joint session of Congress. Mr. Biggs, he said, pushed him again to undo the state’s certification of its electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“We have no legal pathway” to “execute such a request,” Mr. Bowers recalled saying. He also recalled his reaction when he learned that Trump advisers pushed ahead with a scheme to put forward slates of “alternate” electors. “I thought of the book, ‘The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,’” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nMr. Bowers’s personal journal contained an entry in which he said, “I do not want to be a winner by cheating. I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” He was invited to read it into the testimony.\n\nHe was also asked for his reaction to a statement from Mr. Trump criticizing Mr. Bowers’s testimony in advance, in which he claimed that Mr. Bowers had told him the election was “rigged” and that he had won the state.\n\n“I did have a conversation with the president,” Mr. Bowers said. “That certainly isn’t it.”\n\nA moment later, more emphatically, he said, “Anywhere, anyone, any time has said that I said the election was rigged — that would not be true.”'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rusty-bowers-arizona-election-results-david-farnsworth-january-6/', 'Headline': 'Rusty Bowers, Arizona House speaker who testified at Jan. 6 hearing ...', 'Snippet': ""The hearing focused on a plan by Trump's allies to put forward alternate electors that supported Trump in seven battleground states in the 2020 election that President Biden won, including Arizona."", 'Full_text': 'Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican who testified at a House Jan. 6 committee hearing about former President Donald Trump\'s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, lost his bid in Tuesday\'s GOP primary for a state Senate seat to a Trump-backed candidate, CBS News projects.\n\nFormer state Sen. David Farnsworth was leading with 64% of the vote to Bowers\' 36% as of Wednesday morning, according to the Arizona secretary of state\'s office. Trump supported Farnsworth in the race, and blasted Bowers as a ""RINO coward"" at a rally last month.\n\nBowers testified on June 21 before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The hearing focused on a plan by Trump\'s allies to put forward alternate electors that supported Trump in seven battleground states in the 2020 election that President Biden won, including Arizona.\n\nBowers resisted that effort, telling the committee that the scheme to replace Mr. Biden\'s electors with a fake slate for Trump was a ""tragic parody.""\n\nEarlier this year, Bowers helped block a bill to empower the legislature to choose its own electors, regardless of how the people voted.\n\nBowers has been a Republican for 30 years.

He also agreed to turn over all emails and text messages to prosecutors.\n\nNow he’s apparently coming clean about his part in the conspiracy elsewhere.\n\nHis testimony could be key in Arizona\n\nNevada is the third state to bring criminal charges against its fake electors, following Michigan and Georgia.

Mark Finchem, one of the state’s loudest stop the stealers, came to be hand carrying the lawmakers’ request to Washington on Jan. 5, 2021, putting it into the hands of one of Trump’s strongest acolytes on Capitol Hill, Rep. Andy Biggs.\n\nOr how Biggs came to be videoconferencing with Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, asking him to sign onto the legislators’ request and support the decertification of Arizona’s vote.\n\nBowers declined.\n\nBiggs went forth anyway, joining with Reps. Paul Gosar, Debbie Lesko and more than 140 esteemed members of Congress to reject Arizona’s vote.\n\nYou begin to understand those reports that Biggs sought a presidential pardon, though he denies it.\n\nArizona’s fake electors have mostly laid low since details of this scam on America have trickled out. Their enablers and supporters insist they were merely a backup plan, casting Arizona’s electoral votes for Trump in the event that lawsuits challenging the election were successful.\n\nFake electors, beware: A Trump ally is ready to come clean\n\nThat might actually work if we were in Pennsylvania or New Mexico, where the Trump electors added that caveat to the official certifications they sent to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nIn New Mexico, the Trump electors signed, “on the understanding that it might later be determined that [they] are the duly elected and qualified Electors.”\n\nIn Pennsylvania, they said their votes for Trump should count only “if, as a result of a final non-appealable court order or other proceeding prescribed by law, we are ultimately recognized as being the duly elected and qualified electors.”\n\nMayes should broaden her investigation\n\nBut Arizona’s fake electors offered no such hedge. They signed documents simply declaring themselves “duly elected and qualified electors” and casting their votes for the guy who didn’t win.\n\nMe? I’m hoping Mayes will broaden her investigation to look beyond the 11 “electors” who so proudly put their name to a fake document.\n\nThis wasn’t just 11 rubes who decided on a whim to protest Biden’s win by casting a symbolic electoral vote for Trump.\n\nThis was a carefully planned scheme, meticulously coordinated — from the seeds of doubt deeply planted to erode trust in our elections to the fake electors who were part of a plot to steal the vote in Arizona and other swing states to the storming of the nation’s Capitol to stop Joe Biden from becoming president.\n\nI’m guessing Kenneth Chesebro knows exactly what happened here, and on Monday he’ll be in Phoenix.\n\nThat thump you just heard? I picture Arizona’s fake electors dropping into a dead faint.\n\nReach Roberts at laurie.roberts@arizonarepublic.com.

The federal indictment of Trump said this was part of a criminal conspiracy aimed at keeping him in office.\n\nThe Michigan electors were each charged with eight felonies and released on $1,000 bonds.\n\nAt least eight of the 16 fake electors in Georgia have been offered immunity.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes\' office has said Arizona\'s electors are under investigation. The office declined further comment Friday.\n\nJoshua Stanton, counsel at Perry Law who is based in Washington, D.C., said that it’s not just the fake electors who face jeopardy, but those who might have misled those people before they signed the documents claiming to be the rightful electors.\n\n“There is significant evidence that a lot of these false electors it seems across the country were aware that Trump had definitely lost, that his litigation attempts were bogus, and that this was really being used as part of an effort, an illegal effort, to overturn the election,"" said Stanton, who clerked at U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.\n\nAt a previous firm he represented recording artists, professional athletes, actors and business executives.\n\nHe said prosecuting the electors might depend on what they were told by people working with Trump to overturn the election, and whether they thought they were only to be used if the elections in those states were overturned by the courts for some reason. They in fact were used even though court challenges to overturn the state elections all failed.\n\n“If the false electors, when they signed that form, honestly believed that (they would only be used if the GOP won in court), then it seems likely that they didn’t do anything wrong,” Stanton said. “It would be hard to actually prosecute them.”\n\nNone of the Arizona GOP representatives who signed false documents contacted by The Arizona Republic in recent months have agreed to talk on the record.\n\nStanton said it’s possible prosecutors already have evidence to show they knew the documents would be sent to Congress even if the courts didn\'t overturn the state elections. It appears the co-conspirators named in the indictment didn\'t plan to use the fake electors only as a contingency.\n\n“Even if the false electors themselves maybe potentially avoid liability, there are a number of people at the higher levels that could face charges in Arizona,” Stanton said.\n\nHe said that based on what is known publicly so far, charges could still come from the federal or state level for those people.\n\nThe indictment seems to offer an out to the false electors by stating they were misled by people trying to help Trump overturn the election.\n\n“It’s not necessarily the false electors who could end up getting indicted,"" Stanton said. ""It’s the folks who maybe misled them.""\n\nElection exodus: The exodus of Arizona election officials continues. This time, it\'s in ruby-red Mohave County\n\nStanton referenced emails from Arizona lawyer Jack Wilenchik, reported last year in The New York Times, including one in which Wilenchik referred to the electors as ""fake.""\n\n“We would just be sending in ‘fake’ electoral votes to Pence so that ‘someone’ in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the ‘fake’ votes should be counted,” Wilenchik wrote in a Dec. 8, 2020, email to Boris Epshteyn, a strategic adviser for the Trump campaign, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik later wrote that “alternative” was a better term than “fake.”\n\nWilenchik also wrote the idea that it could launch an objection in Congress to certifying the vote for Biden, and acknowledged that the electors\' votes should not count, according to another email reported by the Times.\n\n“His idea is basically that all of us (GA, WI, AZ, PA, etc.) have our electors send in their votes (even though the votes aren’t legal under federal law — because they’re not signed by the Governor); so that members of Congress can fight about whether they should be counted on January 6th,” Wilenchik wrote in the email on Dec. 8, 2020, to Epshteyn and others, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik told The Arizona Republic on Friday that in those emails he was only offering an opinion on the plan for Trump\'s campaign staff when asked, and he believed the actions were legal.\n\n""I believed then and I believe now it is completely legal, as do a number of legal scholars,"" Wilenchik said. ""There is no crime I can even conceive of here.""\n\nHe referenced recent comments from legal scholar Alan Dershowitz supporting the idea that submitting alternate electors is the proper way to protest an election.\n\nDershowitz, a nationally recognized constitutional lawyer, recently said during a FOX News appearance that submitting the alternate electors was the proper way to address state elections where the rightful winner is undecided.\n\n""The way you protest an election is to come up with an alternate slate of electors. That was done in 1960,"" Dershowitz said, referencing the race in Hawaii that year between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.\n\nNixon was certified the winner by the state governor after prevailing by 140 votes that year, but a recount was underway the day electors met to cast votes. Electors for both candidates signed certificates and delivered them to Congress.\n\n""And a court in Hawaii said that\'s the right way to do it,"" continued Dershowitz, who was recently among a team of lawyers sanctioned for filing a meritless lawsuit on behalf of Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake that sought to force counties to hand count ballots.\n\nWilenchik said Dershowitz\'s comments support the move as legitimate, and he called the prosecution in Michigan ""bogus and political.""\n\n“What these people put on their certificates here in Arizona was just that we believe we are the duly elected electors. They didn’t say they were certified. They weren’t certified,"" Wilenchik continued. ""That is what I was pointing out in the email. Certified means the governor and secretary of state were signing off on it.”\n\nWilenchik said he did not mislead any of the people who signed the documents or tell them the documents would only be submitted if courts overturned Arizona’s election.\n\nExpert says state charges more likely than federal\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political sciences in the School of Global Politics and the Sandra Day O\'Connor College of Law at ASU, said state charges are more likely than federal charges for the Arizona fake electors.\n\n“It may be that the federal government has concluded this is best left to the state attorneys general to prosecute,” she said.\n\nLindquist clerked for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia and practiced law at Latham and Watkins in Washington, D.C.\n\nEven setting aside the possibility of charging the electors with a criminal conspiracy, Arizona has a statute that criminalizes creating a public record ""knowing that it has been falsely made,"" that could apply to the document the electors sent to Congress, she said.\n\nIt doesn\'t help the Arizona fake electors that two states, Pennsylvania and New Mexico, offered conditional language in their documents stating they would only be valid if those state elections were overturned, while Arizona and the other states did not.\n\nThe federal indictment states that Trump’s allies wanted to prevent the other fake electors from using similar conditional language, which she said was improper on their part.\n\n“What a cynical, fraudulent thing to do to these dupes in the state legislatures,” she said. “It’s not that these people shouldn’t have known better. I think they should have. There’s no doubt they were manipulated by the conspirators.”\n\nIt’s possible the Justice Department intentionally let the electors off the hook so that it might secure testimony from those people to help prosecute Trump or the co-conspirators, she said.\n\nThe states where fake electors submitted documents were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe fake electors in Arizona were: Tyler Bowyer, an executive with Turning Point USA and a committeeman for the Republican National Committee; Nancy Cottle, who chaired the Arizona Trump electors; lawmaker Jake Hoffman; state senator Anthony Kern; Jim Lamon, a failed U.S. Senate candidate; Robert Montgomery of the Cochise County Republican Committee; Samuel Moorhead of the Gila County Republican Party; Loraine Pellegrino, the secretary of the Arizona Trump electors; Greg Safsten, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; Kelli Ward, the state GOP chair at the time; and Michael Ward, her husband and a GOP activist.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/judges-ruling-arizona-fake-electors-131400886.html', 'Headline': ""After a judge's ruling, Arizona fake electors could be one step ... - Yahoo"", 'Snippet': 'A photo posted on Twitter by the Republican Party of Arizona showed the electors sitting in prayer before casting their votes for Donald Trump on Dec. 14, 2020.', 'Full_text': ""They were part of a scheme involving other Republicans in other states that tried to overturn the results of a democratically decided presidential election.\n\nThere should be a price to pay for that.\n\nIt should involve prison.\n\nAt the very least they should be publicly exposed and vilified and, thanks to U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa, there’s a slightly better chance that will happen.\n\nJudge Humetewa said the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection could subpoena the records of Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward.\n\nWard and her would-be band of bungling election thieves put together a phony electoral slate and sent it sent to Washington, D.C., attempting to cast Arizona’s ballots for Donald Trump instead of rightful winner Joe Biden.\n\nWhen do we start the Hillary chant?\n\nThey’ve since tried to argue that the phony electors were only meant to be considered the real thing “in the event that the legal challenges to the Arizona results succeeded.”\n\nExcept that nothing in the document sent by certified mail to the U.S. Senate and National Archives spoke of legal challenges. Instead, the document falsely asserted that the 11 Arizona shills were the “duly elected and qualified” presidential electors, with no conditional language.\n\nJust a backup: Ward asserts fake electors were only meant as a fail-safe\n\nLock.\n\nThem.\n\nUp.\n\nYou may recall how, in July, The New York Times reported on emails that displayed what the article describes as the “often slapdash efforts of advisers” to then President Trump used to try to subvert the election. The names of reactionary Republican notables like Arizona’s Kelli Ward and attorney Jack Wilenchik show up in the article.\n\nThe report quotes an email from Wilenchik to Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn that reads, “We (Arizona Republicans) would just be sending in ‘fake’ electoral votes to Pence so that ‘someone’ in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the ‘fake’ votes should be counted.”\n\nSubstituting 'alternative' for 'fake'\n\nImagine that.\n\nBlatantly admitting that the electors were “fake.”\n\nKind of damning, don’t you think?\n\nPerhaps that is why the report noted that Wilenchik sent a follow-up email saying, “‘alternative’ votes is probably a better term than ‘fake’ votes,” followed by a smiley face emoji.\n\nIt’s uncertain what Ward’s phone records will reveal.\n\nThe fact that Ward and her cohorts have tried so hard to keep them out of public view doesn’t bode well … for them. Ward is appealing the judges decision to the 9th Circuit, of course. Delay. Delay. Delay.\n\nNo matter how long it takes to get to the bottome of this we know for sure is that the phony electors and their crackpot scheme put our electoral process – our country – in danger.\n\nAn attempted breach of that process should have the same consequences that are facing the insurrectionists who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nReal consequences.\n\nJail.\n\nReach Montini at

added, quote, protecting the vote by mail system used by a majority of Arizonans and getting dark money out of our election is his too important to fall victim to Washington disfunction.\n\nKelly\'s

of COVID-19.\n\nThey also added 21 new COVID-related fatalities.\n\nOne new COVID note.\n\nNew research from the C.D.C.\n\nshows the best protection against COVID is a vax nice not a previous infection, based on 1 million vaccinated and unvaccinated people.\n\nStudy shows that vaccination and prior infection each help protect against new infections vaccinations protect against hospitalizations, significantly more than natural immunity alone.\n\nThe study was conducted through November prior to the introduction and spread of the omicron variant.\n\nAfter year\'s election, two separate slates of fake presidential electors tried to reverse Arizona\'s presidential election by sending fake election certificates to the national archives to learn more about why anyone would come up with such an idea and whether or not these actions are legal.\n\nWe spoke to Paul Charlton the former U.S. attorney for Arizona and the partner in the denton\'s law firm.\n\nGood to see you, Paul, thanks for joining news studio and good to have you on set as opposed to zoom.\n\nGood it see everyone here as opposed to zoom and we continue to try to Transition back to the set.\n\nWe are talking about these fake electors.\n\nAnd they are fake electors they are not the really lectors.\n\nFirst of all, as far as the presidential election is concerned, who are electors and how are they chosen?\n\nWhat kind of authority do they have?\n\n>> In this state, Ted, electors are chosen by the party to whom the candidate belongs.\n\nSo then president trump had a slate of electors chosen by the Republican party who would represent the Republican party in the electoral college the Democrats had their own set of electors who would and did vote for now president beaten in the electoral college, they are chosen by the parties to whom the candidate belongs.\n\n>> And once the election is over, candidate ""A"" let\'s call him, I don\'t know, bides en, his cast of the electors that group is the official elector for Arizona and candidate ""B"" trump\'s group they have -- they are done, they go home.\n\n>> Correct, in this state it\'s a winner take all electoral college.\n\nSo the popular vote, goies to the Court, our opinion general the governor, went to now president Biden.\n\nSo all 11 lex to recall votes went to president bite glen and the governor signs a certify ascertain little and everything is done, deal, signed and exempt when you have a group of folks, now, first of all, these group of folks who are pro trump, were these the same group that was the official Republican slate or is this a different crowd?\n\n>> There are two different entities if you will that, purported to be the dually elected electors from our state and who were, in fact not those dually elected election tours one group called themselves sovereign citizens submitting a document that had the official state seal on it to the national archives contends that go they should be voting for or should our state should vote for president trump.\n\nAnother group, led by Kelly ward, the head of the Republican party in this state, also contended that they were the dually elected electors and instead of placing those votes for now president bind, they said and filed this document officially.\n\nSaying that they instead were voting for then president trump.\n\n>> So you had two different groups, you could possibly have had three different groupings on president trump\'s side as a slate of -- who gets to choose which one is the real one?\n\n>> So the president was elected, so says the governor of the state, who signed off on the certificate, says the attorney general who reviewed it, sent to the national archives that look today make sure the documents that they received were the official documents from the secretary of state.\n\nThese other, if you will, people who contended that they were electors may have crossed the line by Smith document that wasn\'t authentic.\n\n>> I was going ask about that, one of these groups submitted a document with the official seal of Arizona on it.\n\nSent it to the national archives I guess even to the sent at or the white house one to the archives the other I don\'t know where it is, but that sounds ill throwing me.\n\n>> And I think a prosecutor reviewing the facts here, Ted, would have good cause to contact an investigation and determine whether or not those people who claimed to have been the lawful lectors but were not, crossed a line.\n\nAnd, in fact, committed a crime by submit a false document to an official entity such as the national archives.\n\n>> Back up a bit here.\n\nWhy would these groups think theft authority?\n\nWhere did this idea come from?\n\n>> If we were to ask them, Ted, I suspect it\'s a fair assumption that they would argue that they believe in good faith that the result of the last election was one of fraud and that\'s because their president told them so.\n\nIt\'s because the lawyers from the president\'s office told them so.\n\nPresident trump said so and his lawyers said so they believed they were acting in faith what a prosecutor has do is look in to the mind of these individuals to see if they knew these documents were fraudulent.\n\nYou have to look at other evidence, like we discussed the fact that our governor believed that Biden had won the election.\n\nThe fact that our Republican attorney general believed that Biden had won the race for president, and that every court that has looked at this, Ted, has determined that president Biden is our president.\n\n>> In fact.\n\nAnd I would think that if you were the group that thought your candidate lost the election because it was quote, unquote, rigged I mute have a set of electors that you have gathered in some way, shape, our form but you hold on and wait and see what the courts say, what the governor says, what a whole slew of people.\n\nAs opposed to just send this is stuff off and saying, that\'s it, we are now -- Donald trump has won the say of Arizona.\n\nIt doesn\'t make any sense to me.\n\n>> One attorney general, Ted, who is in a similar situation from a state like ours, Michigan, has reviewed the facts of these individuals who submitted a document to the national archive contending to be votes for then president trump, and she believes that it is, in fact, a fraud, that it\'s a violation of state law and she contends because there was coordination among a number of states, she thinks, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, that it\'s the kind of fraud so broad in scope, that the federal government, the U.S. attorney general, ought to investigate and she has referred this matter formally for investigation by the attorney general of the United States.\n\n>> Interesting.\n\nHas this kind of thing been thought of before?\n\n>> I don\'t know that we have ever seen this sort of broad scope of individuals who would pretend to be electors when they, in fact, are not.\n\nWe have electors who have appeared at the electoral college and voted for a candidate to whom they were not sent to vote.\n\nThose small issues have occurred.\n\nBut one with this breadth and depth and number has never occurred in our nation before.\n\n>> It sounds lying I get together with a bunch of friend and I say I think I won the State of Arizona and send something off to the national archives.\n\nWhere do you think -- >> That\'s part of the problem, we all have a First Amendment right to espouse or believes right or Wrong it\'s one thing to that you believe the election was a result of fraud.\n\nIt\'s another to submit what purports to be an official document contending that the true winner of our electoral votes is then president trump.\n\nThat\'s where this aspect, these facts, are going to and should involve some scrutiny by prosecutors whether or not, Ted, that results at the end of the day in charges, we can\'t say.\n\n>> Is this kind of saying could it be interesting, could it be relevant as far as January sixth inquiry.\n\n>> I think we know that investigators from the January 6th committee have been out to Arizona already and interviewed some of our public officials.\n\nSo that part of the equation, what will happen in congress, what will be the result of their investigation, I think we can predict that this will be a part of that.\n\nWhat happens, though, behind the closed doors of Prosecutors and law enforcement officials we don\'t have that transparency in to their decision making process to know other than I think we can say with confidence they are probably considering it.\n\nWe\'ll have to see whether or not it\'s the kind of issue that they will take up and move forward with.\n\n>> I gotta tell you it sounds like a junior high school civics class gone wrong.\n\nIt just is hard to explain and to understand, but thank you so much, Paul, we do appreciate you.\n\nGood to sea.\n\n>> You good to

candace industry, we learn more from online distance ends indication vice pro vest at the U of A. Craig Wilson welcome to ""Arizona Horizon.""\n\nGood to have you here as we talk about the three noncredit cannabis certificate programs at the University of Arizona what, is this all about?\n\nTell us more this.\n\n>> Yeah, so, again, it\'s three different areas one is the business of cannabis, another one is for healthcare and the third one is for law and policy.\n\n>> Let\'s start with business now.\n\nWhat will they be thought.\n\nWhat do they need to know in terms of the business of cannabis?\n\n>> So let\'s see.\n\nThe first one covers the actual history of the candace industry.\n\nThe second course within the business side, covers from sea to scale -- excuse me from, sea to sale.\n\nAnd the third one is scaling operation.\n\nYou know, so if you already have an operation and a defense pence are you, how do you scale it.\n\nIt\'s like any other business, you know, where you are looking to make it viable and maybe expand it.\n\nThis covers it, but with a cannabis focus.\n\n>> And the cannabis focus I would imagine comes in to sharp focus when you talk about cannabis and the law.\n\nWhich is another one of these programs, tell us more about that.\n\n>> Yeah, so for the long side let me take a quick look at the law side it covers law and policy from a historic perspective and regional analysis as well as he merging sectors, so it looks at policy and looked at emerging sectors for regulation and things that have nature and that is geared for lawyers, legal professionals.\n\nLaw enforcement and those interested in compliance.\n\n>> That sound like it could be change at a moment\'s notice, too, that\'s how that works in that industry.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\nI would agree.\n\nI imagine that will become a very sought after area of study.\n\n>> The aspects of cannabis, health care and medicine what, will be talk in that particular course line?\n\n>> They\'ll cost essentials of cannabis medicine and integrated clinical practice of cannabis medicine.\n\nGeared to those in allied health, health care professional and things that have sort.\n\n>> Okay.\n\nWho are the teachers, who are the instructors for these certificate programs?\n\n>> That\'s a good question.\n\nThe teachers are board certified physician, psychiatrist, particularly in the healthcare industry, a clinical specialist, pharmacologist and the like.\n\nAnd with respect to the law and policy, these are attorneys and other legal professionals who are in the cannabis industry and with respect to business, those are covered by topics effectives in the field to include entrepreneurs already in the business and, again, lawyers and what have you who cover it from a business standpoint.\n\n>> Who do you see as likely students for these certification programs?\n\n[Speaking at the same time] >> Yeah, that\'s interesting.\n\nI think, again, for the law and policy, it kind of is self select.\n\nFor the healthcare side it\'s also seem to self select.\n\nBut you -- I would imagine the business one is the most open.\n\nHowever, a person can, in fact, enroll in the other one, you probably want to have some sort of baseline foundational knowledge.\n\nSo everybody for instance, law and policy we see the folks to be law enforcement, for lawyers, or folks who are in to compliance.\n\n>> Are there any -- it would seem like there is not a heck of a lot of precedent for team these kind of courses and classes, you mentioned history to a certain extent that\'s there.\n\nIn terms of legal cannabis that\'s a whole -- that\'s a brand-new baby here.\n\nAre there other programs around the country, best practices you can look at or is this thing hitting the ground and you\'ll just see what happens?\n\n>> Well, yeah, there are other programs throughout the country.\n\nAnd other states, particularly where it\'s been legalized for recreational use.\n\nAnd as well as states that are considering it or states that are using it for medicinal purposes.\n\nIt\'s a nationwide in terms of scope.\n\nAnd you know, here in Arizona, our main concern -- our main point, say, focus is to make sure that as folks are contemplating entering that space that, we are doing what we can to help them with professional icing the practice and also to provide professional development for those who might already be in the industry.\n\nBut are seeking to figure out ways to provide professional deposit to this what they are doing.\n\n>> Very good.\n\nAll right, registration when and classes start when?\n\n>> Sure, registration is open now.\n\nClasses start in March.\n\nI encourage if you are interesting to go to CE.Arizona.EDU for more information.\n\n>> And real quickly the cost just under $3,000 percent S that\'s a ballpark

in to entertainment but what I did was I did Youtube videos satire icing the stayed-run media.\n\nI was very mesmerized by Jon Stewart.\n\nI just put it on the internet.\n\nI didn\'t even think twice this would go anywhere.\n\nAnd then it exploded and suddenly I am host paying apolitical satire show and it\'s the biggest show in the middle east and it was fun and scary and interesting and it was stressful.\n\nAnd all of the above.\n\nAnd for three years I did the show, it was very successful, but the government didn\'t like me that much.\n\nThey hated me the military hated me.\n\nAnd I ended up having to leaved Egypt and coming to the United States and continuing my career as a stand-up comic.\n\n>> You are fascinated by Jon Stewart, you became the Jon Stewart of the middle east.\n\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n[ Laughter ] >> And now when you say you had to leave Egypt, did you have to leave Egypt or else?\n\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah, there was actual lay verdict against me.\n\nIt was political in nature I had to pay 100 million pounds as a fine for the network that actually canceled me the lawyer said, listen this is the way they\'ll get you without appearing in front of the rest of the world that they are like putting you for freedom of expression and it\'s like you need to leave right now.\n\nSo the verdict was at 12:00 noon and my flight as at 5:00.\n\n>> If that had not happened do you think you would have stayed in Egypt?\n\n>> I don\'t might have stayed but I don\'t think my conditions would be very optimal.\n\n>> Eventually this would happen one way or another?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\nAnd I think like -- I mean, at the time I was very nervous, I didn\'t know what to do.\n\nI didn\'t know where -- what I would even do in the United States.\n\nBut it\'s just like you had to -- I had to re-wire my brain to do come did I in a different language, English is my second language.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> Piping yourself doing stand-up comedy in a foreign language to a foreign audience, in a totally like foreign, like setting.\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> Because we didn\'t-- like stand-up comedy is not really an established Art in Egypt in, the Arab world in general.\n\nI had to teach myself a new form of Art.\n\n>> That\'s really interesting.\n\n-- did you find that what folks in the middle east laughed at maybe folks in the U.S. either Don lavas much at or don\'t quite get and vice versa?\n\n>> No.\n\nEvery language has a secondary language which is comedy.\n\nBecause therefore references, history, punchlines even the used words is different.\n\nWhat can work in a language is not necessarily translated in a different language, you have to get -- use, for example, it\'s a stupid example, but people all over around the world love ""friends.""\n\n>> The show.\n\n>> Slap stick, sure.\n\nBut not many of them can get ""Frazier.""\n\nWhich is the -- >> Why?\n\n>> Because it\'s kind of like a more of a sophisticated Condie.\n\nMany people don\'t get ""seinfeld"" because it\'s a show about nothing and it\'s different.\n\n>> Is it the physical stuff?\n\n>> No, nuances for each language very -- even when you speak Arabic.\n\nSomebody in Iraq who speaks Arabic like Egypt the comedy does not translate sometimes.\n\nThey don\'t understand what you mean, you know?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> So it\'s -- >> That\'s really fascinating.\n\nAnd, again, there topics that an American audience will laugh at and not so much middle east and the middle east finds hilarious and the American audience stairs?\n\n>> Given if everybody understands each other\'s language you find a lot of people would love.\n\nSo, for example, I didn\'t understand Jon Stewart in the beginning you was fascinated by him but I didn\'t understand what he was talking about, what are Democrats, what are Republicans, what is Fox news I saw people laughing but I didn\'t understand why it was funny.\n\nToyed understand the references and the background of these jokes to understand the joke.\n\nSo it\'s like a joke not just a punchline it\'s much deeper than that.\n\nIt\'s a lot of nuances, references, history, background, that you have to educate yourself about that.\n\n>> There is a fraternity of stand-up Comedians and men and women who are in this business, they really stick together.\n\nThey help each other.\n\nSometimes compete against each other.\n\n>> They hate each other.\n\n>> They hate each other.\n\nDid you find, though, a helping audience, a helping crowd there when you got in to the business here in the U.S. >> I had very positive experiences when I started in the U.S., when I started crafting my show I had a residency in Joe\'s pub in New York, which is a place where artists go and they try out the material.\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> Some nights were not very good.\n\n>> Sure.\n\n>> And some nights were great.\n\nBut it is -- it\'s the culture here in the United States, where people can go to a place knowing that this is not really the final product.\n\nAnd you can see that a lot on Broadway.\n\n>> Off Broadway.\n\n>> Go to not just off Broadway even when the show is getting ready.\n\nThey go to see the rehearsal and dress rehearsal.\n\nIt\'s kind of like I love the fact that a lot of -- there is kind of like a support for performance Art.\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> And this is why I am happy to be in ASU because this is something that you don\'t see in the middle east.\n\nYou know, like a theater, that big, that amazing in the middle of a university campus, my fair lady, Hamilton all player on a university campus, this is amazing.\n\nSo I real like the fact that there is a lot of support for people here that want to see Art, people want to experience Art, people wants to laugh.\n\nPeople want to cry and laugh with you, that\'s why I love being

you.\n\n>> Again no thoughts of ever going back to thoracic surgery or anything?\n\n>> No, no, I don\'t miss the night shifts.\n\nNo.\n\nI don\'t miss the long -- I don\'t miss any of it.\n\n>> Not at all?\n\n>> I love going out and performing and I know that like so far the ticket sales and Gammage is going very well and I hope the people watching will come to the show.\n\n>> Right.\n\n>> I hope

Rand Paul and Roger Marshall came in a hearing on the federal response to the Omicron variant of Covid-19 as the Biden administration faces growing scrutiny alongside record hospitalizations, testing challenges and messaging frustration – issues the GOP has seized on.\n\nEarly in the hearing, after Paul sought to cast Fauci as a “dangerous” government official, the White House chief medical adviser and top infectious disease expert said such rhetoric “kindles the crazies” and has led to threats against his family.\n\n“What happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue is that all of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there and I have life – threats upon my life – harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me,” Fauci said before suggesting the Kentucky Republican was attacking him as a way of raising money.\n\n“So I asked myself, ‘Why would Senator want to do this?’ So, go to Rand Paul website. And you see, ‘Fire Dr. Fauci’ with a little box that says, ‘contribute here,’ you can do $5, $10, $20, $100,” he said. “So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.”\n\nFauci brought a similarly pointed tone to his exchange with Marshall after the Kansas Republican falsely accused him of withholding financial disclosure forms.\n\n“You’re so misinformed, it’s extraordinary,” a visibly frustrated Fauci told Marshall, calling his financial information “public knowledge” for nearly four decades. After the back-and-forth, Fauci could be heard saying, “What a moron. Jesus Christ.”\n\nSpeaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360” Tuesday evening, Fauci said public health officials “should be having to respond to tough questions.”\n\n“And yet, the only thing that came out of Sen. Rand Paul and, to some extent, Sen. Roger Marshall, were ad hominems, which does nothing but distract from what we really need to be doing,” he said.\n\nIn response to the hearing, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN in a statement Tuesday that Republicans on the panel “clearly weren’t trying to stop the spread” of misinformation.\n\n“At a time when America is seeing rising COVID cases, it’s disappointing and frankly unacceptable that Republican Senators chose to spend a hearing with the country’s leading public health experts spreading conspiracy theories and lies about Dr. Fauci, rather than how we protect people from COVID-19,” spokesman Ian Sams said.\n\n“The Biden Administration will continue to focus on getting more Americans vaccinated and boosted and helping Americans get access to the tools to keep themselves and others safe. We would encourage these Republicans to join us.”\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s about three times last winter’s peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to Johns Hopkins.\n\n“Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody,” Fauci told J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, on Tuesday.\n\n“Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/06/17/fauci-rand-paul-covid-boosters-children-mxp-sot-vpx.hln', 'Headline': '‘Are you gonna let me answer a question?’: Fauci and Paul face off in ...', 'Snippet': 'During a Senate committee hearing on the ongoing federal response to the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci faced questions from Sen.

""So you\'re not only distorting it, you are completely turning it around, as you usually do.""\n\nPaul said in a statement after the hearing, ""Anyone who dares to question Fauci’s smear campaign against other scientists is accused by Fauci of fomenting violence.""\n\n""As someone who actually was the target of semiautomatic gunfire by a Bernie Sanders supporter, I never once accused Senator Sanders of being responsible for the attack and I resent Fauci avoiding the question by ginning up the idea that his opponents are the cause of threats,"" Paul added.\n\nPaul was referring to a 2017 shooting when Rep.

Paul was the first senator known to have contracted the coronavirus when he tested positive in March 2020.\n\nIn July, Paul implied that Fauci had previously lied to Congress and was aware of what the lab in Wuhan, China, was doing with grant money that came from the NIH.\n\nTuesday\'s hearing also sparked a tense exchange between Fauci and Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., about Fauci\'s financial disclosures and investments.\n\nAfter the back-and-forth, Fauci was heard on a hot mic saying: ""What a moron.

But a Gateway Pundit story shared on Facebook in June 2021 declared, “SMOKING GUN: FAUCI LIED, MILLIONS DIED — Fauci Was Informed of Hydroxychloroquine Success in Early 2020 But Lied to Public Instead Despite the Science.”\n\nThe story was based on two emails that were sent to Fauci in February 2020. In one email, two doctors expressed the possibility that the drug could be effective against COVID-19. Fauci forwarded the email to an NIH deputy director who works in microbiology and infectious diseases and wrote: “Please take a look and respond to them. Thanks.”\n\nIn the other email, a pharmacologist made reference to “data from 2005 showing inhibition of SARS infection,” which is a different disease caused by a different coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) from the one that leads to COVID-19. We previously wrote about a 2005 study that found the drug prevented the spread of that SARS virus in cell culture — which is not the same as working in humans.\n\nThose emails are not evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, or that Fauci kept this from the public. In fact, randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The drug was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nA viral social media post falsely claimed that Fauci was “pushing” remdesivir because he “invented” it with Bill Gates and they would profit from its use.\n\nFauci does not hold a patent for remdesivir, and a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told USA Today that the foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of the drug.\n\nSee, “Fauci Didn’t Invent, Won’t Profit from Remdesivir,” May 21, 2020\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nIt is still uncertain how SARS-CoV-2 originated, but many scientists suspect the virus “spilled over” into humans from an animal. There is no evidence the virus was created in a lab, let alone as part of any U.S.-funded research.\n\nA June 2021 Facebook post claimed that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” because of an email he received from Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. In that Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” He mentioned others, too, found “the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\n\nBut Andersen said in his email that more analysis was necessary and “opinions could still change,” which is what later happened.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists that said they determined that the coronavirus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The authors added that they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.”\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nFormer White House trade adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that Fauci “killed a lot of people” by funding some bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is in Wuhan, China, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified.\n\nNIAID did provide a multimillion-dollar grant to fund some of the lab’s research, but the NIH has explained that those experiments could not have led to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because the viruses that were being studied were very different.\n\n“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” then-NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20, 2021, statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”\n\nSee, “Navarro Falsely Links Fauci to Pandemic Origin,” May 19, 2022\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul accused Fauci of lying when Fauci said in a May 2021 Senate hearing that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” But there’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in a July 20, 2021, hearing, about funding gain-of-function research — which the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to “increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.”\n\nFauci has said that the research that was funded “was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,” and the NIH has said the same. The issue is that scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul has posited that Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” if the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research. But there is no proof of a lab leak, and there is evidence that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant could not have caused the pandemic.\n\nSee, “The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,” May 21, 2021, and “Fauci and Paul, Round 2,” July 22, 2021\n\nIn December 2014, the NIH posted a photo of Fauci and former President Barack Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The photo showed Obama speaking about Ebola research with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, and Fauci was shown standing next to Sylvia Burwell, who was the health and human services secretary at the time.\n\nBut the years-old photo was circulated in 2020 along with the false claim that the image showed “Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015,” suggesting a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee, “Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab,'”July 17, 2020\n\nOther Claims\n\nA series of reports in 2021 from a group that opposes federal funding for research relying on animal testing prompted dozens of readers to ask us if Fauci had a history of cruelty to animals, specifically beagles.\n\nThe NIAID admitted to FactCheck.org in a statement that Fauci was involved in the process of awarding funding for a number of research projects that used beagles as test subjects. But the agency denied that it funded one particular project in Tunisia that went viral on social media because of images from a published study that showed sedated beagles with their heads stuck in mesh cages filled with diseased sand flies.\n\nSee, “Answering Questions About #BeagleGate,” Nov. 2, 2021\n\nFauci is among the many federal employees who are required to submit an annual public financial disclosure report to their employing agency or department. His reports — which list his assets, income, employment agreements and other financial information — are available upon request from the NIH’s FOIA office.\n\nBut in a January congressional hearing, Republican Sen. Roger Marshall asked Fauci if he would be willing to publicly release “a financial disclosure form,” suggesting that Fauci’s reports are not available to the public and are being hidden by “the big tech giants.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nationalreview.com/news/fauci-knew-nih-funded-wuhans-gain-of-function-research-as-pandemic-began-email-reveals/', 'Headline': ""Anthony Fauci Knew NIH Funded Wuhan's Gain-of-Function Research as ..."", 'Snippet': 'Months later, a top NIH official admitted in an October 2021 letter that the NIH did fund gain-of-function research on coronaviruses, despite Fauci’s argument to the contrary.', 'Full_text': ''}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.heritage.org/public-health/commentary/how-fauci-and-nih-leaders-worked-discredit-covid-19-lab-leak-theory', 'Headline': 'How Fauci and NIH Leaders Worked to Discredit COVID-19 Lab Leak Theory', 'Snippet': 'Collins, the NIH director, echoed these sentiments, saying that without a case for COVID-19’s natural origins, ”the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate, doing great potential harm to ...', 'Full_text': 'House of Representatives investigators just issued an interim report on Tuesday detailing a sophisticated effort by leaders at the National Institutes of Health and a select group of researchers—including those who had received substantial NIH grant funding—to disprove the hypothesis that COVID-19 originated in a Chinese research laboratory and push the narrative that it instead emerged from nature.\n\nRepublican staff of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic chaired by Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, have collected more than 8,000 documents, including emails and other communications, plus nearly 25 hours of witness testimony.\n\nTheir report details the January through March 2020 activities of Dr. Anthony Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins in encouraging an international team of prominent scientists to attempt to debunk the notion that the pandemic could have originated in a lab.\n\nThe Means\n\nFollowing a Feb. 1, 2020, conference call, Fauci and Collins “prompted” the scientists to act. According to the report:\n\nThrough its investigation, the select subcommittee has learned that Dr. Fauci and NIH exerted more influence over the conference call than previously disclosed. Further, by the end of the Feb. 1 conference call, Dr. Fauci had suggested the drafting of a paper regarding the potential of a lab leak to Dr. [Kristian] Andersen twice. This suggestion was what ‘prompted’ Dr. Andersen to draft ‘Proximal Origin.’\n\n“Proximal Origin” refers to “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2,” the paper that ultimately was published in a scientific journal.\n\nThe end of this exercise was not a disinterested scientific effort, but rather an elaborate scheme to create a preferred political narrative that would dominate public discussion of the novel coronavirus. The means was publication in a high-powered, peer-reviewed professional journal that would discredit the “lab leak” theory.\n\nEncouraged by Collins and Fauci, the authors submitted their initial draft to Nature, but the journal turned it down because the editors wanted a stronger dismissal of the lab leak theory. As Andersen testified to the subcommittee, “They thought that we came down too strongly on the side that the virus had been of possible lab origin.”\n\nSo, the authors revised their paper, adding language that the lab origin was implausible, and successfully submitted it to Nature Medicine, part of the Nature portfolio of journals. The finished product—titled “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2”—was published in Nature Medicine on March 17, 2020.\n\nThe Nature Medicine article, according to the subcommittee report, “is one of the single most impactful and influential scientific papers in history, and it expressed conclusions that were not based on sound science nor in fact, but instead on assumptions.”\n\nData Problem\n\nIn arguing for a natural or zoonotic (transferred from animals to humans) origin of the pandemic, the fact that SARS-CoV-2 had certain genetic features not found in previous coronaviruses was a problem, but an even greater difficulty was the absence of hard data. On Jan. 3, 2020, Communist Chinese authorities shut down the sharing of any COVID-19 data or information without government approval.\n\nAs noted in a Senate staff report sponsored by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.:\n\nScientists have not yet succeeded at tracing the origin because they have been denied access to the data that would facilitate a retrospective study of its genomic epidemiology. The epidemiological data released by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) appears to have been curated to create an informational maze that leads to perpetual puzzlement.\n\nTherefore, none of the scientists engaged by Fauci or Collins in February 2020 had, or could have had, access to any hard Chinese data on the novel coronavirus—especially information of an intermediate animal host—that could have proven, or at least strongly supported, the Chinese-endorsed narrative of the zoonotic or natural origin of the pandemic.\n\nSeveral potential candidates for the intermediate animal host, including pangolins and raccoon dogs, have been floated; but to this day, no such host has been identified.\n\nNumerous emails among the multiple authors during the Nature Medicine article’s drafting in February 2020 are especially revealing. Dr. Robert Garry of Tulane University, for example, initially expressed the view that the virus could have been genetically manipulated in a lab. Based on a previous select subcommittee report, he was not alone among this group of virologists in his initial impressions.\n\nAccording to this week’s subcommittee report, Andersen, of Scripps Research Institute, who completed the initial draft, admitted in an email on Feb. 8, 2020:\n\nOur main work over the last couple of weeks has been focused on trying to disprove any type of lab theory, but we are at a crossroad where the scientific evidence isn’t conclusive enough to say that we have high confidence in any of the three main theories considered.\n\nIn a Feb. 11 email, Dr. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University said the paper provided a “plausible argument against genetic engineering,” but it did not close the door on an “inadvertent release” of the virus from the Wuhan lab. It stated:\n\nGiven the scale of the bat Cov [a wide range of bat-borne coronaviruses] research pursued there and the site of its emergence of the first human cases, we have a nightmare of circumstantial evidence to assess.\n\nThen again, on Feb. 20, Andersen—seemingly struggling with the task of refuting a lab origin conclusively—admitted in an email, “We all really, really wish we could do that (that’s how this got started), but unfortunately, it’s just not possible given the data.”\n\nSo, in the absence of scientific data, Andersen and his team proposed a theoretical construct of how SARS-CoV-2 emerged in nature.\n\nMotives\n\nFuture congressional inquiries into this controversy should, of course, focus on the motivation behind this extraordinary effort to disprove the lab leak theory.\n\nBased on the email exchanges among the key participants, this little platoon seemed inordinately obsessed with maintaining good relations with Communist China. In a Feb. 2 email, Dr. Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh wrote:\n\nGiven the s— show that would happen if anyone serious accused the Chinese of even accidental release, my feeling is we should say that given there is no evidence of a specifically engineered virus, we cannot possibly distinguish between natural evolution and escape, so we are content with ascribing it to natural process.\n\nScientists must keep their priorities in order, emphasized Dr. Ron Fouchier, a Dutch virologist: “Further debate about such accusations [of a lab leak] would unnecessarily distract top researchers from their active duties and do unnecessary harm to science in general and science in China in particular.”\n\nCollins, the NIH director, echoed these sentiments, saying that without a case for COVID-19’s natural origins, ”the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate, doing great potential harm to science and international harmony.”\n\nIn short, the email traffic follows the politics.\n\nConcerning Fauci, the subcommittee report simply recounts that he knew at the time, or should have known, that his agency had funded EcoHealth Alliance, a firm engaged in “dangerous experiments” with the Wuhan Institute of Virology; that these coronavirus research activities were conducted with “very little oversight”; that EcoHealth Alliance was not in compliance with the federal government’s grant requirements and failed to report on its work in a timely fashion; and that the Wuhan Institute’s biosafety levels were “substandard”—a fact recently confirmed by the director of national intelligence. Congressional investigators will surely need to probe Fauci’s memory of these matters.\n\nThough the hypothesis of a lab leak as the origin of a pandemic that has killed more than 1.1 million Americans is no longer dismissed today as a “conspiracy theory,” the damage to democratic discourse has been done.\n\nThe Nature Medicine article became the seminal scientific paper that drove the dominant narrative of COVID-19’s natural origins for the past three and half years. It also provided the strongest justification to marginalize alternative scientific opinion.\n\nThat corrosive impact on public discourse was itself a scandal. As New York Times columnist Bret Stephens observed: “The reasons for this—rank partisanship and credulous reporting—and the methods by which it was enforced—censorship and vilification—are reminders that sometimes the most destructive enemies of science can be those who claim to speak in its name.”\n\nEditor’s note: This article was updated on March 25, 2024, to correct the excerpt from Dr. Kristian Andersen’s email of Feb. 8, 2020.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/extremely-disconcerting-nih-didnt-track-us-funds-going-to-chinese-virus-research-watchdog-finds-004808475.html', 'Headline': ""NIH didn't track U.S. funds going to Chinese virus research ... - Yahoo"", 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, a new government ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, according to a new government report that is sure to raise new questions about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe report is evidence of “major failures in past NIH oversight of high-risk research on enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” Rutgers molecular biologist Richard Ebright told Yahoo News in an email.\n\nIssued by the inspector general of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the new report says nothing about the origins of the coronavirus. For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners. But he has also conceded that much about how the virus came to be remains unknown.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/politics/biden-admin-suspends-wuhan-lab-funding/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden administration suspends funding for Wuhan lab', 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that ...', 'Full_text': 'The Biden administration has suspended funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology following a monthslong review that determined that the Chinese research institute “is not compliant with federal regulations and is not presently responsible,” according to a memo from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHHS, which conducted the review, also proposed barring the Wuhan Institute from doing business with the federal government going forward, according to the memo, which is dated to Monday and was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe lab has not received any federal funding from the US National Institutes of Health since July 2020, according to an HHS spokesperson.\n\nThe determination came after the research institute failed to provide the National Institutes of Health with requested documents amid reported safety concerns at the lab.\n\n“This action aims to ensure that WIV does not receive another dollar of federal funding,” an HHS spokesperson said in a statement. “The move was undertaken due to WIV’s failure to provide documentation on WIV’s research requested by NIH related to concerns that WIV violated NIH’s biosafety protocols.”\n\nIn Monday’s memorandum, HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for acquisition concludes that the Wuhan Institute’s “disregard of the NIH’s requests” and the NIH’s conclusion that the institute’s research likely violated biosafety protocols present a risk that the institute “not only previously violated, but is currently violating, and will continue to violate, protocols of the NIH on biosafety.”\n\n“Therefore, I have determined that the immediate suspension of WIV is necessary to mitigate any potential public health risk,” the official, whose name is redacted, writes in the memo.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology is at the center of a theory that Covid-19 escaped from the lab in late 2019, triggering the global pandemic and nearly 7 million recorded deaths.

Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic.

The agency then asked for lab notebooks and other files pertaining to the experiments, and EcoHealth reported that it would relay the request to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the new NIH letters, the Wuhan institute never delivered.\n\n“NIH has requested on two occasions that [EcoHealth] provide NIH the laboratory notebooks and original electronic files from the research conducted at [the Wuhan Institute of Virology]. To date, [the institute] has not provided these records,” Lauer told Comer. NIH verified to the Bulletin that the letters were authentic.\n\nA letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide the requested records, and [EcoHealth’s] failure to include the required terms in [the] subaward agreement represent material failures to comply with the terms of award,” the letter said.\n\nBetween June 2017 and May 2019, scientists working on EcoHealth’s grant tested genetically engineered coronaviruses with the backbone of one virus and the spike proteins—which bind to host cells—of another on mice that expressed human cell receptors. In one case, the NIH reported last fall, one of the chimeric viruses caused mice to become “sicker.” EcoHealth reports show that in the infection experiments, conducted in years four and five of the grant, chimeric viruses replicated faster in mice lungs and killed a higher percentage of mice than the unmodified virus. Last fall, the NIH said that EcoHealth was supposed to report the increased viral growth to the agency “immediately” to assess whether further biosafety measures were necessary.\n\nThe NIH said the Wuhan institute’s experiments under the EcoHealth grant involved viruses that were too genetically distant to have evolved to become SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But some critics of so-called gain-of-function experimentation—in which pathogens are enhanced in way that makes them, say, more transmissible—have said last fall’s revelations point to risky research projects being undertaken at the laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the first reported cases of COVID were reported. Research published recently in Science points to the pandemic having sprung from a seafood market in the city where animals that could have harbored coronavirus infections were kept. That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth has not responded to a request for comment about NIH’s decision to partially terminate its grant.\n\nAccording to the new NIH letters, EcoHealth can work with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to revise the grants without involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins steered scientists investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic away from the idea that the virus was created in a lab in Wuhan, China.\n\nIn a report released in advance of the hearing, Democrats highlighted sworn testimony by authors of the “Proximal Origin” paper that was published in March 2020 in the journal Nature – the paper that first concluded that the pandemic was most likely caused by a viral spillover event from animals to humans.\n\nThat testimony, they said, shows that Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British biomedical scientist who was then director of the Wellcome Trust health research charity and is now chief scientist for the World Health Organization, organized and led the scientific effort that produced both that paper and the February conference call that laid the groundwork for it, rather than Fauci or Collins. Fauci was then head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Collins was head of the National Institutes of Health. Both played critical roles in the nation’s pandemic response.\n\nThe conference call and the paper have become fodder for conspiracy theories claiming that Fauci and Collins pressured scientists to abandon the “lab leak” theory in favor of the natural origins hypothesis.\n\nDr. Kristian Andersen, who studies the genetics of infectious diseases at the Scripps Research Institute, testified Tuesday that in the early days of the pandemic, he first thought the virus that causes Covid-19 had genomic features that might have pointed to laboratory manipulation.\n\n“My initial hypothesis was that SARS-CoV-2 was likely an engineered virus,” Andersen told the committee. “This was based on limited data and preliminary analyses where I had observed features that appeared to be unique.”\n\nHe shared those early concerns with Fauci, who advised him to draft a scientific paper outlining his theory. But Andersen said he changed his mind after learning more about these kinds of viruses.\n\n“We soon discovered that those features are readily found in related coronaviruses, and the virus itself looks to be a clear product of natural selection and not actual engineering,” he said.\n\nHe said scientists often adjust their thinking in the face of evidence. It’s not a flip-flop but how the scientific process works.\n\nAndersen, who said he found his name on online “kill lists” because of allegations that he was part of a coverup, also disputed allegations that he and his co-authors were bribed to change their public statements with promises of grant money.\n\n“It has also been suggested that a grant awarded to myself and colleagues from five different countries was a quid pro quo for changing our conclusions. These allegations are false,” he said.\n\nRepublicans on the committee weren’t happy with those explanations.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican, pressed Andersen to explain the change in his thinking.\n\n“Within a matter of days, something changed,” she said, between Andersen’s emails and calls to Fauci in late January 2020 and the February 1, 2020, conference call with about a dozen other researchers from around the world. “And that’s what this committee is trying to get to the bottom of. What happened within that three-day period between the conference call and the paper that all of a sudden you did a 180, and it couldn’t possibly come from a lab?” she asked. “What happened in those three days?”\n\nDr. Robert Garry, a microbiologist and immunologist at Tulane University, explained that they examined the genomes of other coronaviruses.\n\n“Well, we examined the genomes more closely. We looked at other coronaviruses. And there was some new data that came. There was the data come from the scientific literature,” he said.\n\nGarry said the publication of a similar coronavirus isolated from animals called pangolins showed some of the same changes as the virus that eventually infected humans.\n\n“It was a very important piece of data, because it showed that a lot of the theories about the virus having been engineered or put together in a laboratory were not true, because here was a virus in nature that had a receptor-binding domain with exactly” the same features, he said.\n\nAndersen said the genetic adaptation that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans was “suboptimal,” suggesting to him that it was of natural origin. If the virus had been engineered in a lab, he said, the changes probably would have been more precise.\n\nAndersen also pushed back on the timeline repeated by Republicans on the committee: He said he didn’t change his mind in three days but within about 45 days, as he drafted the Nature paper.\n\nBoth scientists said that if convincing evidence were to emerge that supported the theory that the virus came from lab manipulation, they would consider it.\n\n“It is still my opinion that there is no credible scientific evidence for a lab-based origin for SARS-CoV-2,” Garry said.\n\nRep. John Joyce, a Republican physician from Pennsylvania, asked how some US intelligence agencies – namely the Department of Energy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation – had concluded that the virus probably came from a lab.\n\n“Dr. Andersen, you also said in your testimony, ‘we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,’ and yet two conclusions by the Department of Energy and the FBI directly contradict your position. How do you bring that together?” Joyce said.\n\n“I think you could say that our conclusions completely contradict their conclusions, too,” Andersen said. “I think it’s important to understand that we’re looking at different things here. You’re talking about the intelligence community. If you look at the scientific literature, the scientific evidence for this pointing to a single market in the middle of Wuhan is overwhelming.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Raul Ruiz, an ER doctor who is ranking member of the committee, said that months of the panel’s work had been a biased effort that had shed no additional light on the pandemic’s origins but had sown mistrust in science and the nation’s scientists.\n\n“We have undertaken all of this work, but to what end? Has targeting these researchers and probing the publication of this paper meaningfully advanced our efforts to prevent and prepare for future pandemics?” he asked.\n\n“Or has it been about fishing for evidence to prove their confirmation bias, their theories with a goal of advancing a predetermined partisan narrative targeting Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins and our nation’s scientists and public health officials.”\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, chided her Republican colleagues for feeding public hatred of scientists and public servants.\n\n“I am so offended by some of the things I’ve heard today, of baseless allegations against our nation’s scientists, our public health experts, including Drs. Fauci and Collins, and instead of being on a mission to destroy two people, I wish we were on a mission to get the facts,” she said.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.science.org/content/article/why-the-us-has-banned-funding-for-chinese-lab-at-center-of-pandemic-origin-dispute', 'Headline': 'Explainer: Why the U.S. has banned funding for Chinese lab at ... - AAAS', 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump alleged in April 2020 that SARS-CoV-2 came from WIV and directed NIH to cancel the grant to EcoHealth, which it did, triggering a controversy.

The work was approved by the institutional biosafety committee of BU’s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, and by Boston’s Public Health Commission.\n\nadvertisement\n\nScientists from the BU facility posted results from their work in a preprint, a study that has yet to go through peer review. The British tabloid The Daily Mail published an explosive article about the work on Monday, suggesting the group had fabricated a more dangerous version of the SARS-2 Omicron variant.\n\nIn response to questioning from STAT, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which had awarded two grants to the research group, said on Monday that it should have been informed about the nature of the work beforehand, in order for a review to be conducted.\n\nNewsletters\n\nSign up for Daily Recap\n\nA roundup of STAT's top stories of the day.\n\nPlease enter a valid email address.\n\nEmily Erbelding, director of NIAID’s division of microbiology and infectious diseases, said that is the policy set out in what’s known as the P3CO framework, which lays out the rules for work that could lead to enhancement of dangerous pathogens.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“What we would have wanted to do is to talk about exactly what they wanted to do in advance, and if it met what the P3CO framework defines as enhanced pathogen of pandemic potential, ePPP, we could have put a package forward for review by the committee that’s convened by HHS, the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response. That’s what the framework lays out and that’s what we would have done,” she said.\n\nBut the policy only applies to work of this type that is funded by the federal government. And NIAID money was not used for this research, Corley said.\n\nSome funding from NIAID went towards work that might be considered foundational to the questioned research. Corley said the team used some of the federal funds to develop a system for making plasmids it would need to do the later work.\n\nHe acknowledged it can be difficult to see where lines are drawn, when research groups are using different pots of money to fund their work.\n\n“It is a murky world, but in our view because the funding was not supporting the work that was supported in this paper, that it wasn’t necessary to report it to NIH,” he said.\n\nSTAT asked the NIAID if it was satisfied with Boston University’s response. The agency’s response, received by email on Tuesday evening, did not directly answer the question, though it indicated the situation is still being investigated.\n\n“NIH is examining the matter to determine whether the research conducted was subject to the NIH Grants Policy Statement or met the criteria for review under the HHS Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (HHS P3CO framework),” the statement said.\n\nCorley also challenged the notion that the work done by scientist Mohsan Saeed and colleagues was what is known as “gain of function” research. The group created a hybrid or chimeric virus — in which the spike protein of an Omicron version of SARS-2 was fused to a virus of the Wuhan strain, the original version that emerged from China in 2020. Omicron viruses first emerged in late 2021 and have since splintered into multiple different subvariants.\n\nThe purpose of the work was to see if the mutations in the Omicron spike protein were responsible for the lower rate of severity caused by Omicron viruses.\n\nThe testing actually showed, though, that the chimeric virus was more lethal to a type of lab mice than Omicron itself, killing 80% of the mice infected. But the original Wuhan strain killed 100% of mice it was tested in. That suggests that the spike protein itself is not responsible for the pathogenicity of SARS-2 viruses, Corley said.\n\nHe noted that because the chimeric virus was less dangerous in mice than the original strain, this work could not be characterized as gain of function research. That is unlikely to assuage critics of the work, who may argue that the Wuhan strain is not the right benchmark to use as a comparison, given that it no longer circulates. The chimeric virus was more pathogenic than the currently circulating SARS-2 viruses, which are Omicron variants.\n\nBut it is important to note that the severity in the species of mice used in the experiment is not reflective of what happens in people. All of the mice exposed to the original SARS-2 viruses died. Less than 1% of people who contracted those viruses died.\n\nCorley said that BU safety protocols require that if researchers produce a pathogen that is more virulent than the Wuhan strains, they must immediately report it to the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Saeed’s study protocol further stipulated that if such an event occurred, he would immediately stop the work and destroy the viruses, Corley noted.\n\nSTAT approached Saeed for an interview but he did not respond to the request.\n\nCorley said the principal investigators of the study — Saeed is one of two — spoke Tuesday with their program managers at the NIH.\n\n“They support the work that we’re doing and we certainly want to make sure that we are on comfortable ground,” Corley said.\n\n— This article has been updated with a comment from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01566-0', 'Headline': 'NIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research - Nature', 'Snippet': 'NIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research EcoHealth Alliance lost funding during the Trump administration, but can now proceed with its research — under extensive restrictions.

From mid-April, focus shifted to the US, where the number of deaths has remained consistently high, although the focus of the epidemic has shifted from the northeast to other regions of the country. Latin America became the epicentre of the pandemic in the summer of 2020, with the region accounting for almost a half of deaths each day. However, the surge in Europe since the autumn means Covid-19 remains a global pandemic.\n\nWith several vaccines approved for use, the race is now on for countries to vaccinate their populations:\n\nThere are concerns, however, that reported Covid-19 deaths are not capturing the true impact of coronavirus on mortality around the world. The FT has gathered and analysed data on excess mortality — the numbers of deaths over and above the historical average — across the globe, and has found that numbers of deaths in some countries are more than 50 per cent higher than usual. In many countries, these excess deaths exceed reported numbers of Covid-19 deaths by large margins.\n\nThere are several different ways of comparing excess deaths figures between countries. In absolute numbers, more people than would usually be expected have died in the in the US than in any of the other countries for which recent all-cause mortality data is available.\n\nAdjusting for typical mortality rates, the five hardest hit countries worldwide where data is available are all in Latin America. Peru has seen more than double the number of deaths it sees in a typical year, and neighbouring Ecuador has seen a 67 per cent increase. Nicaragua (a 59 per cent rise), Bolivia (56) and Mexico (55) complete the top five.\n\nReporting, data analysis and graphics by Steven Bernard, David Blood, John Burn-Murdoch, Oliver Elliott, Max Harlow, Joanna S Kao, William Rohde Madsen, Caroline Nevitt, Alan Smith, Martin Stabe, Cale Tilford and Aleksandra Wisniewska.

""If a person wanted to be vaccinated, that person would have to go to the south. So drive around 15 to 20 hours crossing front lines in the mountains."" Even then, after such a treacherous journey through a war zone, it\'s not clear if doses would be available. Like many low-income countries, Yemen has struggled to get hold of vaccine.\n\nLoading...\n\n""Yemen has been one of the places with the lowest vaccination rates in the world,"" says Lavoie. ""And that\'s despite the fact that we\'ve experienced three waves of COVID."" Currently fewer than 2% of Yemenis are fully vaccinated.\n\nYemen is one of 36 countries that fall below the 10% immunization threshold, some with rates under 2%. Much of the mid-section of Africa is in that category, including powerful economic and political players like Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nBy contrast, many wealthy countries have fully vaccinated more than 80% of their citizens.\n\nWhy Africa lags so far behind\n\nMaaza Seyoum with the African Alliance, a South Africa-based advocacy group, says there are many factors playing in to the low vaccination rates in many countries on the continent but the biggest issue is simply that African nations have struggled to get doses.\n\n""Initially, 100 percent, I would say the problem was a lack of access (to vaccines) and a global system that did not prioritize African countries,"" Maaza says. Wealthy nations bought up far more pharmaceutical firms vaccine production than they could even use. The WHO-backed COVAX program faltered as it relied heavily on voluntary donations and on manufacturers in India who were blocked from exporting doses when COVID case numbers skyrocketed on the sub-continent. Some African countries managed to get supplies from China but Beijing often prioritized donations to wealthier trading partners.\n\nThat situation has changed, says Maaza. Recently vaccine deliveries to Africa have increased. But now there are new problems: the shipments are haphazard and sometimes consist of less popular brands that are about to expire.\n\n""Now we\'re seeing the sort of drip, drip, drip of vaccines,"" she says. ""People are waiting for vaccines to come. They come, then they stop.""\n\nThis unpredictable supply chain, she says, makes it nearly impossible for African countries to plan nationwide vaccination drives. And in some of these places where hardly anyone has gotten the jab, rumors about the mysterious vaccine have flourished and augmented vaccine hesitancy.\n\n""The truth is, there is vaccine hesitancy everywhere,"" Maaza says. ""But as people are waiting, it leaves kind of a fertile ground for these rumors to circulate.""\n\nWhich makes convincing people to come to a clinic and get immunized even more of a challenge.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhat\'s behind those under 10% vaccination numbers\n\nThe World Health Organization set a goal of trying to push all countries to 40% vaccine coverage by the end of 2021. The 36 countries still under 10% obviously didn\'t even get close. Kate O\'Brien, the director of immunization and vaccines for the World Health Organization, says this is a significant problem.\n\n""For countries that are struggling to get even above 10%, what this means is that health-care workers are not fully vaccinated yet,"" she says. ""It means older age populations, those who have underlying medical conditions, the people at highest risk are not fully protected yet.""\n\nShe acknowledges vaccine supply inequity as a major part of why rates are so low in these three dozen countries but says there are other reasons too. Many of these countries had health systems that were struggling even before the pandemic to meet local medical needs. Some of them have needed to upgrade refrigeration systems to be able to store certain mRNA vaccines at extremely low temperatures. Others need syringes. All of this takes money that many low-income nations health ministries may not have.\n\n""A COVID vaccine campaign does require funding,"" O\'Brien says. Countries need money ""to deploy new health workers and to assure that the clinics have the resources that they need.""\n\nAnd while there has been some international assistance to lower-income nations to help, that financing has also at times been haphazard and unpredictable.\n\nOngoing conflicts present another obstacle\n\nAway from Africa, the other nations that haven\'t yet gotten above 10% COVID vaccine coverage are some of the most troubled in the world, including Yemen as well as Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti.\n\nCurrently the armed conflict has displaced 4 million of 30 million Yemenis from their homes. Various groups control different parts of the country. According to the U.N. more than 2/3rds of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance. Yet international aid agencies have struggled to meet those needs and keep their operations running in the country due to the ongoing insecurity and a lack of funding.\n\nFor most people in Yemen, life is incredibly difficult. COVID vaccinations are ""not on the top of the list of priorities for many people in Yemen,"" Jasmin Lavoie with NRC says. He says most Yemenis spend their days trying to find food, shelter, decent toilets and worrying about whether they\'ll have to flee fighting once again. ""These are reasons why people are not getting vaccinated too,"" he adds.\n\nThere are similar issues in other conflict zones.

In Portugal, where 88 percent of the population is fully vaccinated ...', 'Full_text': 'As the Omicron variant sweeps across the planet, the global tally of new coronavirus cases has for the first time passed one million per day on average. The previous global case record set last April has already been broken three times this week.\n\nThe United States, Canada and much of Western Europe are leading the surge, with both regions seeing record-breaking levels of new coronavirus cases. The daily average number of new cases in the United States on Tuesday was more than 267,000, exceeding the previous all-time peak set in January; Wednesday’s average was higher still, at more than 300,000.\n\nNew cases in at least 11 European countries — Britain, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain and Switzerland — also passed their previous all-time peaks on Tuesday or Wednesday. In France, the daily case average passed 100,000.\n\nCases in Canada have also seen a steep increase in recent days, more than doubling in a week to an average of more than 25,000. And Australia’s cases climbed to an average of more than 12,600 on Wednesday — eight times as high as just three weeks earlier.\n\nAs dramatic as these case counts are, they are also likely an undercount because of asymptomatic cases, reporting lags due to the holiday season, lack of test availability in many places and at-home tests whose results may not be reported.\n\nIn the United States, where Omicron is spreading quickly, 16 states and Puerto Rico are at their all-time case records. These include states with comparatively high vaccination rates: Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island, all of which are at least 70 percent fully vaccinated. In addition to being more transmissible generally, Omicron also appears to give rise to more breakthrough infections.\n\nSimilarly, some of the European countries currently facing serious surges have among the world’s highest vaccination rates. In Portugal, where 88 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, cases are up more than 200 percent in the past two weeks. Spain, where new cases have more than quintupled in the past three weeks, is 80 percent fully vaccinated.\n\nSo far, overall hospitalization and death rates have not come close to reaching previous peak levels, though some places are struggling. About 78,000 people in the United States are hospitalized with the virus, compared with over 130,000 at the height of last winter’s peak. The average daily rate of deaths across much of the world also remains lower than the record rates seen earlier in the pandemic.\n\nA combination of immunity from vaccines, booster shots and previous infections is most likely at least partially responsible for lower hospitalization and mortality. Encouraging early data also suggests the Omicron variant may be less virulent than previous strains of the virus.\n\nThe recent surges in all these places, however, have been fast and steep, and severe outcomes usually lag case spikes by at least a few weeks, so hospitalizations and death rates may rise in the coming days.\n\n“This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse and again disrupting lives and livelihoods,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said at a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nCase rates in South America, Asia and much of Africa have so far remained relatively low. And at least some countries that saw record case loads this month may be turning a corner. In southern Africa, where scientists first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization, cases remain higher than on the rest of the continent but appear to be abating.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. health officials continued to stress the importance of vaccination and booster doses. In a White House news briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that people eligible for a booster shot who have not yet gotten one “do have some protection against severe disease and death,” though she added that “they do have quite a bit of waning with regard to protection against infection.”\n\nThat group with waning immunity comprises those who completed a Moderna or Pfizer two-dose series six months ago or more, or received a Johnson & Johnson shot at least two months ago.\n\nAlthough Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, discouraged large New Year’s Eve parties, his advice in the news conference Wednesday was more measured when it came to small gatherings of vaccinated people.\n\n“Although the risk is never zero in anything, the risk is low enough that we feel you should continue to go through with those plans of having a home-related, vaccinated, boosted gathering with family and close friends who are also vaccinated and boosted,” he said.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01615-8', 'Headline': 'A panel dataset of COVID-19 vaccination policies in 185 countries - Nature', 'Snippet': 'We present a panel dataset of COVID-19 vaccine policies, with data from 01 January 2020 for 185 countries and a number of subnational jurisdictions, reporting on vaccination prioritization plans ...', 'Full_text': 'The COVID-19 pandemic drove an unprecedented effort to develop and deploy vaccines at scale. As of 15 June 2022, 37 COVID-19 vaccines were in Phase 3 clinical trials, authorized for early use or approved for full use (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html), with some available for use in infants as young as 6 months old1,2. Eleven vaccines have now been given Emergency Use Listing (EUL) from the World Health Organization (WHO)3, and more than 11.9 billion (as of 15 June 2022, https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL) COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered worldwide4,5,6. Nonetheless, more than 30% of the world population remains unvaccinated3, and COVID-19 vaccines and public health measures to promote them have generated substantial political controversy in many countries7.\n\nGiven that vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases will continue to play a critical role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and future diseases, there is an enormous need to better understand both how governments use vaccines and the factors that drive or inhibit uptake. Within the latter, the policies and measures that governments adopt to promote vaccination play an important role. This resource article introduces a new dataset from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) project8 that provides cross-national and longitudinal information on COVID-19 vaccination policies across the world. The new dataset covers vaccine prioritization policies (V1), vaccine availability and eligibility by group (V2), whether there is a cost to individual recipients at the point of use (V3) and mandate policies (V4) (Table 1). Developed in consultation with governments, policymakers, stakeholders in the field and the OxCGRT expert advisory board, this dataset allows researchers and policymakers to systematically compare government vaccination strategies and assess distributional capabilities (see Methods for more information on dataset design). Through combination with other datasets, further analyses, such as on the impact of distribution policies on uptake, are made possible.\n\nThe dataset is composed of four indicators that report national-level COVID-19 vaccination policies for 52 population categories from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022 for 185 jurisdictions in the national database, as well as subnational jurisdictions (provinces) for Canada and (states) for the United States (subnational-jurisdiction data for other countries are in development and will be added to the online data repository as they become available). Collected by a specially trained team of OxCGRT volunteer data contributors, the dataset has been reviewed for quality assurance and accuracy by core OxCGRT researchers and a specially trained review team. The results presented here focus only on the national-level data. The 52 population categories include general and at-risk age groups (in 5-yr intervals for individuals over 16 yr), occupational categories (based on exposure and transmission risk and economic function—groups of people working in occupations critical to the economic function of the country, including essential workers and airport/border staff) and medical categories (based on vulnerability) (Table 2). These closely reflect the categories listed in the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) values framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, a framework that guides the allocation of vaccinations under limited supply to specific population groups to meet specific outcomes.\n\nHere we present some variations and temporal patterns of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization, eligibility, distribution, cost and mandates by group, with the aim of illustrating how the new dataset can offer insights for researchers and policymakers. By mapping variation in vaccination policies over time, this dataset provides a means of responding to critical questions about the role of vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic. The four indicators are presented in the dataset alongside vaccination rates so that users can easily generate cross-national and within-country comparisons to explore associations between vaccination policies, those prioritized for vaccination and vaccine uptake. The dataset’s jurisdiction–day format purposefully facilitates merging with other data sources. For example, combining these four vaccine policy indicators with data about other kinds of pandemic policies—relating to closures, economic support and health, such as testing—allows for assessment of the interplay of vaccination programmes within the broader context of pandemic management. Combining these data with other social science indicators broadens the possibilities further, towards considerations of the impacts of vaccination policies in different economic, political, cultural or religious contexts, and how controversies towards COVID-19 vaccines may have shaped policy. Comparisons between countries with similar demographics, or those with unique demographics and geography might highlight best practice for future pandemics10.\n\nTo motivate use of this new dataset, in this section we illustrate some initial observations using the four vaccine policy indicators. First, we focus on the first two indicators (V1 and V2). We note common patterns in vaccination prioritization strategies according to the broader strategies guiding countries’ pandemic management, and by country income level. We then observe country-level variation in both prioritization and actual distribution by age group and other kinds of vulnerability categories. Second, we consider the additional two indicators (V3 and V4), briefly discussing the cost of vaccination to individuals, before exploring vaccine mandate policies. Although we find limited variation relating to cost across countries—almost all countries provided the vaccine to people free of charge—we detail the diversity of countries’ vaccine mandate policies, ranging from non-existent, to policies specific to certain age groups, occupation groups and populations carrying out specific religious activities, or working in named locations.\n\nComparing countries’ prioritization plans\n\nThe vaccine prioritization (V1) indicator captures the order in which governments planned to deploy COVID-19 vaccines to different categories of people. It depicts the published plans of all countries in the OxCGRT dataset (only Eritrea, of 185 countries, has yet to begin COVID-19 vaccinations or publish a vaccination plan). These plans were primarily used to ration limited supplies at a time when global vaccine supply was constrained. As such, they help reveal the evolving priorities governments held for vaccine deployment.\n\nBroadly, we can distinguish two ideal typical COVID-19 strategies: elimination and mitigation. Roughly, studies have categorized these strategies by observing how eliminators aimed to keep the virus out of the country and to prevent community transmission. In contrast, mitigators sought to reduce the impact of community transmission by flattening the curve and reducing cases and deaths11,12,13,14. Many countries in the WHO West Pacific Region adopted policies closer to the elimination model, perhaps in part due to the region’s previous experience with SARS11,13. Relatedly, it has also been hypothesized that island nations may have been more likely to pursue elimination models during COVID-19 due to their geographical advantage of isolation and ability to seal national borders, although for many low-income countries (LICs) and LMICs, this came at appreciable economic cost11,15,16,17,18. Finally, early responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have also highlighted distinctions between mitigation and elimination strategies based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, such as high-performing surveillance systems with early and targeted contact tracing and widespread efficient testing in eliminator countries12,14.\n\nInterestingly, we observe a clear distinction in the vaccination rollout strategies of countries that have been characterized as pursuing an elimination strategy throughout much of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to countries that pursued a mitigation strategy11,12,13,14,19. Table 3 highlights how nine selected eliminators (selected as examples from a comprehensive list of eliminators, see Supplementary Table 3), such as Australia and New Zealand, prioritized frontline workers and border staff alongside clinically vulnerable people (those with co-morbidities and/or predispositions to illness) in their first rounds of vaccination (that is, positioned rank 1), while nine selected mitigators (see Supplementary Table 3 for comprehensive list of mitigators) focused instead on vaccinating only clinically vulnerable and elderly populations, along with healthcare workers. Looking across all countries in our dataset, while 11 out of 19 (58%) Western Pacific countries prioritized first-round vaccinations on the basis of economic function, only 42 out of 164 (26%) non-Western Pacific countries did so. When looking at the OECD subset, we observe the same pattern: 2 out of 5 countries that adopted elimination in the early stages of the pandemic (40%) prioritized vaccination on the basis of economic function versus 4 out of 32 (12%) mitigators. Finally, the same descriptive pattern holds for island nations (16 out of 32, 50%) when contrasted to non-island nations, with 16 (50%) island countries adopting economic function prioritized vaccination versus non-island countries (38 out of 151, 25%). In contrast, only 3 Western Pacific countries (16%) prioritized clinically vulnerable people, versus 80 (49%) for countries outside the region. However, we observe no differences in descriptive patterns for either OECD or island country groupings. While 3 out of 5 OECD countries that adopted elimination strategies in the early stages of the pandemic (60%) prioritized clinically vulnerable people, 19 out of 32 mitigators did so. Finally, 44% of island (14 out of 32) and 46% of non-island countries (70 out of 151) prioritized clinically vulnerable people.\n\nWhen we map country differences in the most- (or equal-most-) prioritized categories of people (Fig. 1), we observe that almost all countries in our dataset placed healthcare workers among the first to receive COVID-19 vaccines (91% of countries, or 168/185) presumably both to reduce transmission and mitigate health impacts for those at high risk of exposure. Following healthcare workers, 54% (101) of countries also prioritized populations deemed to be clinically vulnerable. Seventy-four countries (40%) prioritized groups of people critical to the economic function of the country, 45 prioritized (24%) categories related to the public function of the country, and 27 countries (15%) focused on educators and/or students for COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nComparing countries’ plans with actual distribution\n\nBy the end of 2021, 62 (34%) countries had published COVID-19 vaccination rollout plans and prioritization lists, often with rough estimates for the timing of each phase. Of those, 48 countries began vaccination before the end of 2021 (Fig. 2), and by 31 March 2021, 107 more countries had published their COVID-19 vaccination plans and priorities. In countries with access to vaccines, deployment swiftly followed plans (captured by indicator V2, which records the groups actually receiving a vaccine in a country). Because vaccine access was highly related to countries’ income levels20, Fig. 2 groups countries according to the World Bank income classification groups for 2021 (https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html). HICs were the first to publish vaccination plans to secure COVID-19 vaccines and to begin administration of vaccines for their populations, reflecting their greater ability to produce and purchase vaccines. Figure 2 shows that the publication of plans and subsequent administration of vaccine doses then followed in upper middle-income countries (UMICs), LMICs and then LICs, respectively. HICs moved quicker to expand vaccination eligibility to the 12+ yr age group than LMICs. It also shows that despite publishing plans and beginning vaccinations at later dates than HICs and UMICs, some LMICs and LICs quickly moved from prioritized vaccinations by age or occupation to universal access (defined in our dataset as being available widely to all those over the age of 16+ yr or 18+ yr, with age floor dependent on vaccine brand). LMICs and LICs have had far fewer vaccine doses available to them than HICs and UMICs (https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/accessibility/), so one possible explanation for the swift movement towards universal access in LICs and LMICs may be an attempt to vaccinate larger proportions of their populations in the face of vaccine hesitancy. However, there are conflicting views on whether LMICs and LICs are more or less vaccine hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccines than HICs and UMICs21,22,23. Another possible explanation for the quick move to (ostensibly) universal access (despite low vaccine supply) may have been to reduce public perception of favouring or excluding certain groups in the face of a public health emergency and with varying social and geographic challenges in the distribution of vaccines24,25.\n\nComparing categories by age and vulnerability status\n\nOnly 11 countries in our dataset did not specifically prioritize elderly populations (the age cut-off for ‘elderly’ is defined locally, see Methods) in their plans and rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Macau, Namibia, Russia, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Uruguay, Zimbabwe and Taiwan). Long-term care facilities (LTCFs; nursing homes, elderly care homes and so on) are a concept and cultural phenomenon predominantly found in some relatively wealthy countries26. This is reflected in our data (Fig. 3), with most African, South Asian and Middle East countries not prioritizing LTCFs in their plans and rollouts. In contrast, while not prioritizing its elderly population in general, Russia did prioritize vaccinations at LTCFs for elderly people before moving to universal eligibility.\n\nAt the younger end of the age scale, children and infants were not included in initial COVID-19 prioritization plans and indeed, the WHO stated that children were a lower priority group as they are less likely to experience serious symptoms27. Clinical research into the safety and efficacy of vaccines in children came later28. Because clinical trials split children into groups of young children (~5–11 yr,) and adolescents (~12–17 yr)29, many countries’ regulatory agencies approved COVID-19 vaccines for children in similar age groups at around the same time as research emerged and as vaccine supplies allowed (Fig. 2). Children 12 and above first became eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations on 6 May 2021 in the territory of Nunavut, Canada, and Bahrain made the COVID-19 vaccine available to children aged 3+ yr on 17 August 2021. As of 15 June 2022, only 12 countries were vaccinating infants (children aged 0–4 yr), 6 being Central and South American countries (Fig. 3), and 26 countries in our dataset have not been recorded as vaccinating children or infants (ages 0–15 yr).\n\nCountries prioritized many professional categories, some of which (for example, healthcare workers) were gendered to varying extents in different countries. Pregnant people were first made eligible for vaccinations in 2021. They were not initially prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination due to a lack of clinical trial data on the effect on unborn children and pregnant people. From January 2020 to 15 June 2022, 21 countries explicitly prioritized pregnant people in their official vaccination rollout plans (V1) (Fig. 4), and 54 out of 185 countries reported specifically administering vaccinations to pregnant people during their vaccination rollouts (V2).\n\nSimilarly, strikingly few countries have prioritized refugees, migrants and ethnic minorities in their COVID-19 vaccination plans or actual rollouts (Fig. 4), despite reports of disparities in the risk of COVID-19 infections and in health outcomes among these groups30,31,32,33,34. Australia, Brazil, Canada and New Zealand all prioritized Indigenous populations in their plans and administration of COVID-19 vaccines (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, Indigenous People, traditional riverine and quilombola communities in Brazil, First Nations in Canada, Māori and Pacific People and their extended families/whanau that care for them in New Zealand). In early June 2021, Greece began a vaccination programme specifically for refugees starting with the island refugee camps, then moving to the mainland camps. Some African countries with high rates of internal migration have prioritized the vaccination of migrants and ‘travellers’ (a term sometimes used for migrants) (Fig. 4)(https://africacenter.org/spotlight/african-migration-trends-to-watch-in-2022/). Many other countries may have made COVID-19 vaccines available to refugees and migrants but may not have explicitly noted this in official documentation.\n\nVaccine cost and mandates\n\nThe dataset reveals that nearly all countries provided the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge to individuals at the point of delivery (V3). From data freely available online from government sources, we observed that Botswana, India, Pakistan and Turkmenistan required a small fee for COVID-19 vaccination from individuals, in some circumstances. In Taiwan, vaccines were free for those meeting eligibility criteria, but individuals could self-fund vaccination in advance of becoming eligible for free vaccines. Some countries enabled individuals to acquire the vaccination privately if they wished or encouraged vaccine tourism in efforts to boost tourism during the pandemic. In late 2021, Russian tourists were accessing free non-Sputnik vaccines in Croatia via specially arranged tours35. Not long after, Russia began to offer their Sputnik COVID-19 vaccine at a cost to tourists (although visas to visit the country were an issue for some)36. Cities and states of the United States, Indonesia, Cuba, the Maldives and the UAE began to use free COVID-19 vaccinations to increase tourism, and travel agencies in the United Kingdom, India and the United States (among others) offered package deals for individuals not yet eligible in their own country to access the vaccine in another37,38,39. These cases are not recorded in our V3 ordinal indicator data but are captured in qualitative coding notes within the dataset.\n\nWe define mandatory COVID-19 vaccination as a government policy requirement to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to work in a specific occupation, or for a specific age group of citizens to be vaccinated. We see these policies as distinct from COVID-19 passports or certification to gain entry to non-essential services or for international travel based on demonstrating immunity or negative test results. These ‘passport’ style policies are defined in the OxCGRT database as ‘differentiated policies’ and are part of the OxCGRT Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) dataset8,40. For 10 of these original indicators, we report two policies, one for vaccinated and another for non-vaccinated individuals, viewing requirements to present passes as a de facto closure (see online documentation and Methods for further detail).\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine mandates (V4) were first introduced in Jakarta, Indonesia, in February 2021 for all adults41. As of 15 June 2022, 55 countries (29%) of our dataset have currently, or had at one time, at least one vaccine mandate policy. Figure 5 shows that mandatory vaccination policies accelerated in implementation around July 2021, commonly according to occupation (83%), with age-based mandates being far less widespread (17%).\n\nThe most common groups to have been mandated for COVID-19 vaccination were related to occupation: government officials (36), healthcare workers (29), staff at LTCFs (15) and educators (22). Hence, in most countries, mandates only affected a small and specific proportion of the population, as opposed to COVID-19 passports which affected the whole population to control their access to services. Six countries (Germany, Ethiopia, Kuwait, New Zealand, Russia and Tonga) mandated vaccines for socially vulnerable and or other vulnerable populations (see Table 2). Nine countries, including Indonesia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan mandated COVID-19 vaccination for the entire adult population. Ecuador mandated vaccination for all those over 5 yr and in Costa Rica, all those aged 3–18 yr must be vaccinated (""×"" symbol in Fig. 5). The qualitative notes section of this new vaccine dataset records how some countries introduced specific vaccine mandates for particular groups relevant to their local context, such as those observing the Hajj in Saudi Arabia, Jahh in Bangladesh, and maritime and port workers in Singapore.\n\nIn this section we describe the design, structure, collection, publication and review of the panel dataset of COVID-19 vaccine policies, with the jurisdiction–day as the unit of analysis. All OxCGRT data are available on GitHub and are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution CC BY standard. Data users should refer to the project website for updated documentation and methodologies (https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker). Excel (v.16), Stata (v.17.0) and R (v.4.1.3) software were used for all analysis and images produced in this resource article.\n\nIndicators\n\nIn late 2020, the OxCGRT team began to consider the COVID-19 vaccine policies and strategies that might be deployed globally. Extensive consultations with government officials, policymakers, experts and stakeholders in the relevant fields, consideration of critical gaps in existing data at the time, and capacity to collect such information resulted in a focus on four priority policies to measure (vaccine indicators V1–V4): who was prioritized for vaccines, who was eligible and receiving vaccines and in what order, who was paying for vaccines, and who was mandated to be vaccinated. Additional indicators for future consideration could include which vaccines were approved/deployed in each country, prioritization for additional/booster vaccinations, vaccine dose timing (manufacturer recommendations vs timeline chosen by country for subsequent doses), government vaccination incentives, vaccination education strategies/programmes and internal vs external funding for vaccines.\n\nVaccine prioritization (V1) records the ranked position for different groups within a country’s prioritization plan. This is the official plan of the official order in which categories are to be vaccinated. This is recorded regardless of whether a country has capacity to distribute and administer vaccines. Vaccination eligibility/availability (V2) is a categorical/binary variable that records which categories of people, regardless of their position in a prioritized rollout plan, are currently receiving vaccinations. This is recorded as a non-zero value if there is evidence that people in this category are being vaccinated, whether this is happening in a targeted geographical region or nationwide. There must be de facto evidence that this is happening to record a non-zero value in V2. For ‘elderly’ groups, we used local elderly age definitions using qualitative notes where available. In the absence of local guidance on elderly age range, a default of 65+ yr was used. Vaccine financial support (V3) is recorded on an ordinal scale. It reports how vaccines are funded for each category selected in V2 as currently receiving vaccination (1 for full cost to individual, 2 for partially funded by government, 3 for fully funded by government/free). Mandatory vaccination (V4) is a binary variable which reports the existence of a requirement for a category of people to be vaccinated. These are government policy requirements to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to work in a specific occupation, or for a specific group to be vaccinated. This is a mandatory vaccination required as part of occupation or citizenship, and we do not record policies that only ‘encourage’ voluntary vaccination to access non-essential services, facilities or freedoms. For example, if healthcare workers must be vaccinated to attend their place of work, this is recorded in V4. As detailed in our interpretation guidance, if there is a vaccine mandate in place for workers of certain occupations, and non-vaccinated people in this occupation have the option of testing regularly to opt out of vaccination, we still record this as a mandate in V4. If vaccination is mandatory in a subnational region as a result of an official national or local government policy, we record this in V4. We do not report enforcement of vaccine mandates, just the policy.\n\nThe vaccination policy dataset also contains summary indicators. These use an ordinal scale to report one number per indicator to offer a succinct summary on the basis of data entered for variables in the main V1–V4 dataset. These are summarized in our codebook (see Supplementary Information). V2, V3 and V4 policies are reported as non-zero values on the date when the policy came into effect, as opposed to the date they were announced. We report the V1 government rollout prioritization plan on the date the policy was published. For the analysis in this paper, the detailed qualitative notes section was used to manually find specific age floors for when different ages became eligible for vaccination, rather than using the age ranges in the quantitative data due to the limitations described above.\n\nIn March 2022, the OxCGRT NPI dataset and data structure was altered to reflect the different policies for unvaccinated and vaccinated people (for COVID-19), where passes or proof of either negative testing or vaccination were required to access different areas of public life (https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-scratchpad/tree/master/differentiated_vaccination_policies). For ten indicators (C1–8, H6 and H8), both the policy values for non-vaccinated and vaccinated people are reported if there are different policies in place. If there is no differentiation, one value is reported. These differentiated values relate only to ‘voluntary access’ to elements of public life, such as attending large events or entertainment and dining venues, which are controlled by testing, evidence of previous immunity or vaccination status through a form of certification or proof.\n\nIt is valuable to record both mandatory vaccine policies and voluntary vaccine pass/passport policies. This differentiated coding is reported in our NPI dataset with ‘V’ and ‘NV’ designations (for example, ‘C1V_School closing’ and C1NV_School closing’) and is distinct from the ‘V4 - mandatory vaccination’ indicator reported in this paper.\n\nData collection\n\nWe collected and published data on publicly available sources, which are freely available through internet searches. These are found on government websites, policy briefs and reputable news outlets. The best-quality sources are original policy documents and high-quality media outlets. These sources are codified into the OxCGRT data protocol and entered into the database. A detailed qualitative note (written in English) and web-archived source are provided for context.\n\nThe V1–V4 data for the national dataset were initially collected by OxCGRT researchers and a small group of experienced and specially trained volunteer data collectors who received specific training. As of 1 January 2022, data collection for V1–V4 was integrated into the core OxCGRT data collection process, which involves an international team of hundreds of volunteer data collectors covering 90+ unique languages. Where language was a barrier, and where English sources could not be found, local speakers from the pool of OxCGRT contributors were consulted, or translation tools such as Google Translate were utilized. The majority of data collectors are/were postgraduate students at universities around the world. Each data collector completed a bespoke online e-learning course, which took around 45 min to complete, covering the V1–V4 indicators, key coding interpretation points and data quality. Every week of data collection was reviewed by a member of the OxCGRT team for quality and accuracy, and was further reviewed by a trained V1–V4 specific volunteer reviewer (also trained via a bespoke reviewer training e-learning course) and confirmed in the database over the medium to longer term. On GitHub, we published both a codebook and an interpretation guide to standardize interpretation and ensure that all coders were making the same logical choices for data entry. We also published a ‘best fit’ table which records where categories have been substituted when there is a category announced in a policy that is not listed in V1/2, ensuring the standardization of ‘best fit’ interpretation (Supplementary Table 4). This highlights the importance of the ‘notes’ function for each indicator, enabling an in-depth qualitative analysis of the data beyond the numerical summaries. Qualitative notes in our comma-separated values files (CSVs) can be used to find archived original policy documents and specific groups prioritized in each country if a best fit has been used.\n\nData publication and summary indicators\n\nThe data are published in a standalone ‘Vaccines_full.csv’ on GitHub, which includes all the 52 categories for V1–V4. They are also summarized in 9 summary indicators, which report one single number for V1 (vaccination prioritization), V2 (vaccination eligibility/availability) categories (overall summary, general population age floor, at-risk age floor, medically clinically vulnerable (non-elderly), education, frontline workers (non-healthcare), frontline workers (healthcare)) and V3. These summary indicators are included in most of our data CSVs on GitHub, including the NPI dataset ‘OxCGRT_nat_latest.csv’. The data are published in real time and updated each week by the team of international data collectors.\n\nIndependent data quality check\n\nWe conducted a data quality and accuracy check, where two core team researchers checked the data and original source material for 100 randomly selected data entry points, focusing on the period of time when the majority of new policies and policy changes were being made, and during which the majority of data were entered for all four vaccination policy indicators. The researchers independently verified that 90% of the original data entries in the database were correct, by analysing original source material and checking this alongside the database entries. The remaining 10 entries were corrected. Specifics such as date of announcement vs date of policy effect, accuracy of selected groups and ages, and ensuring that any recorded mandates were in fact government mandates were among the various checks in this independent data quality review process.\n\nAs part of the weekly data update cycle, a small team of specially trained reviewers are tasked with checking and confirming data entered. As part of this review process, changes to the data are made retroactively, meaning values on past dates may change. As a result, we recommend downloading the most recent data and stating the download date when using them for analysis. The data used for this paper up to 15 June 2022 have been checked thoroughly by the authors. On the rare occasion where data could not be verified or confirmed by local sources, or via translation, they were not included. An unintentional consequence of this is that a group that was prioritized/eligible/mandated to receive a COVID-19 vaccine may not have been captured by our dataset.\n\nComparison to other data sources\n\nWe do not know of any other datasets publishing systematic data on COVID-19 vaccine policies. This unique source therefore adds considerable value to other datasets. For example, the Reuters COVID-19 vaccination tracker, although no longer updating data, reported the prioritization plan (similar to V1 - vaccine prioritization), availability and eligibility (similar to V2 - vaccination eligibility/availability) of different groups for vaccination in each country, although this does not provide the original archived source material, dates or a time series dataset to evidence when groups became eligible (https://www.reuters.com/graphics/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/). The Africa CDC Vaccine Dashboard also reports the date vaccination campaign commenced (similar to V2) in African nations, although it does not provide original archived source material, or state when which groups began to receive vaccines (https://africacdc.org/covid-19-vaccination/). Coronanet includes questions on the number of priority groups for vaccine distribution (similar to V1) but only through 2021 (https://www.coronanet-project.org/assets/CoronaNet_Codebook.pdf).\n\nVaccine policy data are particularly useful when combined with information on the number of vaccine doses administered. For example, the OxCGRT vaccine policy data are displayed as part of Our World in Data’s COVID-19 vaccinations website resource3, which combines country-specific vaccination data into a single resource. Our data can be compared to variables such as proportion of the population that has received one dose, vaccination uptake rates and number of doses administered, to consider the effects of vaccination policies on these. Our H7 indicator, which is a summary of our V2 vaccination policy indicator, is also displayed here. The data are also used by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and WHO’s Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity (https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/), demonstrating their value in informing an interactive accessible tool to reflect the data on the COVID-19 rollout to ensure equitable access.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/graphics/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/', 'Headline': 'COVID-19 vaccine rollout: charts, maps and eligibility by country', 'Snippet': 'COVID-19 vaccination data can be reported by countries as the total number of doses administered and/or the number of people vaccinated.

Our journalists are collecting, verifying and updating information on vaccine availability and eligibility as the plans are announced and implemented by governments and health authorities around the world.\n\nReuters is also analysing how quickly countries are vaccinating their populations, using data collected from over 130 countries by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination data can be reported by countries as the total number of doses administered and/or the number of people vaccinated. Because most coronavirus vaccines require two doses, many countries also report the number of people who have received just one dose and the number who have been fully vaccinated.\n\nMany of the charts on this page show the number of people who have received at least one dose of a vaccine, which can offer significant protection against severe disease and reduce the risk of transmission, according to some studies.\n\nIf a country only reports the number of doses they have administered in total, we do not know the number of people who have been vaccinated. Those countries are excluded from our charts and statistics about people vaccinated.\n\nHow fast are countries vaccinating?\n\nDo some countries have an advantage?\n\nYes, generally richer and more developed countries have better health care infrastructure to manufacture, acquire and administer doses.\n\nAbout 24 % of people who have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine were from high income countries, and at least 0 % were from Europe and North America. (Again, that only includes data from countries that report these figures.)\n\nShow by\n\nWho is getting vaccinated?\n\nBecause of the limited availability of vaccines, most countries are prioritizing certain groups of people to receive their shots before others. People who are older or more likely to become very ill or die from COVID-19 are usually prioritized over those who are young and healthy. Some groups are prioritized because they are more likely to come into contact with an infected person based on what they do or where they live and, in turn, infect others.\n\nReuters has collected information on these priority groups for dozens of countries and determined which groups are currently eligible for vaccination.\n\nTap through the table below to see detailed information for each country. We will update this page as more countries acquire vaccines and announce their rollout plans.\n\nYou need to know\n\nReuters will strive to keep this data updated, but it may lag behind the current situation in your country. Consult your local health department for the most up-to-date information on whether you are eligible to receive a vaccine. (You can often find a link in the table below.)\n\nFor comparison purposes, Reuters has standardized the names of rollout phases and priority groups. For groups given access based on complex conditions, such as where people work or a pre-existing medical condition, a more detailed description of that group is also included in the table.\n\nTap to know more\n\nInfections\n\n% of peak\n\nDeaths\n\n% of peak\n\nPercent of population given at least one dose of vaccine\n\nPercent given at least 1 dose of vaccine\n\nVaccination phase\n\n42%\n\n3%\n\nPeak\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n24%\n\n2%\n\n95%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n94%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n94%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n16%\n\n93%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n4%\n\n1%\n\n91%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n1%\n\n91%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n3%\n\n91%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n15%\n\n2%\n\n90%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n6%\n\n1%\n\n89%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n89%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n49%\n\n50%\n\n88%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n49%\n\n18%\n\n88%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n87%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n10%\n\n1%\n\n87%\n\n5\n\nof 5\n\n12%\n\n5%\n\n87%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n28%\n\n8%\n\n87%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n9%\n\n87%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n49%\n\n97%\n\n87%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n12%\n\n14%\n\n87%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n7%\n\n4%\n\n87%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n11%\n\n3%\n\n84%\n\n6\n\nof 6\n\n56%\n\n13%\n\n84%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n1%\n\n83%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n9%\n\n7%\n\n82%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n70%\n\n9%\n\n82%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n8%\n\n8%\n\n81%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n23%\n\n8%\n\n81%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n13%\n\n3%\n\n80%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n80%\n\n7%\n\n2%\n\n79%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n16%\n\n13%\n\n79%\n\n78%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n8%\n\n3%\n\n77%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n38%\n\n9%\n\n77%\n\n5\n\nof 5\n\n7%\n\n1%\n\n77%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n9%\n\n3%\n\n77%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n24%\n\n6%\n\n76%\n\n2\n\nof 3\n\n1%\n\n76%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n12%\n\n3%\n\n75%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n5%\n\n74%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n5%\n\n1%\n\n74%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n11%\n\n8%\n\n74%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n96%\n\n23%\n\n73%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n5%\n\n4%\n\n73%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n73%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n95%\n\n11%\n\n71%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n14%\n\n1%\n\n71%\n\n6\n\nof 6\n\n63%\n\n4%\n\n70%\n\n5\n\nof 5\n\n5%\n\n1%\n\n70%\n\n2\n\nof 3\n\n6%\n\n1%\n\n70%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n69%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n16%\n\n3%\n\n68%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n67%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n7%\n\n2%\n\n65%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n4%\n\n1%\n\n65%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n20%\n\n1%\n\n64%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n64%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n6%\n\n1%\n\n63%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n24%\n\n1%\n\n63%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n32%\n\n5%\n\n61%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\n59%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n13%\n\n7%\n\n56%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\n56%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n55%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n43%\n\n55%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n53%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n4%\n\n51%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n50%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\nPeak\n\n22%\n\n50%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\n49%\n\n3\n\nof 4\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n48%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n47%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n43%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n3%\n\n43%\n\n4\n\nof 5\n\n42%\n\n8%\n\n42%\n\n1\n\nof 3\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n39%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n39%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n1%\n\n38%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n37%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n5%\n\n35%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n1%\n\n35%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n4%\n\n35%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n11%\n\n35%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n35%\n\n5\n\nof 5\n\n2%\n\n33%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n6%\n\n1%\n\n28%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n27%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n27%\n\n1%\n\n27%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n26%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n1%\n\n26%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n5%\n\n26%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n6%\n\n3%\n\n24%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n1%\n\n20%\n\n5\n\nof 5\n\n19%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n1%\n\n19%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n9%\n\n18%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n6%\n\n17%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n1%\n\n16%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n2%\n\n15%\n\n1\n\nof 2\n\n2%\n\n15%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n7%\n\n14%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n4%\n\n12%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\n10%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n9%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n6%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n5%\n\n3%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n17%\n\n2%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\nData sources\n\nLocal state agencies, local media, Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker, Our World in Data, The World Bank, Reuters research\n\nDesign and development\n\nGurman Bhatia, Prasanta Kumar Dutta, Chris Canipe and Jon McClure\n\nData collection and research\n\nAbhishek Manikandan, Aditya Munjuluru, Ahmed Farhatha, Amal Maqbool, Aniruddha Chakrabarty, Anna Banacka, Anna Pruchnicka, Anurag Maan, Anuron Kumar Mitra, Arpit Nayak, Arundhati Sarkar, Cate Cadell, Chaithra J, Chinmay Rautmare, Christine Chan, Daniela Desantis, Diana Mandia Alvarez, Elizaveta Gladun, Emily Isaacman, Enrico Sciacovelli, Gautami Khandke, Gayle Issa, Hardik Vyas, Harshith Aranya, Javier Lopez, Joao Manuel Vicente Mauricio, Juliette Portala, K.
